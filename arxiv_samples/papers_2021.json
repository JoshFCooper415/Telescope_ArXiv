      "abstract": "The Multi-armed bandit offer the advantage to learn and exploit the already\nlearnt knowledge at the same time. This capability allows this approach to be\napplied in different domains, going from clinical trials where the goal is\ninvestigating the effects of different experimental treatments while minimizing\npatient losses, to adaptive routing where the goal is to minimize the delays in\na network. This article provides a review of the recent results on applying\nbandit to real-life scenario and summarize the state of the art for each of\nthese fields. Different techniques has been proposed to solve this problem\nsetting, like epsilon-greedy, Upper confident bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling\n(TS). We are showing here how this algorithms were adapted to solve the\ndifferent problems of exploration exploitation.",

      "abstract": "The change in the energy of the moving heavy (charm and bottom) quarks due to\nfield fluctuations present in the hot QCD medium has been studied. A finite\nquark chemical potential has been considered while modeling the hot QCD medium\ncounting the fact that the upcoming experimental facilities such as Anti-proton\nand Ion Research (FAIR) and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) are\nexpected to operate at finite baryon density and moderate temperature. The\neffective kinetic theory approach has been adopted where the collisions have\nbeen incorporated using the well defined collisional kernel, known as\nBhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK). To incorporate the non-ideal equations of state\n(EoSs) effects/ medium interaction effects, an extended effective fugacity\nmodel has been adopted. The momentum dependence of the energy change due to\nfluctuation for the charm and bottom quark has been investigated at different\nvalues of collision frequency and chemical potential. The results are exciting\nas the heavy quarks are found to gain energy due to fluctuations while moving\nthrough the produced medium at finite chemical potential and collision\nfrequency.",

      "abstract": "Stress and driving are a dangerous combination which can lead to crashes, as\nevidenced by the large number of road traffic crashes that involve stress.\nMotivated by the need to address the significant costs of driver stress, it is\nessential to build a practical system that can classify driver stress level\nwith high accuracy. However, the performance of an accurate driving stress\nlevels classification system depends on hyperparameter optimization choices\nsuch as data segmentation (windowing hyperparameters). The configuration\nsetting of hyperparameters, which has an enormous impact on the system\nperformance, are typically hand-tuned while evaluating the algorithm. This\ntuning process is time consuming and often depends on personal experience.\nThere are also no generic optimal values for hyperparameters values. In this\nwork, we propose a meta-heuristic approach to support automated hyperparameter\noptimization and provide a real-time driver stress detection system. This is\nthe first systematic study of optimizing windowing hyperparameters based on\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) signal in the domain of driving safety. Our approach is\nto propose a framework based on Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) to\nselect an optimal/near optimal windowing hyperparameters values. The\nperformance of the proposed framework is evaluated on two datasets: a public\ndataset (DRIVEDB dataset) and our collected dataset using an advanced\nsimulator. DRIVEDB dataset was collected in a real time driving scenario, and\nour dataset was collected using an advanced driving simulator in the control\nenvironment. We demonstrate that optimising the windowing hyperparameters\nyields significant improvement in terms of accuracy. The most accurate built\nmodel applied to the public dataset and our dataset, based on the selected\nwindowing hyperparameters, achieved 92.12% and 77.78% accuracy, respectively.",

      "abstract": "This work establishes a deep connection between two seemingly distant\nbranches of nuclear physics: nuclear structure and relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions. At the heart of this connection is the recent discovery made at\nparticle colliders that the elliptic flow of outgoing hadrons in central\nnucleus-nucleus collisions is strongly impacted by the quadrupole deformation\nof the colliding nuclear species. I review the physics of the soft sector of\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions, and I explain that the interpretation of\nelliptic flow data in central $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au, $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U, and\n$^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe collisions requires a deep understanding the structure of\nthese ions. Subsequently, I introduce a technique that permits one to isolate\ncollision configurations in which the deformed shapes of the colliding nuclei\nmaximally break rotational (azimuthal) symmetry in the interaction region. This\nallows me to construct observables that possess an unparalleled sensitivity to\nthe quadrupole deformation of the colliding ions, and thus to conclude that\nnuclear experiments at high energy can be used to place new quantitative\nconstraints on the deformation of atomic nuclei. I emphasize the great\nopportunities offered by potential collider experiments aimed at the systematic\nstudy of nuclear deformation across the valley of stability.",

In the iterative approach gap solutions exist which exhibit\nrestored chiral symmetry beyond a certain dynamical cut-off energy. A chirally\nbroken, non-chaotic domain with no emergent mass poles and hence with no\nquasi-particle excitations exists below this energy cutoff. The transition\ndomain between these two energy separated domains is chaotic. As a result, the\ndispersion relation is that of quarks with restored chiral symmetry, cut at a\ndynamical energy scale, determined by fractal structures. We argue that the\nchaotic origin of the infrared cut-off could hint at a chaotic nature of\nconfinement and the deconfinement phase transition.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on inverse reinforcement learning for autonomous\nnavigation using distance and semantic category observations. The objective is\nto infer a cost function that explains demonstrated behavior while relying only\non the expert's observations and state-control trajectory. We develop a map\nencoder, that infers semantic category probabilities from the observation\nsequence, and a cost encoder, defined as a deep neural network over the\nsemantic features. Since the expert cost is not directly observable, the model\nparameters can only be optimized by differentiating the error between\ndemonstrated controls and a control policy computed from the cost estimate. We\npropose a new model of expert behavior that enables error minimization using a\nclosed-form subgradient computed only over a subset of promising states via a\nmotion planning algorithm. Our approach allows generalizing the learned\nbehavior to new environments with new spatial configurations of the semantic\ncategories. We analyze the different components of our model in a minigrid\nenvironment. We also demonstrate that our approach learns to follow traffic\nrules in the autonomous driving CARLA simulator by relying on semantic\nobservations of buildings, sidewalks, and road lanes.",

However, subsequent developments\ncontinued to reveal a much richer and deeper structure of fundamental\ninteractions on the nano- and micro-scale: the granularity and structure of the\nsolvent, charging equilibria of dissociable charge groups, inhomogeneous charge\ndistributions, the finite size of the ions, non-mean-field electrostatics,\nion-ion correlations, and more. Today, the original simplicity is gone and we\nare left with an embarrassingly rich variety of interactions that defy simple\nclassification and reduction to a few fundamental mechanisms. In this\nmini-review, we comment on the contemporary state-of-the-art picture of\ncolloidal interactions, in view of some recent progress in experiments.",

In\nthis paper, we propose prefix-tuning, a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning\nfor natural language generation tasks, which keeps language model parameters\nfrozen, but optimizes a small continuous task-specific vector (called the\nprefix). Prefix-tuning draws inspiration from prompting, allowing subsequent\ntokens to attend to this prefix as if it were \"virtual tokens\". We apply\nprefix-tuning to GPT-2 for table-to-text generation and to BART for\nsummarization.

Due to the high computational cost of\nmatched filtering pipeline, there is a hunt for an alternative powerful system.\nI present, for the first time, the use of 1D residual neural network for\ndetection of gravitational waves. Residual networks have transformed many\nfields like image classification, face recognition and object detection with\ntheir robust structure. With increase in sensitivity of LIGO detectors we\nexpect many more sources of gravitational waves in the universe to be detected.\nHowever, deep learning networks are trained only once. When used for\nclassification task, deep neural networks are trained to predict only a fixed\nnumber of classes. Therefore, when a new type of gravitational wave is to be\ndetected, this turns out to be a drawback of deep learning. Shallow neural\nnetworks can be used to learn data with simple patterns but fail to give good\nresults with increase in complexity of data. Remodelling the neural network\nwith detection of each new type of GW is highly infeasible. In this letter, I\nalso discuss ways to reduce the time required to adapt to such changes in\ndetection of gravitational waves for deep learning methods. Primarily, I aim to\ncreate a custom residual neural network for 1-dimensional time series inputs,\nwhich can learn a ton of features from dataset without giving up on increasing\nthe number of classes or increasing the complexity of data.

      "abstract": "BERT, as one of the pretrianed language models, attracts the most attention\nin recent years for creating new benchmarks across GLUE tasks via fine-tuning.\nOne pressing issue is to open up the blackbox and explain the decision makings\nof BERT. A number of attribution techniques have been proposed to explain BERT\nmodels, but are often limited to sequence to sequence tasks. In this paper, we\nadapt existing attribution methods on explaining decision makings of BERT in\nsequence classification tasks. We conduct extensive analyses of four existing\nattribution methods by applying them to four different datasets in sentiment\nanalysis. We compare the reliability and robustness of each method via various\nablation studies. Furthermore, we test whether attribution methods explain\ngeneralized semantics across semantically similar tasks. Our work provides\nsolid guidance for using attribution methods to explain decision makings of\nBERT for downstream classification tasks.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the cooperative planning and control problem for\nmultiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in different scenarios. In the\nexisting literature, most of the methods suffer from significant problems in\ncomputational efficiency. Besides, as the optimization problem is nonlinear and\nnonconvex, it typically poses great difficultly in determining the optimal\nsolution. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel and completely\nparallel computation framework by leveraging the alternating direction method\nof multipliers (ADMM). The nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem in the\nautonomous driving problem can be divided into two manageable subproblems; and\nthe resulting subproblems can be solved by using effective optimization methods\nin a parallel framework. Here, the differential dynamic programming (DDP)\nalgorithm is capable of addressing the nonlinearity of the system dynamics\nrather effectively; and the nonconvex coupling constraints with small\ndimensions can be approximated by invoking the notion of semi-definite\nrelaxation (SDR), which can also be solved in a very short time. Due to the\nparallel computation and efficient relaxation of nonconvex constraints, our\nproposed approach effectively realizes real-time implementation and thus also\nextra assurance of driving safety is provided. In addition, two transportation\nscenarios for multiple CAVs are used to illustrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the proposed method.",

These results create ever tighter\nconstraints on the formation and growth mechanisms of early black holes. Here\nwe show that even the most extreme black hole known, P\\=oniu\\=a'ena, can grow\nfrom a $10 M_\\odot$ seed black hole via Eddington-limited luminous accretion,\nprovided that accretion proceeds almost continuously, but is composed of a\nlarge number of episodes with individually-uncorrelated initial directions.\nThis chaotic accretion scenario ensures that the growing black hole spins\nslowly, with the dimensionless spin parameter $a \\lesssim 0.2$, so its\nradiative efficiency is also low, $\\epsilon \\simeq 0.06$. If accretion is even\npartially aligned, with $20-40\\%$ of accretion events happening in the same\ndirection, the black hole spin and radiative efficiency are much higher,\nleading to significantly slower growth. We suggest that the chaotic accretion\nscenario can be completely falsified only if a $10^9 M_\\odot$ black hole is\ndiscovered at $z \\geq 9.1$, approximately $150$~Myr before P\\=oniu\\=a'ena. The\nspace density of extreme quasars suggests that only a very small fraction,\nroughly one in $4 \\times 10^7$, of seed black holes need to encounter\nfavourable growth conditions to produce the observed extreme quasars. Other\nseed black holes grow much less efficiently, mainly due to lower duty cycles,\nso are much more difficult to detect.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of charge exchange between a solid surface and a\nliquid is fundamental to various situations, ranging from nanofiltration to\ncatalysis and electrochemistry. Charge transfer is ultimately determined by\nphysicochemical processes (surface group dissociation, ion adsorption, etc...)\noccurring in the few layers of molecules at the interface between the solid and\nthe liquid. Unfortunately, these processes remain largely uncharted due to the\nexperimental challenges in probing interfacial charge dynamics with\nsufficiently high spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we resolve at the\nsingle-charge scale, the dynamics of proton charges at the interface between an\nhBN crystal and binary mixtures of water and organic amphiphilic solvents (e.g.\nalcohol), evidencing a dramatic influence of solvation on interfacial dynamics.\nOur observations rely on the application of spectral Single Molecule\nLocalization Microscopy (sSMLM) to two types of optically active defects at the\nhBN surface, which act as intrinsic optical markers for both surface\nprotonation and interaction with apolar alkyl groups of the organic solvent. We\nuse sSMLM to reveal interfacial proton charge transport as a succession of\njumps between the titratable surface defects, mediated by the transport of the\nsolvated proton charge along the solid/liquid interface. By changing the\nrelative concentration of water in binary mixtures, we evidence a non-trivial\neffect on interfacial proton charge dynamics, leading at intermediate water\nconcentration to an increased affinity of the proton charge to the solid\nsurface, accompanied by an increased surface diffusivity. These measurements\nconfirm the strong role of solvation on interfacial proton charge transport and\nestablish the potential of single-molecule localization techniques to probe a\nwide range of dynamic processes at solid/liquid interfaces.",

      "abstract": "Smart home solutions increasingly rely on a variety of sensors for behavioral\nanalytics and activity recognition to provide context-aware applications and\npersonalized care. Optimizing the sensor network is one of the most important\napproaches to ensure classification accuracy and the system's efficiency.\nHowever, the trade-off between the cost and performance is often a challenge in\nreal deployments, particularly for multiple-occupancy smart homes or care\nhomes.\n  In this paper, using real indoor activity and mobility traces, floor plans,\nand synthetic multi-occupancy behavior models, we evaluate several\nmulti-occupancy household scenarios with 2-5 residents. We explore and quantify\nthe trade-offs between the cost of sensor deployments and expected labeling\naccuracy in different scenarios. Our evaluation across different scenarios show\nthat the performance of the desired context-aware task is affected by different\nlocalization resolutions, the number of residents, the number of sensors, and\nvarying sensor deployments. To aid in accelerating the adoption of practical\nsensor-based activity recognition technology, we design MoSen, a framework to\nsimulate the interaction dynamics between sensor-based environments and\nmultiple residents. By evaluating the factors that affect the performance of\nthe desired sensor network, we provide a sensor selection strategy and design\nmetrics for sensor layout in real environments. Using our selection strategy in\na 5-person scenario case study, we demonstrate that MoSen can significantly\nimprove overall system performance without increasing the deployment costs.",

      "title": "On Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient Method for Semidefinite\n  Optimization",
      "abstract": "The low-rank stochastic semidefinite optimization has attracted rising\nattention due to its wide range of applications. The nonconvex reformulation\nbased on the low-rank factorization, significantly improves the computational\nefficiency but brings some new challenge to the analysis. The stochastic\nvariance reduced gradient (SVRG) method has been regarded as one of the most\neffective methods. SVRG in general consists of two loops, where a reference\nfull gradient is first evaluated in the outer loop and then used to yield a\nvariance reduced estimate of the current gradient in the inner loop. Two\noptions have been suggested to yield the output of the inner loop, where Option\nI sets the output as its last iterate, and Option II yields the output via\nrandom sampling from all the iterates in the inner loop. However, there is a\nsignificant gap between the theory and practice of SVRG when adapted to the\nstochastic semidefinite programming (SDP). SVRG practically works better with\nOption I, while most of existing theoretical results focus on Option II. In\nthis paper, we fill this gap via exploiting a new semi-stochastic variant of\nthe original SVRG with Option I adapted to the semidefinite optimization.\nEquipped with this, we establish the global linear submanifold convergence\n(i.e., converging exponentially fast to a submanifold of a global minimum under\nthe orthogonal group action) of the proposed SVRG method, given a provable\ninitialization scheme and under certain smoothness and restricted strongly\nconvex assumptions. Our analysis includes the effects of the mini-batch size\nand update frequency in the inner loop as well as two practical step size\nstrategies, the fixed and stabilized Barzilai-Borwein step sizes. Some\nnumerical results in matrix sensing demonstrate the efficiency of proposed SVRG\nmethod outperforming Option II counterpart as well as others.",

An evacuation experiment was carried out by our group in Shanghai\nTower, it was found that the evacuation speed of pedestrians evacuated from the\n126th floor was always slower than that of those from the 117th floor.\nTherefore, we propose a hypothesis that the expected evacuation distance will\naffect pedestrians' movement speed. In order to verify our conjecture, we\nconduct an experiment in a 12-story office building, that is, to study whether\nthere would be an influence and what kind of influence would be caused on speed\nby setting the evacuation distance for participants in advance. According to\nthe results, we find that with the increase of expected evacuation distance,\nthe movement speed of pedestrians will decrease, which confirms our hypothesis.\nAt the same time, we give the relation between the increase rate of evacuation\ndistance and the decrease rate of speed. It also can be found that with the\nincrease of expected evacuation distance, the speed decrease rate of the male\nis greater than that for female. In addition, we study the effects of actual\nevacuation distance, gender, BMI on evacuation speed. Finally, we obtain the\ncorrelation between heart rate and speed during evacuation.

      "abstract": "Adaptive learning rate methods have been successfully applied in many fields,\nespecially in training deep neural networks. Recent results have shown that\nadaptive methods with exponential increasing weights on squared past gradients\n(i.e., ADAM, RMSPROP) may fail to converge to the optimal solution. Though many\nalgorithms, such as AMSGRAD and ADAMNC, have been proposed to fix the\nnon-convergence issues, achieving a data-dependent regret bound similar to or\nbetter than ADAGRAD is still a challenge to these methods. In this paper, we\npropose a novel adaptive method weighted adaptive algorithm (WADA) to tackle\nthe non-convergence issues. Unlike AMSGRAD and ADAMNC, we consider using a\nmilder growing weighting strategy on squared past gradient, in which weights\ngrow linearly. Based on this idea, we propose weighted adaptive gradient method\nframework (WAGMF) and implement WADA algorithm on this framework. Moreover, we\nprove that WADA can achieve a weighted data-dependent regret bound, which could\nbe better than the original regret bound of ADAGRAD when the gradients decrease\nrapidly. This bound may partially explain the good performance of ADAM in\npractice. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WADA\nand its variants in comparison with several variants of ADAM on training convex\nproblems and deep neural networks.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the locally conservative enriched immersed finite\nelement method (EIFEM) to tackle the elliptic problem with interface. The\nimmersed finite element is useful for handling interface with mesh unfit with\nthe interface. However, all the currently available method under IFEM framework\nmay not be designed to consider the flux conservation. We provide an efficient\nand effective remedy for this issue by introducing a local piecewise constant\nenrichment, which provides the locally conservative flux. We have also\nconstructed and analyzed an auxiliary space preconditioner for the resulting\nsystem based on the application of algebraic multigrid method. The new\nobservation in this work is that by imposing strong Dirichlet boundary\ncondition for the standard IFEM part of EIFEM, we are able to remove the zero\neigen-mode of the EIFEM system while still imposing the Dirichlet boundary\ncondition weakly assigned to the piecewise constant enrichment part of EIFEM. A\ncouple of issues relevant to the piecewise constant enrichment given for the\nmesh unfit to the interface has been discussed and clarified as well. Numerical\ntests are provided to confirm the theoretical development.",

By Bayes rule, the external information (prior distribution) and\nthe internal information (training data likelihood) are combined coherently,\nand the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive (marginal)\ndistribution obtained by Bayes rule summarize the total information needed in\nthe inference and prediction, respectively. In this paper, we study the\nBayesian framework of the Tensor Network from two perspective. First, we\nintroduce the prior distribution to the weights in the Tensor Network and\npredict the labels of the new observations by the posterior predictive\n(marginal) distribution. Since the intractability of the parameter integral in\nthe normalization constant computation, we approximate the posterior predictive\ndistribution by Laplace approximation and obtain the out-product approximation\nof the hessian matrix of the posterior distribution of the Tensor Network\nmodel. Second, to estimate the parameters of the stationary mode, we propose a\nstable initialization trick to accelerate the inference process by which the\nTensor Network can converge to the stationary path more efficiently and stably\nwith gradient descent method. We verify our work on the MNIST, Phishing Website\nand Breast Cancer data set. We study the Bayesian properties of the Bayesian\nTensor Network by visualizing the parameters of the model and the decision\nboundaries in the two dimensional synthetic data set.

The market agent's risk\npreferences are modelled using a so-called forward performance process (forward\nutility), which is a time-decreasing utility of exponential type. Moreover, the\nmarket agent (investor) does not know with certainty the values of the asset\nprice drifts. This market setting with drift parameter uncertainty is the\npartial information scenario. We discuss the stochastic control problem\nobtained by setting up the hedging portfolio and derive the optimal hedging\nstrategy. Furthermore, a (dual) forward indifference price representation of\nthe claim and its PDE are obtained. With these results, the residual risk\nprocess representing the basis risk (hedging error), pay-off decompositions and\nasymptotic expansions of the indifference price in the European case are\nderived.

We studied how sensitive users'\nwell-being is to features' type, and to their cost level and type.

      "abstract": "Motivated by the recent trend of integrating artificial intelligence into the\nInternet-of-Things (IoT), we consider the problem of scheduling packets from\nmultiple sensing sources to a central controller over a wireless network. Here,\npackets from different sensing sources have different values or degrees of\nimportance to the central controller for intelligent decision making. In such a\nsetup, it is critical to provide timely and valuable information for the\ncentral controller. In this paper, we develop a parameterized maximum-weight\ntype scheduling policy that combines both the AoI metrics and Upper Confidence\nBound (UCB) estimates in its weight measure with parameter $\\eta$. Here, UCB\nestimates balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in learning\nand are critical for yielding a small cumulative regret. We show that our\nproposed algorithm yields the running average total age at most by\n$O(N^2\\eta)$. We also prove that our proposed algorithm achieves the cumulative\nregret over time horizon $T$ at most by $O(NT/\\eta+\\sqrt{NT\\log T})$. This\nreveals a tradeoff between the cumulative regret and the running average total\nage: when increasing $\\eta$, the cumulative regret becomes smaller, but is at\nthe cost of increasing running average total age.

Despite the collective effort towards deriving an\nadvanced extension of a 3D human performance model based on Fitts' law, a\nstandardized metric is still missing.

      "abstract": "A theoretical investigation has been made of the magnetoplasmon excitations\nin a quasi-one-dimensional electron system comprised of vertically stacked,\nself-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots. The smaller length scales involved in\nthe experiments impel us to consider a perfectly periodic system of\ntwo-dimensionally confined InAs quantum dot layers separated by GaAs spacers.\nSubsequent system is subjected to a two-dimensional confining (harmonic)\npotential in the x-y plane and an applied magnetic field (B) in the symmetric\ngauge. This scheme defines virtually a system of quantum wire comprised of\nvertically stacked quantum dots (VSQD). We derive and discuss the Dyson\nequation, the generalized (nonlocal and dynamic) dielectric function, and the\ninverse dielectric function for investigating the single-particle and\ncollective (magnetoplasmon) excitations within the framework of (full)\nrandom-phase approximation (RPA). As an application, we study the influence of\nthe confinement potential and the magnetic field on the component\neigenfunctions, the density of states (DOS), the Fermi energy, the collective\nexcitations, and the inverse dielectric functions. These findings demonstrate,\nfor the very first time, the significance of investigating the system of VSQD\nsubjected to a quantizing magnetic field. Given the edge over the planar\nquantum dots and the foreseen applications in the single-electron devices and\nquantum computation, investigating the system of VSQD is deemed vital. The\nresults suggest exploiting magnetoplasmon qubits to be a potential option for\nimplementing the solemn idea of quantum state transfer in devising quantum\ngates for the quantum computation and quantum communication networks.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric exoskeletons offer great promise to increase mobility for children\nwith crouch gait caused by cerebral palsy. A lightweight, compliant and\nuser-specific actuator is critical for maximizing the benefits of an\nexoskeleton to users. To date, pediatric exoskeletons generally use the same\nactuators as adult exoskeletons, which are heavy and resistive to natural\nmovement. There is yet no easy way for robotic exoskeletons to accommodate the\nchanges in design requirements that occur as a child ages. We developed a\nlightweight (1.65 kg unilateral mass) and compliant pediatric knee exoskeleton\nwith a bandwidth of 22.6 Hz that can provide torque assistance to children with\ncrouch gait using high torque density motor. Experimental results demonstrated\nthat the robot exhibited low mechanical impedance (1.79 Nm average backdrive\ntorque) under the unpowered condition and 0.32 Nm with zero-torque tracking\ncontrol. Root mean square (RMS) error of torque tracking result is less than\n0.73 Nm (5.7% with respect to 12 Nm torque). To achieve optimal age-specific\nperformance, we proposed the first optimization framework that considered both\nmotor and transmission of the actuator system that can produce optimal settings\nfor children between 3 and 18 years old. The optimization generated an optimal\nmotor air gap radius that monotonically increases with age from 0.011 to 0.033\nmeters, and optimal gear ratio varies from 2.6 to 11.6 (3-13 years old) and\n11.6 to 10.2 (13-18 years old), leading to actuators of minimal mass.",

      "abstract": "Terrain adaptation is an essential capability for a ground robot to\neffectively traverse unstructured off-road terrain in real-world field\nenvironments such as forests. However, the expected robot behaviors generated\nby terrain adaptation methods cannot always be executed accurately due to\nsetbacks such as wheel slip and reduced tire pressure. To address this problem,\nwe propose a novel approach for consistent behavior generation that enables the\nground robot's actual behaviors to more accurately match expected behaviors\nwhile adapting to a variety of unstructured off-road terrain. Our approach\nlearns offset behaviors that are used to compensate for the inconsistency\nbetween the actual and expected behaviors without requiring the explicit\nmodeling of various setbacks. Our approach is also able to estimate the\nimportance of the multi-modal features to improve terrain representations for\nbetter adaptation. In addition, we develop an algorithmic solver for our\nformulated regularized optimization problem, which is guaranteed to converge to\nthe global optimal solution. To evaluate the method, we perform extensive\nexperiments using various unstructured off-road terrain in real-world field\nenvironments. Experimental results have validated that our approach enables\nrobots to traverse complex unstructured off-road terrain with more navigational\nbehavior consistency, and it outperforms previous methods, particularly so on\nchallenging terrain.",

      "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells adhere to extracellular matrix during the normal development\nof the organism, forming static adhesion as well as during cell motility. We\nstudy this process by considering a simplified coarse-grained model of a\nvesicle that has uniform adhesion energy with a flat substrate, mobile curved\nmembrane proteins and active forces. We find that a high concentration of\ncurved proteins alone increases the spreading of the vesicle, by the\nself-organization of the curved proteins at the high curvature\nvesicle-substrate contact line, thereby reducing the bending energy penalty at\nthe vesicle rim. This is most significant in the regime of low bare\nvesicle-substrate adhesion. When these curved proteins induce protrusive\nforces, representing the actin cytoskeleton, we find efficient spreading, in\nthe form of sheet-like lamellipodia. Finally, the same mechanism of spreading\nis found to include a minimal set of ingredients needed to give rise to motile\nphenotypes.",

      "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the knowledge on a\nlabeled source domain distribution to perform well on an unlabeled target\ndomain. Recently, the deep self-training involves an iterative process of\npredicting on the target domain and then taking the confident predictions as\nhard pseudo-labels for retraining. However, the pseudo-labels are usually\nunreliable, and easily leading to deviated solutions with propagated errors. In\nthis paper, we resort to the energy-based model and constrain the training of\nthe unlabeled target sample with the energy function minimization objective. It\ncan be applied as a simple additional regularization. In this framework, it is\npossible to gain the benefits of the energy-based model, while retaining strong\ndiscriminative performance following a plug-and-play fashion. We deliver\nextensive experiments on the most popular and large scale UDA benchmarks of\nimage classification as well as semantic segmentation to demonstrate its\ngenerality and effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "End-user-devices in the current cellular ecosystem are prone to many\ndifferent vulnerabilities across different generations and protocol layers.\nFixing these vulnerabilities retrospectively can be expensive, challenging, or\njust infeasible. A pragmatic approach for dealing with such a diverse set of\nvulnerabilities would be to identify attack attempts at runtime on the device\nside, and thwart them with mitigating and corrective actions. Towards this\ngoal, in the paper we propose a general and extendable approach called Phoenix\nfor identifying n-day cellular network control-plane vulnerabilities as well as\ndangerous practices of network operators from the device vantage point. Phoenix\nmonitors the device-side cellular network traffic for performing\nsignature-based unexpected behavior detection through lightweight runtime\nverification techniques. Signatures in Phoenix can be manually-crafted by a\ncellular network security expert or can be automatically synthesized using an\noptional component of Phoenix, which reduces the signature synthesis problem to\nthe language learning from the informant problem. Based on the corrective\nactions that are available to Phoenix when an undesired behavior is detected,\ndifferent instantiations of Phoenix are possible: a full-fledged defense when\ndeployed inside a baseband processor; a user warning system when deployed as a\nmobile application; a probe for identifying attacks in the wild. One such\ninstantiation of Phoenix was able to identify all 15 representative n-day\nvulnerabilities and unsafe practices of 4G LTE networks considered in our\nevaluation with a high packet processing speed (~68000 packets/second) while\ninducing only a moderate amount of energy overhead (~4mW).",

      "abstract": "We investigate the performance of wall-modeled LES for external aerodynamics\nin the NASA Juncture Flow. We characterize the errors in the prediction of mean\nvelocity profiles and pressure coefficient for three different locations over\nthe aircraft: the upstream region of the fuselage, the wing-body juncture, and\nthe wing-body juncture close to the trailing-edge. The last two locations are\ncharacterized by strong mean-flow three-dimensionality and separation. The\nmessage conveyed by our error analysis is that WMLES performs as expected in\nregions where the flow resembles a zero-pressure-gradient flat plate boundary\nlayer. However, there is a clear decline of the current models in the presence\nof wing-body junctions and, more acutely, in separated zones. The slow\nconvergence to the solution in these regions renders the brute-force\ngrid-refinement approach to improve the accuracy of the solution unfeasible.\nThe results reported above pertain to the mean velocity profile predicted using\nthe typical grid resolution for external aerodynamics applications, i.e., 5--20\npoints per boundary-layer thickness. The prediction of the pressure coefficient\nis below 5\\% error for all grid sizes considered, even when boundary layers\nwere marginally resolved. The latter accuracy can be attributed to the\nouter-layer nature of the mean pressure, which becomes less sensitive to flow\ndetails within the turbulent boundary layer. Finally, we show that\nboundary-layer-conforming grids (i.e., grids maintaining a constant number of\npoints per boundary-layer thickness) allow for a more efficient distribution of\ngrid points and smaller errors. Our results suggest that novel modeling venues\nencompassing physical insights, together with numerical and gridding\nadvancements, must be exploited to attain predictions within the tolerance\nrequired for Certification by Analysis.",

      "abstract": "This work presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system, based on the\nFaster Region-Based Convolution Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) framework, which\ndetects and counts apples from oblique, aerial drone imagery of giant\ncommercial orchards. To reduce computational cost, a novel precursory stage to\nthe network is designed to preprocess raw imagery into cropped images of\nindividual trees. Unique geospatial identifiers are allocated to these using\nthe perspective projection model. This employs Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) data,\nDigital Terrain and Surface Models (DTM and DSM), as well as internal and\nexternal camera parameters. The bulk of experiments however focus on tuning\nhyperparameters in the detection network itself. Apples which are on trees and\napples which are on the ground are treated as separate classes. A mean Average\nPrecision (mAP) metric, calibrated by the size of the two classes, is devised\nto mitigate spurious results. Anchor box design is of key interest due to the\nscale of the apples. As such, a k-means clustering approach, never before seen\nin literature for Faster R-CNN, resulted in the most significant improvements\nto calibrated mAP. Other experiments showed that the maximum number of box\nproposals should be 225; the initial learning rate of 0.001 is best applied to\nthe adaptive RMS Prop optimiser; and ResNet 101 is the ideal base feature\nextractor when considering mAP and, to a lesser extent, inference time. The\namalgamation of the optimal hyperparameters leads to a model with a calibrated\nmAP of 0.7627.",

However,\nfluorochromic materials that are photophysically resilient and show high\nsensitivity towards different physical and chemical stimuli are scarce. We\nreport a facile host-guest nanoconfinement strategy to construct a fluorescent\nhybrid material with multiple sensing capabilities. We design and fabricate a\nnew Guest@MOF material: comprising a zeolitic MOF (ZIF-71) as a nanoporous host\nfor encapsulating rhodamine B (RhB dye) guest molecules, resulting in the\nRhB@ZIF-71 system with mechanochromic, thermochromic, and solvatochromic\nsensing response. The fluorochromic sensing properties stem from the\nnanoconfinement effect that ZIF-71 imposes on RhB monomers, yielding the H- or\nJ-type aggregates with tuneable photophysical and photochemical properties. For\nmechanochromism, the external pressure causes an emission red shift in a linear\nfashion, switching RhB guests from H-type to J-type aggregates through a shear\ndeformation. For thermochromism, we demonstrate a linear scaling as a function\nof temperature due to the spatial restriction imposed on J-type aggregates\nincarcerated in ZIF-71 pores. Harnessing the solvatochromism of RhB@ZIF-71, we\nidentified three diverse groups of volatile organic compounds.

      "abstract": "In this book chapter, we study a problem of distributed content caching in an\nultra-dense edge caching network (UDCN), in which a large number of small base\nstations (SBSs) prefetch popular files to cope with the ever-growing user\ndemand in 5G and beyond. In a UDCN, even a small misprediction of user demand\nmay render a large amount of prefetched data obsolete. Furtherproacmore, the\ninterference variance is high due to the short inter-SBS distances, making it\ndifficult to quantify data downloading rates. Lastly, since the caching\ndecision of each SBS interacts with those of all other SBSs, the problem\ncomplexity of exponentially increases with the number of SBSs, which is unfit\nfor UDCNs. To resolve such challenging issues while reflecting time-varying and\nlocation-dependent user demand, we leverage mean-field game (MFG) theory\nthrough which each SBS interacts only with a single virtual SBS whose state is\ndrawn from the state distribution of the entire SBS population, i.e.,\nmean-field (MF) distribution. This MF approximation asymptotically guarantees\nachieving the epsilon Nash equilibrium as the number of SBSs approaches\ninfinity. To describe such an MFG-theoretic caching framework, this chapter\naims to provide a brief review of MFG, and demonstrate its effectiveness for\nUDCNs.",

The majority of existing robotic solutions for steel bridge\ninspection requires human intervention to assist in the control and navigation.\nIn this paper, a control and navigation framework has been proposed for the\nsteel bridge inspection robot developed by the Advanced Robotics and Automation\n(ARA)to facilitate autonomous real-time navigation and minimize human\nintervention. The ARA robot is designed to work in two modes: mobile and\ninch-worm. The robot uses mobile mode when moving on a plane surface and\ninch-worm mode when jumping from one surface to the other. To allow the ARA\nrobot to switch between mobile and inch-worm modes, a switching controller is\ndeveloped with 3D point cloud data based. The surface detection algorithm is\nproposed to allow the robot to check the availability of steel surfaces (plane,\narea, and height) to determine the transformation from mobile mode to inch-worm\none. To have the robot safely navigate and visit all steel members of the\nbridge, four algorithms are developed to process the data from a depth camera,\nsegment it into clusters, estimate the boundaries, construct a graph\nrepresenting the structure, generate the shortest inspection path with any\nstarting and ending points, and determine available robot configuration for\npath planning.

Traditional caching algorithms (e.g., LRU, LFU) are too\nsimple to capture the dynamics of video popularity, especially long-tailed\nvideos. Recent learning-driven caching algorithms (e.g., DeepCache) show\npromising performance, however, such black-box approaches are lack of\nexplainability and interpretability. Moreover, the parameter tuning requires a\nlarge number of historical records, which are difficult to obtain for videos\nwith low popularity. In this paper, we optimize video caching at the edge using\na white-box approach, which is highly efficient and also completely\nexplainable. To accurately capture the evolution of video popularity, we\ndevelop a mathematical model called \\emph{HRS} model, which is the combination\nof multiple point processes, including Hawkes' self-exciting, reactive and\nself-correcting processes. The key advantage of the HRS model is its\nexplainability, and much less number of model parameters. In addition, all its\nmodel parameters can be learned automatically through maximizing the\nLog-likelihood function constructed by past video request events. Next, we\nfurther design an online HRS-based video caching algorithm. To verify its\neffectiveness, we conduct a series of experiments using real video traces\ncollected from Tencent Video, one of the largest online video providers in\nChina. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art algorithms, with 12.3\\% improvement on average in terms of\ncache hit rate under realistic settings.",

      "abstract": "Deep hashing methods have shown great retrieval accuracy and efficiency in\nlarge-scale image retrieval. How to optimize discrete hash bits is always the\nfocus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these methods is to adopt\nan activation function, e.g. $\\operatorname{sigmoid}(\\cdot)$ or\n$\\operatorname{tanh}(\\cdot)$, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate\ndiscrete values. However, this paradigm may make more and more hash bits stuck\ninto the wrong saturated area of the activation functions and never escaped. We\ncall this problem \"Dead Bits Problem~(DBP)\". Besides, the existing quantization\nloss will aggravate DBP as well. In this paper, we propose a simple but\neffective gradient amplifier which acts before activation functions to\nalleviate DBP. Moreover, we devise an error-aware quantization loss to further\nalleviate DBP. It avoids the negative effect of quantization loss based on the\nsimilarity between two images. The proposed gradient amplifier and error-aware\nquantization loss are compatible with a variety of deep hashing methods.\nExperimental results on three datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the\nproposed gradient amplifier and the error-aware quantization loss.",

Taking inspiration from this, we introduce\nrepresentations and models centered on contact, which we then use in action\nprediction and anticipation. We annotate a subset of the EPIC Kitchens dataset\nto include time-to-contact between hands and objects, as well as segmentations\nof hands and objects. Using these annotations we train the Anticipation Module,\na module producing Contact Anticipation Maps and Next Active Object\nSegmentations - novel low-level representations providing temporal and spatial\ncharacteristics of anticipated near future action. On top of the Anticipation\nModule we apply Egocentric Object Manipulation Graphs (Ego-OMG), a framework\nfor action anticipation and prediction. Ego-OMG models longer term temporal\nsemantic relations through the use of a graph modeling transitions between\ncontact delineated action states. Use of the Anticipation Module within Ego-OMG\nproduces state-of-the-art results, achieving 1st and 2nd place on the unseen\nand seen test sets, respectively, of the EPIC Kitchens Action Anticipation\nChallenge, and achieving state-of-the-art results on the tasks of action\nanticipation and action prediction over EPIC Kitchens.

      "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is an effective approach to leverage a well-trained\nnetwork or an ensemble of them, named as the teacher, to guide the training of\na student network. The outputs from the teacher network are used as soft labels\nfor supervising the training of a new network. Recent studies\n\\citep{muller2019does,yuan2020revisiting} revealed an intriguing property of\nthe soft labels that making labels soft serves as a good regularization to the\nstudent network. From the perspective of statistical learning, regularization\naims to reduce the variance, however how bias and variance change is not clear\nfor training with soft labels. In this paper, we investigate the bias-variance\ntradeoff brought by distillation with soft labels. Specifically, we observe\nthat during training the bias-variance tradeoff varies sample-wisely. Further,\nunder the same distillation temperature setting, we observe that the\ndistillation performance is negatively associated with the number of some\nspecific samples, which are named as regularization samples since these samples\nlead to bias increasing and variance decreasing. Nevertheless, we empirically\nfind that completely filtering out regularization samples also deteriorates\ndistillation performance. Our discoveries inspired us to propose the novel\nweighted soft labels to help the network adaptively handle the sample-wise\nbias-variance tradeoff. Experiments on standard evaluation benchmarks validate\nthe effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/bellymonster/Weighted-Soft-Label-Distillation}.",

      "abstract": "Data heterogeneity has been identified as one of the key features in\nfederated learning but often overlooked in the lens of robustness to\nadversarial attacks. This paper focuses on characterizing and understanding its\nimpact on backdooring attacks in federated learning through comprehensive\nexperiments using synthetic and the LEAF benchmarks. The initial impression\ndriven by our experimental results suggests that data heterogeneity is the\ndominant factor in the effectiveness of attacks and it may be a redemption for\ndefending against backdooring as it makes the attack less efficient, more\nchallenging to design effective attack strategies, and the attack result also\nbecomes less predictable. However, with further investigations, we found data\nheterogeneity is more of a curse than a redemption as the attack effectiveness\ncan be significantly boosted by simply adjusting the client-side backdooring\ntiming. More importantly,data heterogeneity may result in overfitting at the\nlocal training of benign clients, which can be utilized by attackers to\ndisguise themselves and fool skewed-feature based defenses. In addition,\neffective attack strategies can be made by adjusting attack data distribution.\nFinally, we discuss the potential directions of defending the curses brought by\ndata heterogeneity. The results and lessons learned from our extensive\nexperiments and analysis offer new insights for designing robust federated\nlearning methods and systems",

      "abstract": "To improve the quality of underwater images, various kinds of underwater\nimage enhancement (UIE) operators have been proposed during the past few years.\nHowever, the lack of effective objective evaluation methods limits the further\ndevelopment of UIE techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel rank learning\nguided no-reference quality assessment method for UIE. Our approach, termed\nTwice Mixing, is motivated by the observation that a mid-quality image can be\ngenerated by mixing a high-quality image with its low-quality version. Typical\nmixup algorithms linearly interpolate a given pair of input data. However, the\nhuman visual system is non-uniformity and non-linear in processing images.\nTherefore, instead of directly training a deep neural network based on the\nmixed images and their absolute scores calculated by linear combinations, we\npropose to train a Siamese Network to learn their quality rankings. Twice\nMixing is trained based on an elaborately formulated self-supervision\nmechanism. Specifically, before each iteration, we randomly generate two mixing\nratios which will be employed for both generating virtual images and guiding\nthe network training. In the test phase, a single branch of the network is\nextracted to predict the quality rankings of different UIE outputs. We conduct\nextensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach outperforms the previous methods\nsignificantly.",

      "abstract": "In the face recognition application scenario, we need to process facial\nimages captured in various conditions, such as at night by near-infrared (NIR)\nsurveillance cameras. The illumination difference between NIR and visible-light\n(VIS) causes a domain gap between facial images, and the variations in pose and\nemotion also make facial matching more difficult. Heterogeneous face\nrecognition (HFR) has difficulties in domain discrepancy, and many studies have\nfocused on extracting domain-invariant features, such as facial part relational\ninformation. However, when pose variation occurs, the facial component position\nchanges, and a different part relation is extracted. In this paper, we propose\na part relation attention module that crops facial parts obtained through a\nsemantic mask and performs relational modeling using each of these\nrepresentative features. Furthermore, we suggest component adaptive triplet\nloss function using adaptive weights for each part to reduce the intra-class\nidentity regardless of the domain as well as pose. Finally, our method exhibits\na performance improvement in the CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0 and achieves superior result\nin the BUAA-VisNir with large pose and emotion variations.",

One is\n$M_{\\epsilon}=O(1)$ and $M_{\\epsilon}=O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$, where $\\epsilon$\nis the interface thickness. We have observed that the velocity and the\ntemperature of the compressible immiscible two-phase fluids continuously\nthrough the interface. There is a jump for the tension tensor at the interface,\nthis jump depends on the surface tension and the mean curvature of the\ninterface. In particular, for the first case $M_{\\epsilon}=O(1)$, no matter how\nthe density changes through the interface, the velocity of the interface in the\nnormal direction is the same as the normal velocity of the fluid along the\ninterface. But for the second case $M_{\\epsilon}=O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$, This\nphenomenon cann't occur where the density passes continuously through the\ninterface.In fact, on this part of the interface, the normal velocity of the\ninterface is determined by the mean curvature of the interface, the velocity\nand the density of the compressible immiscible two-phase fluids. That's where\nthe phase transition happens.",

      "abstract": "In the context of cluster analysis and graph partitioning, many external\nevaluation measures have been proposed in the literature to compare two\npartitions of the same set. This makes the task of selecting the most\nappropriate measure for a given situation a challenge for the end user.\nHowever, this issue is overlooked in the literature. Researchers tend to follow\ntradition and use the standard measures of their field, although they often\nbecame standard only because previous researchers started consistently using\nthem. In this work, we propose a new empirical evaluation framework to solve\nthis issue, and help the end user selecting an appropriate measure for their\napplication. For a collection of candidate measures, it first consists in\ndescribing their behavior by computing them for a generated dataset of\npartitions, obtained by applying a set of predefined parametric partition\ntransformations. Second, our framework performs a regression analysis to\ncharacterize the measures in terms of how they are affected by these parameters\nand transformations. This allows both describing and comparing the measures.\nOur approach is not tied to any specific measure or application, so it can be\napplied to any situation. We illustrate its relevance by applying it to a\nselection of standard measures, and show how it can be put in practice through\ntwo concrete use cases.",

      "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims at learning a good policy from a\nbatch of collected data, without extra interactions with the environment during\ntraining. However, current offline RL benchmarks commonly have a large reality\ngap, because they involve large datasets collected by highly exploratory\npolicies, and the trained policy is directly evaluated in the environment. In\nreal-world situations, running a highly exploratory policy is prohibited to\nensure system safety, the data is commonly very limited, and a trained policy\nshould be well validated before deployment. In this paper, we present a near\nreal-world offline RL benchmark, named NeoRL, which contains datasets from\nvarious domains with controlled sizes, and extra test datasets for policy\nvalidation. We evaluate existing offline RL algorithms on NeoRL and argue that\nthe performance of a policy should also be compared with the deterministic\nversion of the behavior policy, instead of the dataset reward. The empirical\nresults demonstrate that the tested offline RL algorithms become less\ncompetitive to the deterministic policy on many datasets, and the offline\npolicy evaluation hardly helps. The NeoRL suit can be found at\nhttp://polixir.ai/research/neorl. We hope this work will shed some light on\nfuture research and draw more attention when deploying RL in real-world\nsystems.",

      "abstract": "On February 6, 2016 at 21:07:19 UT, a very bright fireball was seen over the\neastern part of Denmark. The weather was cloudy over eastern Denmark, but many\npeople saw the sky light up-even in the heavily illuminated Copenhagen. Two\nhundred and thirty three reports of the associated sound and light phenomena\nwere received by the Danish fireball network. We have formed a consortium to\ndescribe the meteorite and the circumstances of the fall and the results are\npresented in this paper. The first fragment of the meteorite was found the day\nafter the fall, and in the following weeks, a total of 11 fragments with a\ntotal weight of 8982 g were found. The meteorite is an unbrecciated, weakly\nshocked (S2), ordinary H chondrite of petrologic type 5/6 (Bouvier et al.\n2017). The concentration of the cosmogenic radionuclides suggests that the\npreatmospheric radius was rather small ~20 cm. The cosmic ray exposure age of\nEjby (83 +/- 11 Ma) is the highest of an H chondrite and the second highest age\nfor an ordinary chondrite. Using the preatmospheric orbit of the Ejby meteoroid\n(Spurny et al. 2017) locations of the recovered fragments, and wind data from\nthe date of the fall, we have modeled the dark flight (below 18 km) of the\nfragments. The recovery location of the largest fragment can only be explained\nif aerodynamic effects during the dark flight phase are included. The recovery\nlocation of all other fragments are consistent with the dark flight modeling.",

      "abstract": "Quantification of information content and its temporal variation in\nintracellular calcium spike trains in neurons helps one understand functions\nsuch as memory, learning, and cognition. Such quantification could also reveal\npathological signaling perturbation that potentially leads to devastating\nneurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and\nHuntington's diseases. Accordingly, estimation of entropy rate, an\ninformation-theoretic measure of information content, assumes primary\nsignificance. However, such estimation in the present context is challenging\nbecause, while entropy rate is traditionally defined asymptotically for long\nblocks under the assumption of stationarity, neurons are known to encode\ninformation in short intervals and the associated spike trains often exhibit\nnonstationarity. Against this backdrop, we propose an entropy rate estimator\nbased on empirical probabilities that operates within windows, short enough to\nensure approximate stationarity. Specifically, our estimator, parameterized by\nthe length of encoding contexts, attempts to model the underlying memory\nstructures in neuronal spike trains. In an example Markov process, we compared\nthe performance of the proposed method with that of versions of the Lempel-Ziv\nalgorithm as well as with that of a certain stationary distribution method and\nfound the former to exhibit higher accuracy levels and faster convergence.\nAlso, in experimentally recorded calcium responses of four hippocampal neurons,\nthe proposed method showed faster convergence. Significantly, our technique\ndetected structural heterogeneity in the underlying process memory in the\nresponses of the aforementioned neurons. We believe that the proposed method\nfacilitates large-scale studies of such heterogeneity, which could in turn\nidentify signatures of various diseases in terms of entropy rate estimates.",

      "abstract": "The friction f is the property of wall-bounded flows that sets the pumping\ncost of a pipeline, the draining capacity of a river, and other variables of\npractical relevance. For highly turbulent rough-walled pipe flows, f depends\nsolely on the roughness length scale r, and the f -- r relation may be\nexpressed by the Strickler empirical scaling f $\\propto$ r$^{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\nHere, we show experimentally that for soap film flows that are the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) equivalent of highly turbulent rough-walled pipe flows, f\n$\\propto$ r and the f -- r relation is not the same in 2D as in 3D. Our\nfindings are beyond the purview of the standard theory of friction but\nconsistent with a competing theory in which f is linked to the turbulent\nspectrum via the spectral exponent $\\alpha$: In 3D, $\\alpha$ = 5/3 and the\ntheory yields f $\\propto$ r$^{\\frac{1}{3}}$; in 2D, $\\alpha$ = 3 and the theory\nyields f $\\propto$ r.",

To\naccomplish this purpose, we define MAHFs as the product of two components,\nrespectively related to a suitable smoothing function, namely the heat kernel\nderived from the heat diffusion equations, and to local directional\ninformation. We analyse the effectiveness of our approach in multi-scale\nfiltering and variation extraction.

      "abstract": "Non-parallel text style transfer has attracted increasing research interests\nin recent years. Despite successes in transferring the style based on the\nencoder-decoder framework, current approaches still lack the ability to\npreserve the content and even logic of original sentences, mainly due to the\nlarge unconstrained model space or too simplified assumptions on latent\nembedding space. Since language itself is an intelligent product of humans with\ncertain grammars and has a limited rule-based model space by its nature,\nrelieving this problem requires reconciling the model capacity of deep neural\nnetworks with the intrinsic model constraints from human linguistic rules. To\nthis end, we propose a method called Graph Transformer based Auto Encoder\n(GTAE), which models a sentence as a linguistic graph and performs feature\nextraction and style transfer at the graph level, to maximally retain the\ncontent and the linguistic structure of original sentences. Quantitative\nexperiment results on three non-parallel text style transfer tasks show that\nour model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in content preservation, while\nachieving comparable performance on transfer accuracy and sentence naturalness.",

In view of this scenario, a crash detection and collision\navoidance algorithm coined as Midvehicle Collision Detection and Avoidance\nSystem (MCDAS) is proposed to evade the possible crash at both ends of the host\nvehicle. The method based upon Constant Velocity (CV) model specifically,\naddresses two scenarios, the first scenario encompasses two sub-scenario\nnamely, a) A rear-end collision avoidance mechanism that accelerates the host\nvehicle under no front-end vehicle condition and b) Curvilinear motion based on\nfront and host vehicle offset (position), whilst, the other scenario deals with\nparallel parking issues. The offset based curvilinear motion of the host\nvehicle plays a vital role in threat avoidance from the front-end vehicle. A\ndesired curvilinear strategy on left and right sides is achieved by the host\nvehicle with concern of possible CV to avoid both end collisions. In this\nmethodology, path constraint is applicable for both scenarios with required\ndirection.

      "abstract": "In real-world complex networks, understanding the dynamics of their evolution\nhas been of great interest to the scientific community. Predicting future links\nis an essential task of social network analysis as the addition or removal of\nthe links over time leads to the network evolution. In a network, links can be\ncategorized as intra-community links if both end nodes of the link belong to\nthe same community, otherwise inter-community links. The existing\nlink-prediction methods have mainly focused on achieving high accuracy for\nintra-community link prediction. In this work, we propose a network embedding\nmethod, called NodeSim, which captures both similarities between the nodes and\nthe community structure while learning the low-dimensional representation of\nthe network. The embedding is learned using the proposed NodeSim random walk,\nwhich efficiently explores the diverse neighborhood while keeping the more\nsimilar nodes closer in the context of the node. We verify the efficacy of the\nproposed embedding method over state-of-the-art methods using diverse link\nprediction. We propose a machine learning model for link prediction that\nconsiders both the nodes' embedding and their community information to predict\nthe link between two given nodes. Extensive experimental results on several\nreal-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for\nboth inter and intra-community link prediction.",

The intrinsic properties of carbon and\ntungsten target nuclei have been described in terms of their spectral\nfunctions, which take into account the momenta of target protons and the\nenergies of their separation from the considered nuclei.

      "abstract": "Point defects in real crystals at finite temperatures are inevitable. Their\ndynamics severely influence the mechanical properties of crystals under shear\ngiving rise to nonlinear effects such as ductility. Therefore, it is crucial to\nexplore the interplay of the equilibrium point-defect diffusion timescales and\nshear-induced timescales to understand the plastic deformation of crystals.\nUsing extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we present a\nstudy on the yielding behavior of cluster crystals (CC), an archetypal model\nfor defect-rich crystals where the crystalline structure is characterized by\nmultiple occupancies (cluster) of particles at a lattice site. In equilibrium,\nparticles diffuse via site-to-site hopping keeping the crystalline structure\nintact. We consider the CCs at a fixed density and different temperatures where\nit remains in the FCC structure, and the diffusion timescales of particles vary\ndepending on the temperature. We choose the range of shear rates, which covers\ntimescales higher and much lower than the equilibrium diffusion timescales at\nhigh temperatures. For the considered range of shear rates and temperatures,\nboth the macro and microscopic responses of CCs to the shear suggest that the\nyielding scenario remains independent of the diffusion of particles. It\ninvolves the plastic deformation of the underlying crystalline structure. The\naveraged local bond order parameters and local angle measurements demonstrate\nthe structural changes and cooperative movement of the center of masses of the\nclusters close to the yield point. A comparison with the soft-sphere (SS) FCC\ncrystal reveals the similarities in the yielding behavior of both systems.\nNonetheless, diffusion of particles influences certain features, such as a less\nprominent increase in the local bond order parameters and local angles close to\nthe yield point.",

      "title": "Few-shot Image Classification with Multi-Facet Prototypes",
      "abstract": "The aim of few-shot learning (FSL) is to learn how to recognize image\ncategories from a small number of training examples. A central challenge is\nthat the available training examples are normally insufficient to determine\nwhich visual features are most characteristic of the considered categories. To\naddress this challenge, we organize these visual features into facets, which\nintuitively group features of the same kind (e.g. features that are relevant to\nshape, color, or texture). This is motivated from the assumption that (i) the\nimportance of each facet differs from category to category and (ii) it is\npossible to predict facet importance from a pre-trained embedding of the\ncategory names. In particular, we propose an adaptive similarity measure,\nrelying on predicted facet importance weights for a given set of categories.\nThis measure can be used in combination with a wide array of existing\nmetric-based methods. Experiments on miniImageNet and CUB show that our\napproach improves the state-of-the-art in metric-based FSL.",

      "abstract": "Ceramics are easy to break, and very few generic mechanisms are available for\nimproving their mechanical properties, e.g., the 1975-discovered anti-fracture\nmechanism is strictly limited to zirconia and hafnia. Here we report a general\nmechanism for achieving high plasticity through liquefaction of ceramics. We\nfurther disclose the general material design strategies to achieve this\ndifficult task through entropy-boosted amorphous ceramics (EBACs), enabling\nfracture-resistant properties that can withstand severe plastic deformation\n(e.g., over 95%, deformed to a thickness of a few nanometers) while maintaining\nhigh hardness and reduced modulus. The findings reported here open a new route\nto ductile ceramics and many applications.",

      "abstract": "LiteBIRD is a JAXA-led Strategic Large-Class mission designed to search for\nthe existence of the primordial gravitational waves produced during the\ninflationary phase of the Universe, through the measurements of their imprint\nonto the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These\nmeasurements, requiring unprecedented sensitivity, will be performed over the\nfull sky, at large angular scales, and over 15 frequency bands from 34GHz to\n448GHz. The LiteBIRD instruments consist of three telescopes, namely the Low-,\nMedium- and High-Frequency Telescope (respectively LFT, MFT and HFT). We\npresent in this paper an overview of the design of the Medium-Frequency\nTelescope (89-224GHz) and the High-Frequency Telescope (166-448GHz), the\nso-called MHFT, under European responsibility, which are two cryogenic\nrefractive telescopes cooled down to 5K. They include a continuous rotating\nhalf-wave plate as the first optical element, two high-density polyethylene\n(HDPE) lenses and more than three thousand transition-edge sensor (TES)\ndetectors cooled to 100mK. We provide an overview of the concept design and the\nremaining specific challenges that we have to face in order to achieve the\nscientific goals of LiteBIRD.",

      "abstract": "Microcalcifications are small deposits of calcium that appear in mammograms\nas bright white specks on the soft tissue background of the breast.\nMicrocalcifications may be a unique indication for Ductal Carcinoma in Situ\nbreast cancer, and therefore their accurate detection is crucial for diagnosis\nand screening. Manual detection of these tiny calcium residues in mammograms is\nboth time-consuming and error-prone, even for expert radiologists, since these\nmicrocalcifications are small and can be easily missed. Existing computerized\nalgorithms for detecting and segmenting microcalcifications tend to suffer from\na high false-positive rate, hindering their widespread use. In this paper, we\npropose an accurate calcification segmentation method using deep learning. We\nspecifically address the challenge of keeping the false positive rate low by\nsuggesting a strategy for focusing the hard pixels in the training phase.\nFurthermore, our accurate segmentation enables extracting meaningful statistics\non clusters of microcalcifications.",

      "title": "Choosing the Variable Ordering for Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition\n  via Exploiting Chordal Structure",
      "abstract": "Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) plays an important role in the\nfield of real algebraic geometry and many other areas. As is well-known, the\nchoice of variable ordering while computing CAD has a great effect on the time\nand memory use of the computation as well as the number of sample points\ncomputed. In this paper, we indicate that typical CAD algorithms, if executed\nwith respect to a special kind of variable orderings (called \"the perfect\nelimination orderings\"), naturally preserve chordality, which is an important\nproperty on sparsity of variables. Experimentation suggests that if the\nassociated graph of the polynomial system in question is chordal (\\emph{resp.},\nis nearly chordal), then a perfect elimination ordering of the associated graph\n(\\emph{resp.}, of a minimal chordal completion of the associated graph) can be\na good variable ordering for the CAD computation. That is, by using the perfect\nelimination orderings, the CAD computation may produce a much smaller full set\nof projection polynomials than by using other naive variable orderings. More\nimportantly, for the complexity analysis of the CAD computation via a perfect\nelimination ordering, a so-called $(m,d)$-property of the full set of\nprojection polynomials obtained via such an ordering is given, through which\nthe \"size\" of this set is characterized. This property indicates that when the\ncorresponding perfect elimination tree has a lower height, the full set of\nprojection polynomials also tends to have a smaller \"size\". This is well\nconsistent with the experimental results, hence the perfect elimination\norderings with lower elimination tree height are further recommended to be used\nin the CAD projection.",

      "abstract": "As a popular Q&A site for programming, Stack Overflow is a treasure for\ndevelopers. However, the amount of questions and answers on Stack Overflow make\nit difficult for developers to efficiently locate the information they are\nlooking for. There are two gaps leading to poor search results: the gap between\nthe user's intention and the textual query, and the semantic gap between the\nquery and the post content. Therefore, developers have to constantly\nreformulate their queries by correcting misspelled words, adding limitations to\ncertain programming languages or platforms, etc. As query reformulation is\ntedious for developers, especially for novices, we propose an automated\nsoftware-specific query reformulation approach based on deep learning. With\nquery logs provided by Stack Overflow, we construct a large-scale query\nreformulation corpus, including the original queries and corresponding\nreformulated ones. Our approach trains a Transformer model that can\nautomatically generate candidate reformulated queries when given the user's\noriginal query. The evaluation results show that our approach outperforms five\nstate-of-the-art baselines, and achieves a 5.6% to 33.5% boost in terms of\n$\\mathit{ExactMatch}$ and a 4.8% to 14.4% boost in terms of $\\mathit{GLEU}$.",

      "abstract": "Sentic computing relies on well-defined affective models of different\ncomplexity - polarity to distinguish positive and negative sentiment, for\nexample, or more nuanced models to capture expressions of human emotions. When\nused to measure communication success, even the most granular affective model\ncombined with sophisticated machine learning approaches may not fully capture\nan organisation's strategic positioning goals. Such goals often deviate from\nthe assumptions of standardised affective models. While certain emotions such\nas Joy and Trust typically represent desirable brand associations, specific\ncommunication goals formulated by marketing professionals often go beyond such\nstandard dimensions. For instance, the brand manager of a television show may\nconsider fear or sadness to be desired emotions for its audience. This article\nintroduces expansion techniques for affective models, combining common and\ncommonsense knowledge available in knowledge graphs with language models and\naffective reasoning, improving coverage and consistency as well as supporting\ndomain-specific interpretations of emotions. An extensive evaluation compares\nthe performance of different expansion techniques: (i) a quantitative\nevaluation based on the revisited Hourglass of Emotions model to assess\nperformance on complex models that cover multiple affective categories, using\nmanually compiled gold standard data, and (ii) a qualitative evaluation of a\ndomain-specific affective model for television programme brands. The results of\nthese evaluations demonstrate that the introduced techniques support a variety\nof embeddings and pre-trained models.

      "abstract": "This paper considers a video caption generating network referred to as\nSemantic Grouping Network (SGN) that attempts (1) to group video frames with\ndiscriminating word phrases of partially decoded caption and then (2) to decode\nthose semantically aligned groups in predicting the next word. As consecutive\nframes are not likely to provide unique information, prior methods have focused\non discarding or merging repetitive information based only on the input video.\nThe SGN learns an algorithm to capture the most discriminating word phrases of\nthe partially decoded caption and a mapping that associates each phrase to the\nrelevant video frames - establishing this mapping allows semantically related\nframes to be clustered, which reduces redundancy. In contrast to the prior\nmethods, the continuous feedback from decoded words enables the SGN to\ndynamically update the video representation that adapts to the partially\ndecoded caption. Furthermore, a contrastive attention loss is proposed to\nfacilitate accurate alignment between a word phrase and video frames without\nmanual annotations. The SGN achieves state-of-the-art performances by\noutperforming runner-up methods by a margin of 2.1%p and 2.4%p in a CIDEr-D\nscore on MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets, respectively.

The rogue nodes in VANETs broadcast malicious\ninformation leading to potential hazards, including the collision of vehicles.\nPrevious researchers used either cryptography, trust values, or past vehicle\ndata to detect rogue nodes, but they suffer from high processing delay,\noverhead, and false-positive rate (FPR). We propose fog-based rogue nodes\ndetection (F-RouND), a fog computing scheme, which dynamically creates a fog\nutilizing the on-board units (OBUs) of all vehicles in the region for rogue\nnodes detection. The novelty of F-RouND lies in providing low processing delays\nand FPR at high vehicle densities. The performance of our F-RouND framework was\ncarried out with simulations using OMNET++ and SUMO simulators. Results show\nthat F-RouND ensures 45% lower processing delays, 12% lower overhead, and 36%\nlower FPR at high vehicle densities compared to existing rogue nodes detection\nschemes.",

      "title": "Rapid sorting of radio galaxy morphology using Haralick features",
      "abstract": "We demonstrate the use of Haralick features for the automated classification\nof radio galaxies. The set of thirteen Haralick features represent an extremely\ncompact non-parametric representation of image texture, and are calculated\ndirectly from imagery using the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The\nGLCM is an encoding of the relationship between the intensity of neighbouring\npixels in an image. Using 10,000 sources detected in the first data release of\nthe LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), we demonstrate that Haralick features\nare highly efficient, rotationally invariant descriptors of radio galaxy\nmorphology. After calculating Haralick features for LoTSS sources, we employ\nthe fast density-based hierarchical clustering algorithm HDBSCAN to group radio\nsources into a sequence of morphological classes, illustrating a simple\nmethodology to classify and label new, unseen galaxies in large samples. By\nadopting a 'soft' clustering approach, we can assign each galaxy a probability\nof belonging to a given cluster, allowing for more flexibility in the selection\nof galaxies according to combinations of morphological characteristics and for\neasily identifying outliers: those objects with a low probability of belonging\nto any cluster in the Haralick space. Although our demonstration focuses on\nradio galaxies, Haralick features can be calculated for any image, making this\napproach also relevant to large optical imaging galaxy surveys.",

      "abstract": "In theory, a major advantage to the big data approach in studying online\ncommunities is that it should be possible to collect a representative random\nsample from a broadly defined population. However, in practice, data collection\nprocesses are not formalized, even for famous social media platforms such as\nTwitter and Facebook. As a result, there is ambiguity left on questions such as\n\"how much data is enough?\" and how representative are the samples of the\nbroader population being studied in online social networks. In this paper, I\npropose a focused back-and-forth crawl approach and a validated seed choice\nmethod for collecting network-level data from Twitter. The proposed crawl\nmethod can extract community structures without needing a complete network\ngraph for the Twitter network and validate its size using \"reference score\". It\nalso takes care of the sampling size problem in Twitter by tracking the\npercentage of known nodes that have been included in the data. Thus, solving\nmost major problems in Twitter data collection procedures and moving a step\nfurther to formalizing data collection methods for the platform. Once the\ncommunities are crawled, and the network graph is clean and complete; it is\nthen possible to train Machine Learning classifiers using communities as\nfeatures to predict political affiliations of users on a larger scale. As a\ncase, I used the proposed method for separating French political communities on\nTwitter from the global Twitter community and knowing the political\naffiliations of users on a continuous scale.",

However, these systems are\ncomputationally expensive since they require pre-training followed by\nfine-tuning in a large parameter space. We explore the performance of such\nsystems without fine-tuning by training a state-of-the-art speech recognizer on\nthe fixed representations from the computationally demanding wav2vec 2.0\nframework. We find performance to decrease without fine-tuning and, in the\nextreme low-resource setting, wav2vec 2.0 is inferior to its predecessor. In\naddition, we find that wav2vec 2.0 representations live in a low dimensional\nsubspace and that decorrelating the features of the representations can\nstabilize training of the automatic speech recognizer. Finally, we propose a\nbidirectional extension to the original wav2vec framework that consistently\nimproves performance.",

However, these methods\nentangle geometry and appearance in a \"black-box\" volume that cannot be edited.\nInstead, we present an approach that explicitly disentangles\ngeometry--represented as a continuous 3D volume--from appearance--represented\nas a continuous 2D texture map. We achieve this by introducing a 3D-to-2D\ntexture mapping (or surface parameterization) network into volumetric\nrepresentations. We constrain this texture mapping network using an additional\n2D-to-3D inverse mapping network and a novel cycle consistency loss to make 3D\nsurface points map to 2D texture points that map back to the original 3D\npoints. We demonstrate that this representation can be reconstructed using only\nmulti-view image supervision and generates high-quality rendering results. More\nimportantly, by separating geometry and texture, we allow users to edit\nappearance by simply editing 2D texture maps.",

We analyze a commercial Edge TPU using 24 Google edge NN models\n(including CNNs, LSTMs, transducers, and RCNNs), and find that the accelerator\nsuffers from three shortcomings, in terms of computational throughput, energy\nefficiency, and memory access handling. We comprehensively study the\ncharacteristics of each NN layer in all of the Google edge models, and find\nthat these shortcomings arise from the one-size-fits-all approach of the\naccelerator, as there is a high amount of heterogeneity in key layer\ncharacteristics both across different models and across different layers in the\nsame model.\n  We propose a new acceleration framework called Mensa. Mensa incorporates\nmultiple heterogeneous ML edge accelerators (including both on-chip and\nnear-data accelerators), each of which caters to the characteristics of a\nparticular subset of models. At runtime, Mensa schedules each layer to run on\nthe best-suited accelerator, accounting for both efficiency and inter-layer\ndependencies. As we analyze the Google edge NN models, we discover that all of\nthe layers naturally group into a small number of clusters, which allows us to\ndesign an efficient implementation of Mensa for these models with only three\nspecialized accelerators. Averaged across all 24 Google edge models, Mensa\nimproves energy efficiency and throughput by 3.0x and 3.1x over the Edge TPU,\nand by 2.4x and 4.3x over Eyeriss v2, a state-of-the-art accelerator.",

      "abstract": "Motion completion is a challenging and long-discussed problem, which is of\ngreat significance in film and game applications. For different motion\ncompletion scenarios (in-betweening, in-filling, and blending), most previous\nmethods deal with the completion problems with case-by-case designs. In this\nwork, we propose a simple but effective method to solve multiple motion\ncompletion problems under a unified framework and achieves a new state of the\nart accuracy under multiple evaluation settings. Inspired by the recent great\nsuccess of attention-based models, we consider the completion as a sequence to\nsequence prediction problem. Our method consists of two modules - a standard\ntransformer encoder with self-attention that learns long-range dependencies of\ninput motions, and a trainable mixture embedding module that models temporal\ninformation and discriminates key-frames. Our method can run in a\nnon-autoregressive manner and predict multiple missing frames within a single\nforward propagation in real time. We finally show the effectiveness of our\nmethod in music-dance applications.",

      "abstract": "Permissioned blockchains employ Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state machine\nreplication (SMR) to reach agreement on an ever-growing, linearly ordered log\nof transactions. A new paradigm, combined with decades of research in BFT SMR\nand blockchain (namely chained-BFT, or cBFT), has emerged for directly\nconstructing blockchain protocols. Chained-BFT protocols have a unifying\npropose-vote scheme instead of multiple different voting phases with a set of\nvoting and commit rules to guarantee safety and liveness. However, distinct\nvoting and commit rules impose varying impacts on performance under different\nworkloads, network conditions, and Byzantine attacks. Therefore, a fair\ncomparison of the proposed protocols poses a challenge that has not yet been\naddressed by existing work.\n  We fill this gap by studying a family of cBFT protocols with a two-pronged\nsystematic approach. First, we present an evaluation framework, Bamboo, for\nquick prototyping of cBFT protocols and that includes helpful benchmarking\nfacilities. To validate Bamboo, we introduce an analytic model using queuing\ntheory which also offers a back-of-the-envelope guide for dissecting these\nprotocols. We build multiple cBFT protocols using Bamboo and we are the first\nto fairly compare three representatives (i.e., HotStuff, two-chain HotStuff,\nand Streamlet). We evaluated these protocols under various parameters and\nscenarios, including two Byzantine attacks that have not been widely discussed\nin the literature. Our findings reveal interesting trade-offs (e.g.,\nresponsiveness vs. forking-resilience) between different cBFT protocols and\ntheir design choices, which provide developers and researchers with insights\ninto the design and implementation of this protocol family.",

      "abstract": "Image guided depth completion is the task of generating a dense depth map\nfrom a sparse depth map and a high quality image. In this task, how to fuse the\ncolor and depth modalities plays an important role in achieving good\nperformance. This paper proposes a two-branch backbone that consists of a\ncolor-dominant branch and a depth-dominant branch to exploit and fuse two\nmodalities thoroughly. More specifically, one branch inputs a color image and a\nsparse depth map to predict a dense depth map. The other branch takes as inputs\nthe sparse depth map and the previously predicted depth map, and outputs a\ndense depth map as well. The depth maps predicted from two branches are\ncomplimentary to each other and therefore they are adaptively fused. In\naddition, we also propose a simple geometric convolutional layer to encode 3D\ngeometric cues. The geometric encoded backbone conducts the fusion of different\nmodalities at multiple stages, leading to good depth completion results. We\nfurther implement a dilated and accelerated CSPN++ to refine the fused depth\nmap efficiently. The proposed full model ranks 1st in the KITTI depth\ncompletion online leaderboard at the time of submission. It also infers much\nfaster than most of the top ranked methods.

Point cloud registration with ICP is less accurate when the number of\npoints is reduced because ICP basically minimizes the distance between points.\nTo avoid this problem, symmetric KL-divergence is introduced to the ICP cost\nthat reflects the difference between two probabilistic distributions.

To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised paradigm to learn\nMulti-View Transformation Equivariant Representations (MV-TER), exploring the\nequivariant transformations of a 3D object and its projected multiple views.\nSpecifically, we perform a 3D transformation on a 3D object, and obtain\nmultiple views before and after the transformation via projection. Then, we\nself-train a representation to capture the intrinsic 3D object representation\nby decoding 3D transformation parameters from the fused feature representations\nof multiple views before and after the transformation. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed MV-TER significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art view-based approaches in 3D object classification and\nretrieval tasks, and show the generalization to real-world datasets.",

      "abstract": "One of the greatest contributors of the 20th century among all academician in\nthe field of statistical finance, M. F. M. Osborne published in 1956 [6] an\nessential paper and proposed to treat the question of stock market motion\nthrough the prism of both the Law of Weber-Fechner [1, 4] and the branch of\nphysics developed by James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann and Josiah Willard\nGibbs [3, 5] namely the statistical mechanics. He proposed an improvement of\nthe known research made by his predecessor Louis Jean-Baptiste Alphonse\nBachelier, by not considering the arithmetic changes of stock prices as means\nof statistical measurement, but by drawing on the Weber-Fechner Law, to treat\nthe changes of prices. Osborne emphasized that as in statistical mechanics, the\nprobability distribution of the steady-state of subjective change in prices is\ndetermined by the condition of maximum probability, a statement close to the\nGibbs distribution conditions. However, Osborne also admitted that the\nempirical observation of the probability distribution of logarithmic changes of\nstock prices was emphasizing obvious asymmetries and consequently could not\nperfectly confirm his prior theory. The purpose of this paper is to propose an\nexplanation to what we could call the Osborne paradox and then address an\nalternative approach via Bayesian inference regarding the description of the\nprobability distribution of changes in logarithms of prices that was\nthenceforth under the prism of frequentist inference. We show that the stock\nmarket returns are locally described by equilibrium statistical mechanics with\nconserved statistics variables, whereas globally there is yet other statistics\nwith persistent flowing variables that can be effectively described by a\nsuperposition of several statistics on different time scales, namely, a\nsuperstatistics.",

      "abstract": "Entity alignment (EA) is the task to discover entities referring to the same\nreal-world object from different knowledge graphs (KGs), which is the most\ncrucial step in integrating multi-source KGs. The majority of the existing\nembeddings-based entity alignment methods embed entities and relations into a\nvector space based on relation triples of KGs for local alignment. As these\nmethods insufficiently consider the multiple relations between entities, the\nstructure information of KGs has not been fully leveraged. In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework based on Relation-aware Graph Attention Networks to\ncapture the interactions between entities and relations. Our framework adopts\nthe self-attention mechanism to spread entity information to the relations and\nthen aggregate relation information back to entities. Furthermore, we propose a\nglobal alignment algorithm to make one-to-one entity alignments with a\nfine-grained similarity matrix. Experiments on three real-world cross-lingual\ndatasets show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Modeling real-world phenomena is a focus of many science and engineering\nefforts, such as ecological modeling and financial forecasting, to name a few.\nBuilding an accurate model for complex and dynamic systems improves\nunderstanding of underlying processes and leads to resource efficiency. Towards\nthis goal, knowledge-driven modeling builds a model based on human expertise,\nyet is often suboptimal. At the opposite extreme, data-driven modeling learns a\nmodel directly from data, requiring extensive data and potentially generating\noverfitting. We focus on an intermediate approach, model revision, in which\nprior knowledge and data are combined to achieve the best of both worlds. In\nthis paper, we propose a genetic model revision framework based on\ntree-adjoining grammar (TAG) guided genetic programming (GP), using the TAG\nformalism and GP operators in an effective mechanism to incorporate prior\nknowledge and make data-driven revisions in a way that complies with prior\nknowledge. Our framework is designed to address the high computational cost of\nevolutionary modeling of complex systems. Via a case study on the challenging\nproblem of river water quality modeling, we show that the framework efficiently\nlearns an interpretable model, with higher modeling accuracy than existing\nmethods.",

These hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) database\nsystems can support real-time data analysis without the high costs of\nsynchronizing across separate single-purpose databases. Unfortunately, for many\napplications that perform a high rate of data updates, state-of-the-art HTAP\nsystems incur significant drops in transactional (up to 74.6%) and/or\nanalytical (up to 49.8%) throughput compared to performing only transactions or\nonly analytics in isolation, due to (1) data movement between the CPU and\nmemory, (2) data update propagation, and (3) consistency costs.\n  We propose Polynesia, a hardware-software co-designed system for in-memory\nHTAP databases. Polynesia (1) divides the HTAP system into transactional and\nanalytical processing islands, (2) implements custom algorithms and hardware to\nreduce the costs of update propagation and consistency, and (3) exploits\nprocessing-in-memory for the analytical islands to alleviate data movement.

To improve\ntheir correctness, the industry has been applying blackbox fuzzing for decades.\nRecently, the research community achieved impressive fuzzing gains using\ncoverage guidance. However, due to the complexity and distributed nature of\nenterprise-level DBMSs, seldom are these researches applied to the industry.\n  In this paper, we apply coverage-guided fuzzing to enterprise-level DBMSs\nfrom Huawei and Bloomberg LP. In our practice of testing GaussDB and Comdb2, we\nfound major challenges in all three testing stages. The challenges are\ncollecting precise coverage, optimizing fuzzing performance, and analyzing root\ncauses. In search of a general method to overcome these challenges, we propose\nRatel, a coverage-guided fuzzer for enterprise-level DBMSs. With its\nindustry-oriented design, Ratel improves the feedback precision, enhances the\nrobustness of input generation, and performs an on-line investigation on the\nroot cause of bugs. As a result, Ratel outperformed other fuzzers in terms of\ncoverage and bugs. Compared to industrial black box fuzzers SQLsmith and\nSQLancer, as well as coverage-guided academic fuzzer Squirrel, Ratel covered\n38.38%, 106.14%, 583.05% more basic blocks than the best results of other three\nfuzzers in GaussDB, PostgreSQL, and Comdb2, respectively.

      "abstract": "Security inspection is X-ray scanning for personal belongings in suitcases,\nwhich is significantly important for the public security but highly\ntime-consuming for human inspectors. Fortunately, deep learning has greatly\npromoted the development of computer vision, offering a possible way of\nautomatic security inspection. However, items within a luggage are randomly\noverlapped resulting in noisy X-ray images with heavy occlusions. Thus,\ntraditional CNN-based models trained through common image recognition datasets\nfail to achieve satisfactory performance in this scenario. To address these\nproblems, we contribute the first high-quality prohibited X-ray object\ndetection dataset named OPIXray, which contains 8885 X-ray images from 5\ncategories of the widely-occurred prohibited item ``cutters''. The images are\ngathered from an airport and these prohibited items are annotated manually by\nprofessional inspectors, which can be used as a benchmark for model training\nand further facilitate future research. To better improve occluded X-ray object\ndetection, we further propose an over-sampling de-occlusion attention network\n(DOAM-O), which consists of a novel de-occlusion attention module and a new\nover-sampling training strategy. Specifically, our de-occlusion module, namely\nDOAM, simultaneously leverages the different appearance information of the\nprohibited items; the over-sampling training strategy forces the model to put\nmore emphasis on these hard samples consisting these items of high occlusion\nlevels, which is more suitable for this scenario. We comprehensively evaluated\nDOAM-O on the OPIXray dataset, which proves that our model can stably improve\nthe performance of the famous detection models such as SSD, YOLOv3, and FCOS,\nand outperform many extensively-used attention mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Siamese trackers have recently achieved interesting results due to their\nbalance between accuracy and speed. This success is mainly due to the fact that\ndeep similarity networks were specifically designed to address the image\nsimilarity problem. Therefore, they are inherently more appropriate than\nclassical CNNs for the tracking task. However, Siamese trackers rely on the\nlast convolutional layers for similarity analysis and target search, which\nrestricts their performance. In this paper, we argue that using a single\nconvolutional layer as feature representation is not the optimal choice within\nthe deep similarity framework, as multiple convolutional layers provide several\nabstraction levels in characterizing an object. Starting from this motivation,\nwe present the Multi-Features Siamese Tracker (MFST), a novel tracking\nalgorithm exploiting several hierarchical feature maps for robust deep\nsimilarity tracking. MFST proceeds by fusing hierarchical features to ensure a\nricher and more efficient representation. Moreover, we handle appearance\nvariation by calibrating deep features extracted from two different CNN models.\nBased on this advanced feature representation, our algorithm achieves high\ntracking accuracy, while outperforming several state-of-the-art trackers,\nincluding standard Siamese trackers.

      "abstract": "To extract robust deep representations from long sequential modeling of\nspeech data, we propose a self-supervised learning approach, namely Contrastive\nSeparative Coding (CSC). Our key finding is to learn such representations by\nseparating the target signal from contrastive interfering signals. First, a\nmulti-task separative encoder is built to extract shared separable and\ndiscriminative embedding; secondly, we propose a powerful cross-attention\nmechanism performed over speaker representations across various interfering\nconditions, allowing the model to focus on and globally aggregate the most\ncritical information to answer the \"query\" (current bottom-up embedding) while\npaying less attention to interfering, noisy, or irrelevant parts; lastly, we\nform a new probabilistic contrastive loss which estimates and maximizes the\nmutual information between the representations and the global speaker vector.\nWhile most prior unsupervised methods have focused on predicting the future,\nneighboring, or missing samples, we take a different perspective of predicting\nthe interfered samples. Moreover, our contrastive separative loss is free from\nnegative sampling. The experiment demonstrates that our approach can learn\nuseful representations achieving a strong speaker verification performance in\nadverse conditions.",

From the view of\nsoftware engineering, AI techniques can be seen in many fundamental aspects of\ndevelopment, such as source code comprehension, in which state-of-the-art\nmodels are implemented to extract and express the meaning of code snippets\nautomatically. However, such technologies are still struggling to tackle and\ncomprehend the complex structures within industrial code, thus far from\nreal-world applications. In the present work, we built an innovative and\nsystematical framework, emphasizing the problem of complexity in code\ncomprehension and further software engineering. Upon automatic data collection\nfrom the latest Linux kernel source code, we modeled code structures as complex\nnetworks through token extraction and relation parsing. Comprehensive analysis\nof complexity further revealed the density and scale of network-based code\nrepresentations. Our work constructed the first large-scale dataset from\nindustrial-strength software code for downstream software engineering tasks\nincluding code comprehension, and incorporated complex network theory into\ncode-level investigations of software development for the first time. In the\nlonger term, the proposed methodology could play significant roles in the\nentire software engineering process, powering software design, coding,\ndebugging, testing, and sustaining by redefining and embracing complexity.",

The proposed RSMA-GrCIM scheme transmits information to\nmultiple user equipments (UEs) through the space division multiple access\n(SDMA) technique, and exploits code index modulation for rate splitting. Since\nthe CIM scheme conveys information bits via the index of the selected Walsh\ncode and binary phase shift keying (BPSK) signal, our RSMA scheme transmits the\nprivate messages of each user through the indices, and the common messages via\nthe BPSK signal. Moreover, the Walsh code set is grouped into several\northogonal subsets to eliminate the interference from other users. A maximum\nlikelihood (ML) detector is used to recovery the source bits, and a\nmathematical analysis is provided for the upper bound bit error ratio (BER) of\neach user.

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a self-supervised low light image enhancement method\nbased on deep learning, which can improve the image contrast and reduce noise\nat the same time to avoid the blur caused by pre-/post-denoising. The method\ncontains two deep sub-networks, an Image Contrast Enhancement Network (ICE-Net)\nand a Re-Enhancement and Denoising Network (RED-Net). The ICE-Net takes the low\nlight image as input and produces a contrast enhanced image. The RED-Net takes\nthe result of ICE-Net and the low light image as input, and can re-enhance the\nlow light image and denoise at the same time. Both of the networks can be\ntrained with low light images only, which is achieved by a Maximum Entropy\nbased Retinex (ME-Retinex) model and an assumption that noises are\nindependently distributed. In the ME-Retinex model, a new constraint on the\nreflectance image is introduced that the maximum channel of the reflectance\nimage conforms to the maximum channel of the low light image and its entropy\nshould be the largest, which converts the decomposition of reflectance and\nillumination in Retinex model to a non-ill-conditioned problem and allows the\nICE-Net to be trained with a self-supervised way. The loss functions of RED-Net\nare carefully formulated to separate the noises and details during training,\nand they are based on the idea that, if noises are independently distributed,\nafter the processing of smoothing filters (\\eg mean filter), the gradient of\nthe noise part should be smaller than the gradient of the detail part. It can\nbe proved qualitatively and quantitatively through experiments that the\nproposed method is efficient.",

At inference time, thresholds are applied on the confidence scores\noutputted by a probabilistic classifier, in order to decide which classes are\ndetected active. In this work, we consider having at disposal a trained\nclassifier and we seek to automatically optimize the decision thresholds\naccording to a performance metric of interest, in our case F-measure\n(micro-F1). We propose a new method, called SGL-Thresh for Surrogate Gradient\nLearning of Thresholds, that makes use of gradient descent. Since F1 is not\ndifferentiable, we propose to approximate the thresholding operation gradients\nwith the gradients of a sigmoid function. We report experiments on three\ndatasets, using state-of-the-art pre-trained deep neural networks. In all\ncases, SGL-Thresh outperformed three other approaches: a default threshold\nvalue (defThresh), an heuristic search algorithm and a method estimating F1\ngradients numerically. It reached 54.9\\% F1 on AudioSet eval, compared to 50.7%\nwith defThresh. SGL-Thresh is very fast and scalable to a large number of tags.\nTo facilitate reproducibility, data and source code in Pytorch are available\nonline: https://github.com/topel/SGL-Thresh",

      "abstract": "National statistical institutes currently investigate how to improve the\noutput quality of official statistics based on machine learning algorithms. A\nkey obstacle is concept drift, i.e., when the joint distribution of independent\nvariables and a dependent (categorical) variable changes over time. Under\nconcept drift, a statistical model requires regular updating to prevent it from\nbecoming biased. However, updating a model asks for additional data, which are\nnot always available. In the literature, we find a variety of bias correction\nmethods as a promising solution. In the paper, we will compare two popular\ncorrection methods: the misclassification estimator and the calibration\nestimator. For prior probability shift (a specific type of concept drift), we\ninvestigate the two correction methods theoretically as well as experimentally.\nOur theoretical results are expressions for the bias and variance of both\nmethods. As experimental result, we present a decision boundary (as a function\nof (a) model accuracy, (b) class distribution and (c) test set size) for the\nrelative performance of the two methods. Close inspection of the results will\nprovide a deep insight into the effect of prior probability shift on output\nquality, leading to practical recommendations on the use of machine learning\nalgorithms in official statistics.",

      "abstract": "Recently, significant advancements have been made in face recognition\ntechnologies using Deep Neural Networks. As a result, companies such as\nMicrosoft, Amazon, and Naver offer highly accurate commercial face recognition\nweb services for diverse applications to meet the end-user needs. Naturally,\nhowever, such technologies are threatened persistently, as virtually any\nindividual can quickly implement impersonation attacks. In particular, these\nattacks can be a significant threat for authentication and identification\nservices, which heavily rely on their underlying face recognition technologies'\naccuracy and robustness. Despite its gravity, the issue regarding deepfake\nabuse using commercial web APIs and their robustness has not yet been\nthoroughly investigated. This work provides a measurement study on the\nrobustness of black-box commercial face recognition APIs against Deepfake\nImpersonation (DI) attacks using celebrity recognition APIs as an example case\nstudy. We use five deepfake datasets, two of which are created by us and\nplanned to be released. More specifically, we measure attack performance based\non two scenarios (targeted and non-targeted) and further analyze the differing\nsystem behaviors using fidelity, confidence, and similarity metrics.\nAccordingly, we demonstrate how vulnerable face recognition technologies from\npopular companies are to DI attack, achieving maximum success rates of 78.0%\nand 99.9% for targeted (i.e., precise match) and non-targeted (i.e., match with\nany celebrity) attacks, respectively. Moreover, we propose practical defense\nstrategies to mitigate DI attacks, reducing the attack success rates to as low\nas 0% and 0.02% for targeted and non-targeted attacks, respectively.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method, Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation\n(Zero-DCE), which formulates light enhancement as a task of image-specific\ncurve estimation with a deep network. Our method trains a lightweight deep\nnetwork, DCE-Net, to estimate pixel-wise and high-order curves for dynamic\nrange adjustment of a given image. The curve estimation is specially designed,\nconsidering pixel value range, monotonicity, and differentiability. Zero-DCE is\nappealing in its relaxed assumption on reference images, i.e., it does not\nrequire any paired or even unpaired data during training. This is achieved\nthrough a set of carefully formulated non-reference loss functions, which\nimplicitly measure the enhancement quality and drive the learning of the\nnetwork. Despite its simplicity, we show that it generalizes well to diverse\nlighting conditions. Our method is efficient as image enhancement can be\nachieved by an intuitive and simple nonlinear curve mapping. We further present\nan accelerated and light version of Zero-DCE, called Zero-DCE++, that takes\nadvantage of a tiny network with just 10K parameters. Zero-DCE++ has a fast\ninference speed (1000/11 FPS on a single GPU/CPU for an image of size\n1200*900*3) while keeping the enhancement performance of Zero-DCE. Extensive\nexperiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of our method over\nstate-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, the\npotential benefits of our method to face detection in the dark are discussed.\nThe source code will be made publicly available at\nhttps://li-chongyi.github.io/Proj_Zero-DCE++.html.",

      "abstract": "Fuzzing is a technique widely used in vulnerability detection. The process\nusually involves writing effective fuzz driver programs, which, when done\nmanually, can be extremely labor intensive. Previous attempts at automation\nleave much to be desired, in either degree of automation or quality of output.\nIn this paper, we propose IntelliGen, a framework that constructs valid fuzz\ndrivers automatically. First, IntelliGen determines a set of entry functions\nand evaluates their respective chance of exhibiting a vulnerability. Then,\nIntelliGen generates fuzz drivers for the entry functions through hierarchical\nparameter replacement and type inference. We implemented IntelliGen and\nevaluated its effectiveness on real-world programs selected from the Android\nOpen-Source Project, Google's fuzzer-test-suite and industrial collaborators.\nIntelliGen covered on average 1.08X-2.03X more basic blocks and 1.36X-2.06X\nmore paths over state-of-the-art fuzz driver synthesizers FUDGE and FuzzGen.\nIntelliGen performed on par with manually written drivers and found 10 more\nbugs.",

Even though the general\nquestion continues to remain open, we make some progress towards its\nresolution. To that effect, we generalise the notion of ordered polynomials in\nthe non-commutative setting (defined by \\Hrubes, Wigderson and Yehudayoff\n(2011)) to define abecedarian polynomials and models that naturally compute\nthem.\n  Our main contribution is a possible new approach towards separating formulas\nand ABPs in the non-commutative setting, via lower bounds against abecedarian\nformulas. In particular, we show the following.\n  There is an explicit n-variate degree d abecedarian polynomial $f_{n,d}(x)$\nsuch that 1. $f_{n, d}(x)$ can be computed by an abecedarian ABP of size O(nd);\n2. any abecedarian formula computing $f_{n, \\log n}(x)$ must have size that is\nsuper-polynomial in n.\n  We also show that a super-polynomial lower bound against abecedarian formulas\nfor $f_{\\log n, n}(x)$ would separate the powers of formulas and ABPs in the\nnon-commutative setting.",

Since conventional channel estimation and decision\nfeedback equalizer (DFE) can not work well for this type of channel, a\npath-specific underwater acoustic channel tracking is proposed. It is based on\nthe framework of Kalman filter. We provide a simplified sound propagation model\nas the state transition model. A multipath tracker is proposed which is\ntolerant of the model-mismatch. Then we can obtain the time-variant path number\nand path-specific parameters such as delay and Doppler scaling factor. We also\nconsider the application of the proposed path-specific underwater acoustic\nchannel tracking. We propose two types of passive time reversal mirror (PTRM)\nwith our path-specific parameters for time-variant and doubly-spread underwater\nacoustic channel. With the path-specific parameters obtained by the proposed\nchannel tracking, the proposed PTRM can not only match the time dispersion as\nconventional PTRM, but also the doubly-spread channel, since the path-specific\ndelay and Doppler scaler factor can help to match the channel in both time and\nfrequency domain. For extensive doubly-spread channel, we can further apply the\npath-specific compensation to the PTRM.

      "abstract": "We present a novel counterfactual framework for both Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL)\nand Open-Set Recognition (OSR), whose common challenge is generalizing to the\nunseen-classes by only training on the seen-classes. Our idea stems from the\nobservation that the generated samples for unseen-classes are often out of the\ntrue distribution, which causes severe recognition rate imbalance between the\nseen-class (high) and unseen-class (low). We show that the key reason is that\nthe generation is not Counterfactual Faithful, and thus we propose a faithful\none, whose generation is from the sample-specific counterfactual question: What\nwould the sample look like, if we set its class attribute to a certain class,\nwhile keeping its sample attribute unchanged? Thanks to the faithfulness, we\ncan apply the Consistency Rule to perform unseen/seen binary classification, by\nasking: Would its counterfactual still look like itself? If ``yes'', the sample\nis from a certain class, and ``no'' otherwise. Through extensive experiments on\nZSL and OSR, we demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates the\nseen/unseen imbalance and hence significantly improves the overall performance.\nNote that this framework is orthogonal to existing methods, thus, it can serve\nas a new baseline to evaluate how ZSL/OSR models generalize.

The SCF improves the feature representation of\nsteganalysis by maximizing the distance between features of samples of\ndifferent categories and minimizing the distance between features of samples of\nthe same category. To decrease the computing complexity of the contrastive loss\nin supervised learning, we design a novel Steganalysis Contrastive Loss\n(StegCL) based on the equivalence and transitivity of similarity. The StegCL\neliminates the redundant computing in the existing contrastive loss. The\nexperimental results show that the SCF improves the generalization and\ndetection accuracy of existing steganalysis DNNs, and the maximum promotion is\n2% and 3% respectively. Without decreasing the detection accuracy, the training\ntime of using the StegCL is 10% of that of using the contrastive loss in\nsupervised learning.",

However, this approach falls\nshort in many real-world scenarios, where the true labels are not readily\navailable to compute the loss. In this context, there is increasing attention\nto approaches that perform concept drift detection in an unsupervised manner,\ni.e., without access to the true labels. We propose a novel approach to\nunsupervised concept drift detection based on a student-teacher learning\nparadigm. Essentially, we create an auxiliary model (student) to mimic the\nbehaviour of the primary model (teacher). At run-time, our approach is to use\nthe teacher for predicting new instances and monitoring the mimicking loss of\nthe student for concept drift detection.

Accurate modelling of the pressure strain correlation\nleads to proper prediction of turbulence stresses and subsequently the other\nterms of engineering interest.

Machine learning based\nmodels have shown promise in turbulence modeling but their application has been\nlargely restricted to eddy viscosity based models.

The input features of the\nneural networks are chosen using physics based rationale. The networks are\ntrained with the high resolution DNS data of turbulent channel flow at\ndifferent friction Reynolds numbers.

      "abstract": "Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) has been proposed to transfer knowledge\nlearned from a label-rich source domain to a label-scarce target domain without\nany constraints on the label sets. In practice, however, it is difficult to\nobtain a large amount of perfectly clean labeled data in a source domain with\nlimited resources. Existing UniDA methods rely on source samples with correct\nannotations, which greatly limits their application in the real world. Hence,\nwe consider a new realistic setting called Noisy UniDA, in which classifiers\nare trained with noisy labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data\nwith an unknown class distribution from the target domain. This paper\nintroduces a two-head convolutional neural network framework to solve all\nproblems simultaneously. Our network consists of one common feature generator\nand two classifiers with different decision boundaries. By optimizing the\ndivergence between the two classifiers' outputs, we can detect noisy source\nsamples, find \"unknown\" classes in the target domain, and align the\ndistribution of the source and target domains. In an extensive evaluation of\ndifferent domain adaptation settings, the proposed method outperformed existing\nmethods by a large margin in most settings.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of predicting the future motion of a\ndynamic agent (called a target agent) given its current and past states as well\nas the information on its environment. It is paramount to develop a prediction\nmodel that can exploit the contextual information in both static and dynamic\nenvironments surrounding the target agent and generate diverse trajectory\nsamples that are meaningful in a traffic context. We propose a novel prediction\nmodel, referred to as the lane-aware prediction (LaPred) network, which uses\nthe instance-level lane entities extracted from a semantic map to predict the\nmulti-modal future trajectories. For each lane candidate found in the\nneighborhood of the target agent, LaPred extracts the joint features relating\nthe lane and the trajectories of the neighboring agents. Then, the features for\nall lane candidates are fused with the attention weights learned through a\nself-supervised learning task that identifies the lane candidate likely to be\nfollowed by the target agent. Using the instance-level lane information, LaPred\ncan produce the trajectories compliant with the surroundings better than 2D\nraster image-based methods and generate the diverse future trajectories given\nmultiple lane candidates. The experiments conducted on the public nuScenes\ndataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that the proposed LaPred method\nsignificantly outperforms the existing prediction models, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance in the benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Python has become the de-facto language for training deep neural networks,\ncoupling a large suite of scientific computing libraries with efficient\nlibraries for tensor computation such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. However, when\nmodels are used for inference they are typically extracted from Python as\nTensorFlow graphs or TorchScript programs in order to meet performance and\npackaging constraints. The extraction process can be time consuming, impeding\nfast prototyping. We show how it is possible to meet these performance and\npackaging constraints while performing inference in Python. In particular, we\npresent a way of using multiple Python interpreters within a single process to\nachieve scalable inference and describe a new container format for models that\ncontains both native Python code and data. This approach simplifies the model\ndeployment story by eliminating the model extraction step, and makes it easier\nto integrate existing performance-enhancing Python libraries. We evaluate our\ndesign on a suite of popular PyTorch models on Github, showing how they can be\npackaged in our inference format, and comparing their performance to\nTorchScript. For larger models, our packaged Python models perform the same as\nTorchScript, and for smaller models where there is some Python overhead, our\nmulti-interpreter approach ensures inference is still scalable.",

      "abstract": "In their everyday life, the speech recognition performance of human listeners\nis influenced by diverse factors, such as the acoustic environment, the talker\nand listener positions, possibly impaired hearing, and optional hearing\ndevices. Prediction models come closer to considering all required factors\nsimultaneously to predict the individual speech recognition performance in\ncomplex acoustic environments. While such predictions may still not be\nsufficiently accurate for serious applications, they can already be performed\nand demand an accessible representation. In this contribution, an interactive\nrepresentation of speech recognition performance is proposed, which focuses on\nthe listeners head orientation and the spatial dimensions of an acoustic scene.\nA exemplary modeling toolchain, including an acoustic rendering model, a\nhearing device model, and a listener model, was used to generate a data set for\ndemonstration purposes. Using the spatial speech recognition maps to explore\nthis data set demonstrated the suitability of the approach to observe possibly\nrelevant behavior. The proposed representation provides a suitable target to\ncompare and validate different modeling approaches in ecologically relevant\ncontexts. Eventually, it may serve as a tool to use validated prediction models\nin the design of spaces and devices which take speech communication into\naccount.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the supervised learning paradigm's surprisingly remarkable\nperformance has garnered considerable attention from Sanskrit Computational\nLinguists. As a result, the Sanskrit community has put laudable efforts to\nbuild task-specific labeled data for various downstream Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tasks. The primary component of these approaches comes from\nrepresentations of word embeddings. Word embedding helps to transfer knowledge\nlearned from readily available unlabelled data for improving task-specific\nperformance in low-resource setting. Last decade, there has been much\nexcitement in the field of digitization of Sanskrit. To effectively use such\nreadily available resources, it is very much essential to perform a systematic\nstudy on word embedding approaches for the Sanskrit language. In this work, we\ninvestigate the effectiveness of word embeddings. We classify word embeddings\nin broad categories to facilitate systematic experimentation and evaluate them\non four intrinsic tasks. We investigate the efficacy of embeddings approaches\n(originally proposed for languages other than Sanskrit) for Sanskrit along with\nvarious challenges posed by language.",

GSE members are selected\nto have eccentricity ($e$) $>$ 0.7 and [Fe/H] $<$ -1.0, and separated into low\nand high orbital-inclination (LOI/HOI) groups. We find that the LOI stars\nmainly have $e < 0.9$ and are clearly separable into two groups with prograde\nand retrograde motions. The LOI stars exhibit prograde motions in the\ninner-halo region and strong retrograde motions in the outer-halo region. We\ninterpret the LOI stars in these regions to be stars accreted from two massive\ndwarf galaxies with low-inclination prograde and retrograde orbits, affected to\ndifferent extents by dynamical friction due to their different orbital\ndirections. In contrast, the majority of the HOI stars have $e > 0.9$, and\nexhibit a globally symmetric distribution of rotational velocities ($V_{\\rm\n\\phi}$) near zero, although there is evidence for a small retrograde motion for\nthese stars ($V_{\\rm \\phi}$ $\\sim$ -15 $\\rm{km~s^{-1}}$) in the outer-halo\nregion. We consider these stars to be stripped from a massive dwarf galaxy on a\nhigh-inclination orbit. We also find that the LOI and HOI stars on highly\neccentric and tangential orbits with clear retrograde motions exhibit different\nmetallicity peaks at [Fe/H] = -1.7 and -1.9, respectively, and argue that they\nare associated with two low-mass dwarf galaxies accreted in the outer-halo\nregion of the Galaxy.",

      "abstract": "Fluid transport networks are important in many natural settings and\nengineering applications, from animal cardiovascular and respiratory systems to\nplant vasculature to plumbing networks and chemical plants. Understanding how\nnetwork topology, connectivity, internal boundaries and other geometrical\naspects affect the global flow state is a challenging problem that depends on\ncomplex fluid properties characterized by different length and time scales. The\nstudy of flow in micro-scale networks focuses on low Reynolds numbers where\nsmall volumes of fluids move at slow speeds. The flow physics at these scales\nis governed by the Stokes equation, which is linear. This linearity property\nallows for relatively simple theoretical and computational solutions that\ngreatly aid in the understanding, modeling and designing of micro-scale\nnetworks.\n  At larger scales and faster flow rates, macrofluidic networks are also\nimportant but the flow physics is quite different. The underlying Navier-Stokes\nequation is nonlinear, theoretical results are few, simulations are\nchallenging, and the mapping between geometry and desired flow objectives are\nall much more complex. The phenomenology for such high-Reynolds-number or\ninertially-dominated flows is well documented and well-studied: Flows are\nretarded in thin boundary layers near solid surfaces; such flows are sensitive\nto geometry and tend to separate from surfaces; and vortices, wakes, jets and\nunsteadiness abound. The counter-intuitive nature of inertial flows is\nexemplified by the breakdown of reversibility. This dissertation explores two\ngeneral ways of how rectified flows emerge in macrofluidic networks as a\nconsequence of irreversibility and unsteady effects: When branches or channels\nof a network have asymmetric internal geometry and the second when a network\ncontains loops.",

In this work, several classes of problems are considered. For each\nclass, reliable and efficient polytope, n-cube, and n-ball inner approximations\nare presented. The interval approaches usually proposed are inefficient because\nthey are too computationally heavy for certain applications, such as control.\nWe propose efficient new inner approximation theorems for the considered\nclasses of problems.

In\nthis paper we develop a custom, parallelizable algorithm for solving the\nresource allocation problem that scales to large problems, with millions of\njobs. Our algorithm is based on the dual problem, in which the dual variables\nassociated with the resource usage limit can be interpreted as resource prices.\nOur method updates the resource prices in each iteration, ultimately\ndiscovering the optimal resource prices, from which an optimal allocation is\nobtained. We provide an open-source implementation of our method, which can\nsolve problems with millions of jobs in a few seconds on CPU, and under a\nsecond on a GPU; our software can solve smaller problems in milliseconds. On\nlarge problems, our implementation is up to three orders of magnitude faster\nthan a commerical solver for convex optimization.",

This two-stage training process inevitably raises questions about the\ngeneralization ability of the pre-trained model, which is particularly\npronounced when a salient domain gap exists between source and target data\n(e.g., instructional cooking videos vs. movies). In this paper, we first bring\nto light the sensitivity of pre-training objectives (contrastive vs.\nreconstructive) to domain discrepancy. Then, we propose a simple yet effective\nframework, CUPID, to bridge this domain gap by filtering and adapting source\ndata to the target data, followed by domain-focused pre-training. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that pre-training on a considerably small subset of\ndomain-focused data can effectively close the source-target domain gap and\nachieve significant performance gain, compared to random sampling or even\nexploiting the full pre-training dataset. CUPID yields new state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple video-language and video tasks, including\ntext-to-video retrieval [72, 37], video question answering [36], and video\ncaptioning [72], with consistent performance lift over different pre-training\nmethods.",

      "abstract": "We consider the asymptotic behaviour of small-amplitude gravity water waves\nin a rectangular domain where the water depth is much smaller than the\nhorizontal scale. The control acts on one lateral boundary, by imposing the\nhorizontal acceleration of the water along that boundary, as a scalar input\nfunction u. The state z of the system consists of two functions: the water\nlevel $\\zeta$ along the top boundary, and its time derivative $\\partial$$\\zeta$\n$\\partial$t. We prove that the solution of the water waves system converges to\nthe solution of the one dimensional wave equation with Neumann boundary\ncontrol, when taking the shallowness limit. Our approach is based on a special\nchange of variables and a scattering semigroup, which provide the possiblity to\napply the Trotter-Kato approximation theorem.

      "abstract": "Tracking segmentation masks of multiple instances has been intensively\nstudied, but still faces two fundamental challenges: 1) the requirement of\nlarge-scale, frame-wise annotation, and 2) the complexity of two-stage\napproaches. To resolve these challenges, we introduce a novel semi-supervised\nframework by learning instance tracking networks with only a labeled image\ndataset and unlabeled video sequences. With an instance contrastive objective,\nwe learn an embedding to discriminate each instance from the others. We show\nthat even when only trained with images, the learned feature representation is\nrobust to instance appearance variations, and is thus able to track objects\nsteadily across frames. We further enhance the tracking capability of the\nembedding by learning correspondence from unlabeled videos in a self-supervised\nmanner. In addition, we integrate this module into single-stage instance\nsegmentation and pose estimation frameworks, which significantly reduce the\ncomputational complexity of tracking compared to two-stage networks. We conduct\nexperiments on the YouTube-VIS and PoseTrack datasets. Without any video\nannotation efforts, our proposed method can achieve comparable or even better\nperformance than most fully-supervised methods.",

In contrast to\nthe case of surfaces of topologically finite type, the Teichm{\\\"u}ller spaces\nassociated to surfaces of topologically infinite type depend on the choice of a\nbase structure. In the setting of surfaces of infinite type, the\nTeichm{\\\"u}ller spaces can be endowed with different distance functions such as\nthe length-spectrum distance, the bi-Lipschitz distance, the Fenchel-Nielsen\ndistance, the Teichm{\\\"u}ller distance and there are other distance functions.\nUnlike the case of surfaces of topologically finite type, these distance\nfunctions are not equivalent. We introduce the finitely supported\nTeichm{\\\"u}ller space T f s H 0 associated to a base hyperbolic structure H 0\non a surface $\\Sigma$, provide its characterization by Fenchel-Nielsen\ncoordinates and study its relation to the other Teichm{\\\"u}ller spaces.

We show that T f s H 0 is dense in T 0 ls H 0 , where both\nspaces are considered to be subspaces of the length-spectrum Teichm{\\\"u}ller\nspace T ls H 0. Another result we present here is that asymptotically\nlength-spectrum bounded Teichm{\\\"u}ller space A T ls H 0 is contractible.

      "abstract": "Catalysts are substances that assist transformation of other resourceful\nobjects without being consumed in the process. However, the fact that their\n`catalytic power' is limited and can be depleted is often overlooked,\nespecially in the recently developing theories on catalysis of quantum\nrandomness utilizing building correlation with catalyst. In this work, we\nestablish a resource theory of one-shot catalytic randomness in which\nuncorrelatedness is consumed in catalysis of randomness. We do so by completely\ncharacterizing bipartite unitary operators that can be used to implement\ncatalysis of randomness using partial transpose. By doing so, we find that\nevery catalytic channel is factorizable, and therefore there exists a unital\nchannel that is not catalytic. We define a family of catalytic entropies that\nquantifies catalytically extractable entropy within a quantum state and show\nhow much degeneracy of quantum state can boost the catalytic entropy beyond its\nordinary entropy. Based on this, we demonstrate that a randomness source can be\nactually exhausted after a certain amount of randomness is extracted. We apply\nthis theory to systems under conservation law that forbids superposition of\ncertain quantum states and find that non-maximally mixed states can yield the\nmaximal catalytic entropy. We discuss implications of this theory to various\ntopics including catalytic randomness absorption, the no-secret theorem and the\npossibility of multi-party infinite catalysis.",

      "abstract": "The recent rapid increase in demand for data processing has resulted in the\nneed for novel machine learning concepts and hardware. Physical reservoir\ncomputing and an extreme learning machine are novel computing paradigms based\non physical systems themselves, where the high dimensionality and nonlinearity\nplay a crucial role in the information processing. Herein, we propose the use\nof multidimensional speckle dynamics in multimode fibers for information\nprocessing, where input information is mapped into the space, frequency, and\ntime domains by an optical phase modulation technique. The speckle-based\nmapping of the input information is high-dimensional and nonlinear and can be\nrealized at the speed of light; thus, nonlinear time-dependent information\nprocessing can successfully be achieved at fast rates when applying a\nreservoir-computing-like-approach. As a proof-of-concept, we experimentally\ndemonstrate chaotic time-series prediction at input rates of 12.5 Gigasamples\nper second. Moreover, we show that owing to the passivity of multimode fibers,\nmultiple tasks can be simultaneously processed within a single system, i.e.,\nmultitasking. These results offer a novel approach toward realizing parallel,\nhigh-speed, and large-scale photonic computing.",

However, it is labor-intensive to annotate the correlations between the\nsignals sampled from the audio and visual modalities, thus making it difficult\nto supervise the learning of a machine for this task. In this work, we propose\nan iterative contrastive learning framework that requires no data annotations.\nAt each iteration, the proposed method takes the 1) localization results in\nimages predicted in the previous iteration, and 2) semantic relationships\ninferred from the audio signals as the pseudo-labels. We then use the\npseudo-labels to learn the correlation between the visual and audio signals\nsampled from the same video (intra-frame sampling) as well as the association\nbetween those extracted across videos (inter-frame relation). Our iterative\nstrategy gradually encourages the localization of the sounding objects and\nreduces the correlation between the non-sounding regions and the reference\naudio. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed framework performs favorably against existing unsupervised and\nweakly-supervised methods on the sound localization task.",

In\nstandard medical education, students' communication skills are trained with\nrole-playing and Standardized Patients (SPs), i.e., actors.

The objective of this work is to survey the recent literature,\nassessing the state of the art of this technology with a specific focus on the\ninstructional and technical design of VP simulations.

While most of early methods are focused on unsupervised DA\n(UDA), several studies on semi-supervised DA (SSDA) are recently suggested. In\nSSDA, a small number of labeled target images are given for training, and the\neffectiveness of those data is demonstrated by the previous studies.

Existing trackers with template updating\nmechanisms rely on time-consuming numerical optimization and complex\nhand-designed strategies to achieve competitive performance, hindering them\nfrom real-time tracking and practical applications.

      "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as an attractive decentralized\nsolution for wireless networks to collaboratively train a shared model while\nkeeping data localized. As a general approach, existing FL methods tend to\nassume perfect knowledge of the Channel State Information (CSI) during the\ntraining phase, which may not be easy to acquire in case of fast fading\nchannels. Moreover, literature analyses either consider a fixed number of\nclients participating in the training of the federated model, or simply assume\nthat all clients operate at the maximum achievable rate to transmit model data.\nIn this paper, we fill these gaps by proposing a training process that takes\nchannel statistics as a bias to minimize the convergence time under imperfect\nCSI. Numerical experiments demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the\ntraining time by neglecting model updates from clients that cannot sustain a\nminimum predefined transmission rate. We also examine the trade-off between\nnumber of clients involved in the training process and model accuracy as a\nfunction of different fading regimes.",

      "abstract": "Vision-and-language pre-training has achieved impressive success in learning\nmultimodal representations between vision and language. To generalize this\nsuccess to non-English languages, we introduce UC2, the first machine\ntranslation-augmented framework for cross-lingual cross-modal representation\nlearning. To tackle the scarcity problem of multilingual captions for image\ndatasets, we first augment existing English-only datasets with other languages\nvia machine translation (MT). Then we extend the standard Masked Language\nModeling and Image-Text Matching training objectives to multilingual setting,\nwhere alignment between different languages is captured through shared visual\ncontext (i.e, using image as pivot). To facilitate the learning of a joint\nembedding space of images and all languages of interest, we further propose two\nnovel pre-training tasks, namely Masked Region-to-Token Modeling (MRTM) and\nVisual Translation Language Modeling (VTLM), leveraging MT-enhanced translated\ndata. Evaluation on multilingual image-text retrieval and multilingual visual\nquestion answering benchmarks demonstrates that our proposed framework achieves\nnew state-of-the-art on diverse non-English benchmarks while maintaining\ncomparable performance to monolingual pre-trained models on English tasks.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the theory of rectifiability in arbitrary Carnot\ngroups, and in particular with the study of the notion of\n$\\mathscr{P}$-rectifiable measure.\n  First, we show that in arbitrary Carnot groups the natural\n\\textit{infinitesimal} definition of rectifiabile measure, i.e., the definition\ngiven in terms of the existence of \\textit{flat} tangent measures, is\nequivalent to the global definition given in terms of coverings with\nintrinsically differentiable graphs, i.e., graphs with \\textit{flat} Hausdorff\ntangents. In general we do not have the latter equivalence if we ask the\ncovering to be made of intrinsically Lipschitz graphs.\n  Second, we show a geometric area formula for the centered Hausdorff measure\nrestricted to intrinsically differentiable graphs in arbitrary Carnot groups.\nThe latter formula extends and strengthens other area formulae obtained in the\nliterature in the context of Carnot groups.\n  As an application, our analysis allows us to prove the intrinsic\n$C^1$-rectifiability of almost all the preimages of a large class of Lipschitz\nfunctions between Carnot groups. In particular, from the latter result, we\nobtain that any geodesic sphere in a Carnot group equipped with an arbitrary\nleft-invariant homogeneous distance is intrinsic $C^1$-rectifiable.",

We develop an optimization-based approach that exploits mirror\nsymmetry constraints for accurate 3D pose reconstruction. We also provide a\nmethod to estimate the surface normal of the mirror from vanishing points in\nthe single image. To validate the proposed approach, we collect a large-scale\ndataset named Mirrored-Human, which covers a large variety of human subjects,\nposes and backgrounds. The experiments demonstrate that, when trained on\nMirrored-Human with our reconstructed 3D poses as pseudo ground-truth, the\naccuracy and generalizability of existing single-view 3D pose estimators can be\nlargely improved.",

      "abstract": "Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification using Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN) is widely found in the current literature. Approaches vary from using\nSVMs to 2D CNNs, 3D CNNs, 3D-2D CNNs. Besides 3D-2D CNNs and FuSENet, the other\napproaches do not consider both the spectral and spatial features together for\nHSI classification task, thereby resulting in poor performances. 3D CNNs are\ncomputationally heavy and are not widely used, while 2D CNNs do not consider\nmulti-resolution processing of images, and only limits itself to the spatial\nfeatures. Even though 3D-2D CNNs try to model the spectral and spatial features\ntheir performance seems limited when applied over multiple dataset. In this\narticle, we propose SpectralNET, a wavelet CNN, which is a variation of 2D CNN\nfor multi-resolution HSI classification. A wavelet CNN uses layers of wavelet\ntransform to bring out spectral features. Computing a wavelet transform is\nlighter than computing 3D CNN. The spectral features extracted are then\nconnected to the 2D CNN which bring out the spatial features, thereby creating\na spatial-spectral feature vector for classification. Overall a better model is\nachieved that can classify multi-resolution HSI data with high accuracy.\nExperiments performed with SpectralNET on benchmark dataset, i.e. Indian Pines,\nUniversity of Pavia, and Salinas Scenes confirm the superiority of proposed\nSpectralNET with respect to the state-of-the-art methods.

In the symbolic domain, the\nkey problem of automatically arranging a piece music was extensively studied,\nwhile relatively fewer systems tackled this challenge in the audio domain. In\nthis contribution, we propose CycleDRUMS, a novel method for generating drums\ngiven a bass line. After converting the waveform of the bass into a\nmel-spectrogram, we are able to automatically generate original drums that\nfollow the beat, sound credible and can be directly mixed with the input bass.\nWe formulated this task as an unpaired image-to-image translation problem, and\nwe addressed it with CycleGAN, a well-established unsupervised style transfer\nframework, originally designed for treating images. The choice to deploy raw\naudio and mel-spectrograms enabled us to better represent how humans perceive\nmusic, and to potentially draw sounds for new arrangements from the vast\ncollection of music recordings accumulated in the last century. In absence of\nan objective way of evaluating the output of both generative adversarial\nnetworks and music generative systems, we further defined a possible metric for\nthe proposed task, partially based on human (and expert) judgement. Finally, as\na comparison, we replicated our results with Pix2Pix, a paired image-to-image\ntranslation network, and we showed that our approach outperforms it.",

      "abstract": "In this note, we consider a special instance of the scaled, inexact and\nadaptive generalised Fast Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (SAGE-FISTA)\nrecently proposed in (Rebegoldi, Calatroni, '21) for the efficient solution of\nstrongly convex composite optimisation problems. In particular, we address here\nthe sole (non-strongly) convex optimisation scenario, which is frequently\nencountered in many imaging applications. The proposed inexact S-FISTA\nalgorithm shows analogies to the variable metric and inexact version of FISTA\nstudied in (Bonettini, Rebegoldi, Ruggiero, '19), the main difference being the\nuse of an adaptive (non-monotone) backtracking strategy allowing for the\nautomatic adjustment of the algorithmic step-size along the iterations (see\n(Scheinberg, Goldfarb, Bai, '14, Calatroni, Chambolle, '19)). A quadratic\nconvergence result in function values depending on the backtracking parameters\nand the upper and lower bounds on the spectrum of the variable metric operators\nis given. Experimental results on TV image deblurring problems with Poisson\nnoise are then reported for numerical validation, showing improved\ncomputational efficiency and precision.",

      "title": "Exploiting Relationship for Complex-scene Image Generation",
      "abstract": "The significant progress on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has\nfacilitated realistic single-object image generation based on language input.\nHowever, complex-scene generation (with various interactions among multiple\nobjects) still suffers from messy layouts and object distortions, due to\ndiverse configurations in layouts and appearances. Prior methods are mostly\nobject-driven and ignore their inter-relations that play a significant role in\ncomplex-scene images. This work explores relationship-aware complex-scene image\ngeneration, where multiple objects are inter-related as a scene graph. With the\nhelp of relationships, we propose three major updates in the generation\nframework. First, reasonable spatial layouts are inferred by jointly\nconsidering the semantics and relationships among objects. Compared to standard\nlocation regression, we show relative scales and distances serve a more\nreliable target. Second, since the relations between objects significantly\ninfluence an object's appearance, we design a relation-guided generator to\ngenerate objects reflecting their relationships. Third, a novel scene graph\ndiscriminator is proposed to guarantee the consistency between the generated\nimage and the input scene graph. Our method tends to synthesize plausible\nlayouts and objects, respecting the interplay of multiple objects in an image.\nExperimental results on Visual Genome and HICO-DET datasets show that our\nproposed method significantly outperforms prior arts in terms of IS and FID\nmetrics. Based on our user study and visual inspection, our method is more\neffective in generating logical layout and appearance for complex-scenes.",

It can benefit traditional optimization-based solutions to\ninverse problems, but also allows for self-supervision of learning-based\napproaches for which training data with ground truth annotation is hard to\nobtain. However, existing differentiable renderers either do not model\nvisibility of the light sources from the different points in the scene,\nresponsible for shadows in the images, or are too slow for being used to train\ndeep architectures over thousands of iterations. To this end, we propose an\naccurate yet efficient approach for differentiable visibility and soft shadow\ncomputation. Our approach is based on the spherical harmonics approximations of\nthe scene illumination and visibility, where the occluding surface is\napproximated with spheres. This allows for a significantly more efficient\nshadow computation compared to methods based on ray tracing.

The information of the semi-definite programming is allocated to\nmultiple interconnected agents such that each agent aims to find a solution by\ncommunicating to its neighbors. Based on low-rank property of solutions and the\nBurer-Monteiro factorization, we transform the original problem into a\ndistributed optimization problem over unit spheres to reduce variable\ndimensions and ensure positive semi-definiteness without involving\nsemi-definite projections, which are computationally expensive. For the\ndistributed optimization problem, we propose distributed synchronous and\nasynchronous algorithms, both of which reduce computational burden and storage\nspace compared with existing centralized algorithms. Specifically, the\ndistributed synchronous algorithm almost surely escapes strict saddle points\nand converges to the set of optimal solutions to the optimization problem. In\naddition, the proposed distributed asynchronous algorithm allows communication\ndelays and converges to the set of critical points to the optimization problem\nunder mild conditions. By applying proposed algorithms to image segmentation\napplications, we illustrate the efficiency and convergence performance of the\ntwo proposed algorithms.",

Our work's goal is to illustrate the\nessential steps needed to build tensor correlators starting from the scalar\nsolutions, for 3-point functions. In the case of 4-point functions, our\nattention is centred around scalar correlators for which the CWI's are\nsufficient to isolate the unique solution if we enhance the symmetry with the\naddition of a dual conformal symmetry. Dual conformal symmetry in momentum\nspace is obtained once the momentum variables are rewritten in a dual form, as\nthe difference of coordinate-like variables and treated as ordinary correlators\nin such variables, mirroring the action of coordinate space. This enhancement\nof the symmetry is sufficient to fix the solutions also for such correlators.\nThe solution of the conformal constraints are given in terms of triple-$K$\nintegrals and are expressed in terms of a set of constants, specific for each\ncorrelator and spacetime dimension. We present a discussion of the intermediate\nsteps in the description of two nontrivial correlators, the $TTO$ and the\n$TTT$, in a more pedagogical way, offering details that could help extend such\nmethods to higher point function.",

      "abstract": "Predictive business process monitoring is concerned with the prediction how a\nrunning process instance will unfold up to its completion at runtime. Most of\nthe proposed approaches rely on a wide number of different machine learning\n(ML) techniques. In the last years numerous comparative studies, reviews, and\nbenchmarks of such approaches where published and revealed that they can be\nsuccessfully applied for different prediction targets. ML techniques require a\nqualitatively and quantitatively sufficient data set. However, there are many\nsituations in business process management (BPM) where only a quantitatively\ninsufficient data set is available. The problem of insufficient data in the\ncontext of BPM is still neglected. Hence, none of the comparative studies or\nbenchmarks investigates the performance of predictive business process\nmonitoring techniques in environments with small data sets. In this paper an\nevaluation framework for comparing existing approaches with regard to their\nsuitability for small data sets is developed and exemplarily applied to\nstate-of-the-art approaches in predictive business process monitoring.",

To address these issues, we propose to regularize local updates by\nminimizing the divergence of client models. We also formulate the training in\nan adversarial fashion and optimize the client models to produce a\ndiscriminative feature space that can better represent unseen data samples. We\ndemonstrate the intuitions and conduct experiments to show our approaches\noutperform baselines by more than 10% in learning vision tasks and 5% in\nlanguage tasks.",

      "title": "General synthetic iterative scheme for unsteady rarefied gas flows",
      "abstract": "In rarefied gas flows, the spatial grid size could vary by several orders of\nmagnitude in a single flow configuration (e.g., inside the Knudsen layer it is\nat the order of mean free path of gas molecules, while in the bulk region it is\nat a much larger hydrodynamic scale). Therefore, efficient implicit numerical\nmethod is urgently needed for time-dependent problems. However, the\nintegro-differential nature of gas kinetic equations poses a grand challenge,\nas the gain part of the collision operator is non-invertible. Hence an\niterative solver is required in each time step, which usually takes a lot of\niterations in the (near) continuum flow regime where the Knudsen number is\nsmall; worse still, the solution does not asymptotically preserve the fluid\ndynamic limit when the spatial cell size is not refined enough. Inspired by our\ngeneral synthetic iteration scheme for steady-state solution of the Boltzmann\nequation, we propose two numerical schemes to push the multiscale simulation of\nunsteady rarefied gas flows to a new boundary, that is, the numerical solution\nnot only converges within dozens of iterations in each time step, but also\nasymptotic preserves the Navier-Stokes-Fourier limit at coarse spatial grid,\neven when the time step is large (e.g., in the extreme slow decay of\ntwo-dimensional Taylor vortex, the time step is at the order of vortex decay\ntime). The properties of fast convergence and asymptotic preserving of the\nproposed schemes are not only rigorously proven by the Fourier stability\nanalysis, but also demonstrated by solid numerical examples.",

      "abstract": "We revisit a known model in which (conducting) blocks are hierarchically and\nrandomly deposited on a $d$-dimensional substrate according to a hyperbolic\nsize law with the block size decreasing by a factor $\\lambda \\, > 1$ in each\nsubsequent generation. In the first part of the paper the number of coastal\npoints (in $D=1)$ or coastlines (in $D=2)$ is calculated, which are points or\nlines that separate a region at \"sea level\" and an elevated region. We find\nthat this number possesses a non-universal character, implying a Euclidean\ngeometry below a threshold value $P_c$ of the deposition probability $P$, and a\nfractal geometry above this value. Exactly at the threshold, the geometry is\nlogarithmic fractal. The number of coastlines in $D=2$ turns out to be exactly\ntwice the number of coastal points in $D=1$. We comment briefly on the surface\nmorphology and derive a roughness exponent $\\alpha$. In the second part, we\nstudy the percolation probability for a current in this model and two\nextensions of it, in which both the scale factor and the deposition probability\ncan take on different values between generations. We find that the percolation\nthreshold $P_c$ is located at exactly the same value for the deposition\nprobability as the threshold probability of the number of coastal points. This\ncoincidence suggests that exactly at the onset of percolation for a conducting\npath, the number of coastal points exhibits logarithmic fractal behaviour.",

      "abstract": "We systematically measure the superconducting (SC) and mixed state properties\nof high-quality CsV3Sb5 single crystals with Tc ~ 3.5 K. We find that the upper\ncritical field Hc2(T) exhibits a large anisotropic ratio of Hc2^(ab)/Hc2^(c) ~\n9 at zero temperature and fitting its temperature dependence requires a minimum\ntwo-band effective model. Moreover, the ratio of the lower critical field,\nHc1^(ab)/Hc1^(c), is also found to be larger than 1, which indicates that the\nin-plane energy dispersion is strongly renormalized near Fermi energy. Both\nHc1(T) and SC diamagnetic signal are found to change little initially below Tc\n~ 3.5 K and then to increase abruptly upon cooling to a characteristic\ntemperature of ~2.8 K. Furthermore, we identify a two-fold anisotropy of\nin-plane angular-dependent magnetoresistance in the mixed state. Interestingly,\nwe find that, below the same characteristic T ~ 2.8 K, the orientation of this\ntwo-fold anisotropy displays a peculiar twist by an angle of 60o characteristic\nof the Kagome geometry. Our results suggest an intriguing superconducting state\nemerging in the complex environment of Kagome lattice, which, at least, is\npartially driven by electron-electron correlation.",

      "title": "Online Multiple Object Tracking with Cross-Task Synergy",
      "abstract": "Modern online multiple object tracking (MOT) methods usually focus on two\ndirections to improve tracking performance. One is to predict new positions in\nan incoming frame based on tracking information from previous frames, and the\nother is to enhance data association by generating more discriminative identity\nembeddings. Some works combined both directions within one framework but\nhandled them as two individual tasks, thus gaining little mutual benefits. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel unified model with synergy between position\nprediction and embedding association. The two tasks are linked by\ntemporal-aware target attention and distractor attention, as well as\nidentity-aware memory aggregation model. Specifically, the attention modules\ncan make the prediction focus more on targets and less on distractors,\ntherefore more reliable embeddings can be extracted accordingly for\nassociation. On the other hand, such reliable embeddings can boost\nidentity-awareness through memory aggregation, hence strengthen attention\nmodules and suppress drifts. In this way, the synergy between position\nprediction and embedding association is achieved, which leads to strong\nrobustness to occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nour proposed model over a wide range of existing methods on MOTChallenge\nbenchmarks.

      "title": "A network-based analysis of disease modules from a taxonomic perspective",
      "abstract": "Objective: Human-curated disease ontologies are widely used for diagnostic\nevaluation, treatment and data comparisons over time, and clinical decision\nsupport. The classification principles underlying these ontologies are guided\nby the analysis of observable pathological similarities between disorders,\noften based on anatomical or histological principles. Although, thanks to\nrecent advances in molecular biology, disease ontologies are slowly changing to\nintegrate the etiological and genetic origins of diseases, nosology still\nreflects this \"reductionist\" perspective. Proximity relationships of disease\nmodules (hereafter DMs) in the human interactome network are now increasingly\nused in diagnostics, to identify pathobiologically similar diseases and to\nsupport drug repurposing and discovery. On the other hand, similarity relations\ninduced from structural proximity of DMs also have several limitations, such as\nincomplete knowledge of disease-gene relationships and reliability of clinical\ntrials to assess their validity. The purpose of the study described in this\npaper is to shed more light on disease similarities by analyzing the\nrelationship between categorical proximity of diseases in human-curated\nontologies and structural proximity of the related DM in the interactome.\nMethod: We propose a methodology (and related algorithms) to automatically\ninduce a hierarchical structure from proximity relations between DMs, and to\ncompare this structure with a human-curated disease taxonomy. Results: We\ndemonstrate that the proposed methodology allows to systematically analyze\ncommonalities and differences among structural and categorical similarity of\nhuman diseases, help refine and extend human disease classification systems,\nand identify promising network areas where new disease-gene interactions can be\ndiscovered.",

In particular, our prior work has shown that the ability to\nreason about spatial relations between objects in the world is a key\nrequirement for the development of Visually Intelligent Agents. In this paper,\nwe present a framework for commonsense spatial reasoning which is tailored to\nreal-world robotic applications. Differently from prior approaches to\nqualitative spatial reasoning, the proposed framework is robust to variations\nin the robot's viewpoint and object orientation. The spatial relations in the\nproposed framework are also mapped to the types of commonsense predicates used\nto describe typical object configurations in English. In addition, we also show\nhow this formally-defined framework can be implemented in a concrete spatial\ndatabase.",

Correlation\nfilter-based trackers consider visual tracking as a problem of matching the\nfeature template of the object and candidate regions in the detection sample,\nin which correlation filter provides the means to calculate the similarities.\nIn contrast, convolution filter is usually used for blurring, sharpening,\nembossing, edge detection, etc in image processing. On the surface, correlation\nfilter and convolution filter are usually used for different purposes. In this\npaper, however, we proves, for the first time, that correlation filter and\nconvolution filter are equivalent in the sense that their minimum mean-square\nerrors (MMSEs) in visual tracking are equal, under the condition that the\noptimal solutions exist and the ideal filter response is Gaussian and\ncentrosymmetric.

If $U$ denotes the unit disc, let $\\Gamma$ and $\\Gamma_0$ be the\nFuchsian groups with $S = U/{\\Gamma}$ and $S_0 = U/{\\Gamma_0}$. There is a\ngroup homomorphism of $\\Gamma_0$ onto $G$ with kernel $\\Gamma$ and this is\ntermed a surface kernel map. Two surface kernel maps are equivalent if they\ndiffer by an automorphism of $\\Gamma_0$. In his 1971 paper Harvey showed that\nwhen $G$ is a cyclic group, there is a unique simplest representative for this\nequivalence class. His result has played an important role in establishing\nsubsequent results about conformal automorphism groups of surfaces. We extend\nhis result to some surface kernel maps onto arbitrary finite groups. These can\nbe used along with the Schreier-Reidemeister Theory to find a set of generators\nfor $\\Gamma$ and the action of $G$ as an outer automorphism group on the\nfundamental group of $S$ putting the action on the fundamental group and the\ninduced action on homology into a relatively simple format. As an example we\ncompute generators for the fundamental group and a homology basis together with\nthe action of $G$ when $G$ is ${\\mathcal{S}_3$, the symmetric group on three\nletters. The action of $G$ shows that the homology basis found is not an\nadapted homology basis.",

In order to solve the governing equations, a pore-scale lattice\nBoltzmann method with the double distribution functions is used, in which a\nvolumetric LB scheme is employed to handle the boundary. The Monte Carlo random\nsampling is adopted to generate a microstructure of two-dimensional gradient\nfoam metal which are then used to simulate the solid-liquid phase transition in\nthe cavity. The effect of several factors, such as gradient porosity structure,\ngradient direction, Rayleigh number and particle diameters on the liquid\nfraction of PCM are systematically investigated. It is observed that the\npresence of gradient media affect significantly the melting rate and shortens\nfull melting time compared to that for constant porosity by enhancing natural\nconvection. The melting time of positive and negative gradients will change\nwith Rayleigh number, and there is a critical value for Rayleigh number.\nSpecifically, when Rayleigh number is below the critical value, the positive\ngradient is more advantageous, and when Rayleigh number exceeds the critical\nvalue, the negative gradient is more advantageous.

In\nthis paper, we investigate the instability and asymptotic behavior of planar\nfronts and planar pulses of the bidomain Allen-Cahn equation and the bidomain\nFitzHugh-Nagumo equation in two spatial dimension. In previous work, it was\nshown that planar fronts of the bidomain Allen-Cahn equation can become\nunstable in contrast to the classical Allen-Cahn equation. We find that, after\nthe planar front is destabilized, a rotating zigzag front develops whose shape\ncan be explained by simple geometric arguments using a suitable Frank diagram.\nWe also show that the Hopf bifurcation through which the front becomes unstable\ncan be either supercritical or subcritical, by demonstrating a parameter regime\nin which a stable planar front and zigzag front can coexist. In our\ncomputational studies of the bidomain FitzHugh-Nagumo pulse solution, we show\nthat the pulses can also become unstable much like the bidomain Allen-Cahn\nfronts. However, unlike the bidomain Allen-Cahn case, the destabilized pulse\ndoes not necessarily develop into a zigzag pulse. For certain choice of\nparameters, the destabilized pulse can disintegrate entirely. These studies are\nmade possible by the development of a numerical scheme that allows for the\naccurate computation of the bidomain equation in a two dimensional strip domain\nof infinite extent.",

      "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mm-wave) is a promising technique to enhance the network\ncapacity and coverage of next-generation (5G) based on utilizing a great number\nof available spectrum resources in mobile communication. Improving the 5G\nnetwork requires enhancing and employing mm-wave beamforming channel\npropagation characteristics. To achieve high data rates, system performance\nremains a challenge given the impact of propagation channels in mm-wave that is\ninsufficient in both path loss, delay spread, and penetration loss. Additional\nchallenges arise due to high cost and energy consumption, which require\ncombining both analog and digital beamforming (hybrid beamforming) to reduce\nthe number of radio frequency (RF) chains. In this paper, the distributed\npowers in the small cell to suppress path loss by specifying a considerable\npower and controlling the distributed power to reduce the high cost and energy\nconsumption was proposed. The hybrid beamforming in mm-wave exploits a large\nbandwidth which reduces the large path loss in Rayleigh fading channel. Also,\nthe trade-off between the energy consumption of RF chains and cost efficiency\ndepends on reducing the number of RF chains and the distributed number of\nusers. This paper finds that hybrid beamforming for massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) systems constitute a promising platform for advancing\nand capitalizing on 5G networks",

      "abstract": "Deep learning-based video manipulation methods have become widely accessible\nto the masses. With little to no effort, people can quickly learn how to\ngenerate deepfake (DF) videos. While deep learning-based detection methods have\nbeen proposed to identify specific types of DFs, their performance suffers for\nother types of deepfake methods, including real-world deepfakes, on which they\nare not sufficiently trained. In other words, most of the proposed deep\nlearning-based detection methods lack transferability and generalizability.\nBeyond detecting a single type of DF from benchmark deepfake datasets, we focus\non developing a generalized approach to detect multiple types of DFs, including\ndeepfakes from unknown generation methods such as DeepFake-in-the-Wild (DFW)\nvideos. To better cope with unknown and unseen deepfakes, we introduce a\nConvolutional LSTM-based Residual Network (CLRNet), which adopts a unique model\ntraining strategy and explores spatial as well as the temporal information in\ndeepfakes. Through extensive experiments, we show that existing defense methods\nare not ready for real-world deployment. Whereas our defense method (CLRNet)\nachieves far better generalization when detecting various benchmark deepfake\nmethods (97.57% on average). Furthermore, we evaluate our approach with a\nhigh-quality DeepFake-in-the-Wild dataset, collected from the Internet\ncontaining numerous videos and having more than 150,000 frames. Our CLRNet\nmodel demonstrated that it generalizes well against high-quality DFW videos by\nachieving 93.86% detection accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art\ndefense methods by a considerable margin.",

Our results provide a generic construction recipe for weighted modal\nquantales from such multisemigroups. This is illustrated by many examples,\nranging from modal algebras of weighted relations as used in fuzzy mathematics,\ncategory quantales in the tradition of category algebras or group rings,\nincidence algebras over partial orders, discrete and continuous weighted path\nalgebras, weighted languages of pomsets with interfaces, and weighted languages\nassociated with presimplicial and precubical sets.

      "abstract": "The primary objective of this paper is to present an approach for recommender\nsystems that can assimilate ranking to the voters or rankers so that\nrecommendation can be made by giving priority to experts suggestion over usual\nrecommendation. To accomplish this, we have incorporated the concept of\nhuman-centric aggregation via Ordered Weighted Aggregation (OWA). Here, we are\nadvocating ranked recommendation where rankers are assigned weights according\nto their place in the ranking. Further, the recommendation process which is\npresented here for the recommendation of books to university students exploits\nlinguistic data summaries and Ordered Weighted Aggregation (OWA) technique. In\nthe suggested approach, the weights are assigned in a way that it associates\nhigher weights to best ranked university. The approach has been evaluated over\neight different parameters. The superiority of the proposed approach is evident\nfrom the evaluation results. We claim that proposed scheme saves storage spaces\nrequired in traditional recommender systems as well as it does not need users\nprior preferences and hence produce a solution for cold start problem. This\nenvisaged that the proposed scheme can be very useful in decision making\nproblems, especially for recommender systems. In addition, it emphasizes on how\nhuman-centric aggregation can be useful in recommendation researches, and also\nit gives a new direction about how various human specific tasks can be\nnumerically aggregated.",

The\nproposed T-NORM model can be used to express abstract norms able to regulate\nclasses of actions that should or should not be performed in a temporal\ninterval. We show how the model can be used to formalize obligations and\nprohibitions and for inhibiting them by introducing permissions and exemptions.\nThe basic building blocks for norm specification consists of rules with\nsuitably nested components. The activation condition, the regulated actions,\nand the temporal constrains of norms are specified using the W3C Web Ontology\nLanguage (OWL 2). Thanks to this choice, it is possible to use OWL reasoning\nfor computing the effects that the logical implication between actions has on\nnorms fulfilment or violation. The operational semantics of the T-NORM model is\nspecified by providing an unambiguous procedure for translating every norm and\nevery exception into production rules.",

The stable phases of these binaries on both\ninitially hexagonal-close-packed (HCP) and face-centered-cubic (FCC) lattices\nhave been determined by utilizing an iterative approach that uses a\nconfigurational cluster expansion method, Monte Carlo search algorithm, and\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations.

By applying an isotropic pressure in the HCP lattice, $\\rm\nMg_{19}Zn_{45}$ turns into an unstable phase at P$\\approx$$10$~GPa, a new\nstable phase $\\rm Mg_{3}Zn$ appears at P$\\gtrsim$$20$~GPa, and $\\rm\nMg_{34}Zn_{30}$ becomes unstable for P$\\gtrsim$$30$~GPa. For FCC lattice, the\n$\\rm Mg_{3}Zn$ phase weakly touches the convex hull at P$\\gtrsim$$20$~GPa while\nthe other stable phases remain intact up to $\\approx$$120$~GPa. Furthermore,\nmaking use of the obtained DFT results, bulk modulus has been computed for\nseveral compositions up to pressure values of the order of $\\approx$$120$~GPa.\nThe findings suggest that one can switch between $\\rm Mg$-rich and $\\rm\nZn$-rich early-stage clusters simply by applying external pressure. $\\rm\nZn$-rich alloys and precipitates are more favorable in terms of stiffness and\nstability against external deformation.",

It is\na particular dynamic Bayesian network that allows to represent the dynamics of\na system by means of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and an autoregressive (AR)\nprocess. The Markov chain assumes that the system is switching back and forth\nbetween internal states while the AR process ensures a temporal coherence on\nsensor measurements. A sound learning procedure of standard ARHMM based on\nmaximum likelihood allows to iteratively estimate all parameters\nsimultaneously. This paper suggests a modification of the learning procedure\nconsidering that one may have prior knowledge about the structure which becomes\npartially hidden. The integration of the prior is based on the Theory of\nWeighted Distributions which is compatible with the Expectation-Maximization\nalgorithm in the sense that the convergence properties are still satisfied. We\nshow how to apply this model to estimate the remaining useful life based on\nhealth indicators. The autoregressive parameters can indeed be used for\nprediction while the latent structure can be used to get information about the\ndegradation level.

The\nhighest demand, however, comes from medical imaging, which requires\ncost-effective, high-resolution detectors operating at low photon flux,\ntherefore stimulating the search for novel materials and new approaches.\nRecently, hybrid halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) has attracted\nconsiderable attention due to its advantageous optoelectronic properties and\nlow fabrication costs. The presence of heavy atoms, providing a high scattering\ncross-section for photons, makes this material a perfect candidate for X-ray\ndetection. Despite the already-successful demonstrations of efficiency in\ndetection, its integration into standard microelectronics fabrication processes\nis still pending. Here, we demonstrate a promising method for building X-ray\ndetector units by 3D aerosol jet printing with a record sensitivity of 2.2 x\n108 {\\mu}C Gyair-1cm-2 when detecting 8 keV photons at dose-rates below 1 Gy/s\n(detection limit 0.12 Gy/s), a four-fold improvement on the best-in-class\ndevices.

Many tools exist to investigate the\ndetailed deterministic dynamics and especially the bulk behaviour of the\nfrequency. However, far less attention has been paid to its stochastic\nproperties, and there is a need for a cohesive framework that couples both\nshort-time scale fluctuations and bulk behaviour. Moreover, commonly assumed\nuncorrelated stochastic noise is predominantly employed in modelling in energy\nsystems. In this publication, we examine the stochastic properties of six\nsynchronous power-grid frequency recording with high-temporal resolution of the\nNordic Grid from September 2013, focusing on the increments of the frequency\nrecordings. We show that these increments follow non-Gaussian statistics and\ndisplay spatial and temporal correlations. Furthermore, we report two different\nphysical synchronisation phenomena: a very short timescale phase\nsynchronisation ($<2\\,$s) followed by a slightly larger timescale amplitude\nsynchronisation ($2\\,$s-$5\\,$s). Overall, these results provide guidance on how\nto model fluctuations in power systems.",

Through this work, we explored and tailored deep\nconvolutional networks (DCCNs) for the rapid characterization of cracks in SHCC\nfrom various kinds of photographs. The results from the controlled study\nsuggest that the inference ability of the tailored DCCN (TDCNN) is quite good,\nresilient against epistemic uncertainty, and tunable for completely independent\nbut adverse observations.

      "abstract": "Automated and accurate segmentations of left atrium (LA) and atrial scars\nfrom late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE CMR) images are\nin high demand for quantifying atrial scars. The previous quantification of\natrial scars relies on a two-phase segmentation for LA and atrial scars due to\ntheir large volume difference (unbalanced atrial targets). In this paper, we\npropose an inter-cascade generative adversarial network, namely JAS-GAN, to\nsegment the unbalanced atrial targets from LGE CMR images automatically and\naccurately in an end-to-end way. Firstly, JAS-GAN investigates an adaptive\nattention cascade to automatically correlate the segmentation tasks of the\nunbalanced atrial targets. The adaptive attention cascade mainly models the\ninclusion relationship of the two unbalanced atrial targets, where the\nestimated LA acts as the attention map to adaptively focus on the small atrial\nscars roughly. Then, an adversarial regularization is applied to the\nsegmentation tasks of the unbalanced atrial targets for making a consistent\noptimization. It mainly forces the estimated joint distribution of LA and\natrial scars to match the real ones. We evaluated the performance of our\nJAS-GAN on a 3D LGE CMR dataset with 192 scans. Compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods, our proposed approach yielded better segmentation\nperformance (Average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) values of 0.946 and\n0.821 for LA and atrial scars, respectively), which indicated the effectiveness\nof our proposed approach for segmenting unbalanced atrial targets.",

It\nis shown that all trajectories of the dynamical system (generated by the QSO)\nof the SEIR model are convergent (i.e. the QSO is regular).

      "abstract": "When making an online purchase, it becomes important for the customer to read\nthe product reviews carefully and make a decision based on that. However,\nreviews can be lengthy, may contain repeated, or sometimes irrelevant\ninformation that does not help in decision making. In this paper, we introduce\nMRCBert, a novel unsupervised method to generate summaries from product\nreviews. We leverage Machine Reading Comprehension, i.e. MRC, approach to\nextract relevant opinions and generate both rating-wise and aspect-wise\nsummaries from reviews. Through MRCBert we show that we can obtain reasonable\nperformance using existing models and transfer learning, which can be useful\nfor learning under limited or low resource scenarios. We demonstrated our\nresults on reviews of a product from the Electronics category in the Amazon\nReviews dataset. Our approach is unsupervised as it does not require any\ndomain-specific dataset, such as the product review dataset, for training or\nfine-tuning. Instead, we have used SQuAD v1.1 dataset only to fine-tune BERT\nfor the MRC task. Since MRCBert does not require a task-specific dataset, it\ncan be easily adapted and used in other domains.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion-weighted MRI is nowadays performed routinely due to its prognostic\nability, yet the quality of the scans are often unsatisfactory which can\nsubsequently hamper the clinical utility. To overcome the limitations, here we\npropose a fully unsupervised quality enhancement scheme, which boosts the\nresolution and removes the motion artifact simultaneously. This process is done\nby first training the network using optimal transport driven cycleGAN with\nstochastic degradation block which learns to remove aliasing artifacts and\nenhance the resolution, then using the trained network in the test stage by\nutilizing bootstrap subsampling and aggregation for motion artifact\nsuppression. We further show that we can control the trade-off between the\namount of artifact correction and resolution by controlling the bootstrap\nsubsampling ratio at the inference stage. To the best of our knowledge, the\nproposed method is the first to tackle super-resolution and motion artifact\ncorrection simultaneously in the context of MRI using unsupervised learning. We\ndemonstrate the efficiency of our method by applying it to both quantitative\nevaluation using simulation study, and to in vivo diffusion-weighted MR scans,\nwhich shows that our method is superior to the current state-of-the-art\nmethods. The proposed method is flexible in that it can be applied to various\nquality enhancement schemes in other types of MR scans, and also directly to\nthe quality enhancement of apparent diffusion coefficient maps.",

While fine-grained classification with high resolution\nimages has received significant attention, limited attention has been given to\nlow resolution images.

      "abstract": "Multi-view clustering is an important yet challenging task in machine\nlearning and data mining community. One popular strategy for multi-view\nclustering is matrix factorization which could explore useful feature\nrepresentations at lower-dimensional space and therefore alleviate dimension\ncurse. However, there are two major drawbacks in the existing work: i) most\nmatrix factorization methods are limited to shadow depth, which leads to the\ninability to fully discover the rich hidden information of original data. Few\ndeep matrix factorization methods provide a basis for the selection of the new\nrepresentation's dimensions of different layers. ii) the majority of current\napproaches only concentrate on the view-shared information and ignore the\nspecific local features in different views. To tackle the above issues, we\npropose a novel Multi-View Clustering method with Deep semi-NMF and Global\nGraph Refinement (MVC-DMF-GGR) in this paper. Firstly, we capture new\nrepresentation matrices for each view by hierarchical decomposition, then learn\na common graph by approximating a combination of graphs which are reconstructed\nfrom these new representations to refine the new representations in return. An\nalternate algorithm with proved convergence is then developed to solve the\noptimization problem and the results on six multi-view benchmarks demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and superiority of our proposed algorithm.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a new attack against face verification systems based on Deep\nNeural Networks (DNN). The attack relies on the introduction into the network\nof a hidden backdoor, whose activation at test time induces a verification\nerror allowing the attacker to impersonate any user. The new attack, named\nMaster Key backdoor attack, operates by interfering with the training phase, so\nto instruct the DNN to always output a positive verification answer when the\nface of the attacker is presented at its input. With respect to existing\nattacks, the new backdoor attack offers much more flexibility, since the\nattacker does not need to know the identity of the victim beforehand. In this\nway, he can deploy a Universal Impersonation attack in an open-set framework,\nallowing him to impersonate any enrolled users, even those that were not yet\nenrolled in the system when the attack was conceived. We present a practical\nimplementation of the attack targeting a Siamese-DNN face verification system,\nand show its effectiveness when the system is trained on VGGFace2 dataset and\ntested on LFW and YTF datasets. According to our experiments, the Master Key\nbackdoor attack provides a high attack success rate even when the ratio of\npoisoned training data is as small as 0.01, thus raising a new alarm regarding\nthe use of DNN-based face verification systems in security-critical\napplications.",

The medical conditions\nassociated with SARS-CoV-2 infections have resulted in a surge in the number of\npatients at clinics and hospitals, leading to a significantly increased strain\non healthcare resources. As such, an important part of managing and handling\npatients with SARS-CoV-2 infections within the clinical workflow is severity\nassessment, which is often conducted with the use of chest x-ray (CXR) images.\nIn this work, we introduce COVID-Net CXR-S, a convolutional neural network for\npredicting the airspace severity of a SARS-CoV-2 positive patient based on a\nCXR image of the patient's chest. More specifically, we leveraged transfer\nlearning to transfer representational knowledge gained from over 16,000 CXR\nimages from a multinational cohort of over 15,000 patient cases into a custom\nnetwork architecture for severity assessment. Experimental results with a\nmulti-national patient cohort curated by the Radiological Society of North\nAmerica (RSNA) RICORD initiative showed that the proposed COVID-Net CXR-S has\npotential to be a powerful tool for computer-aided severity assessment of CXR\nimages of COVID-19 positive patients. Furthermore, radiologist validation on\nselect cases by two board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 19 years of\nexperience, respectively, showed consistency between radiologist interpretation\nand critical factors leveraged by COVID-Net CXR-S for severity assessment.\nWhile not a production-ready solution, the ultimate goal for the open source\nrelease of COVID-Net CXR-S is to act as a catalyst for clinical scientists,\nmachine learning researchers, as well as citizen scientists to develop\ninnovative new clinical decision support solutions for helping clinicians\naround the world manage the continuing pandemic.",

We build on this\napproach by applying an evolutionary optimisation algorithm in connection with\nMaxwell equations solvers, showing that the proposed design recipe can be\napplied to any material platform. We explicitly calculate the second-harmonic\ngeneration efficiency for doubly resonant photonic crystal cavity designs in\ntypical III-V semiconductor materials, such as GaN and AlGaAs, targeting a\nfundamental harmonic at telecom wavelengths, and fully accounting for the\ntensor nature of the respective nonlinear susceptibilities. These results may\nstimulate the realisation of small footprint photonic nanostructures in leading\nsemiconductor material platforms to achieve unprecedented nonlinear\nefficiencies.",

      "abstract": "There has been a recent surge of interest in understanding the convergence of\ngradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in\noverparameterized neural networks. Most previous works assume that the training\ndata is provided a priori in a batch, while less attention has been paid to the\nimportant setting where the training data arrives in a stream. In this paper,\nwe study the streaming data setup and show that with overparamterization and\nrandom initialization, the prediction error of two-layer neural networks under\none-pass SGD converges in expectation. The convergence rate depends on the\neigen-decomposition of the integral operator associated with the so-called\nneural tangent kernel (NTK). A key step of our analysis is to show a random\nkernel function converges to the NTK with high probability using the VC\ndimension and McDiarmid's inequality.",

To solve the above issues, we propose a novel\nmulti-view clustering algorithm via deep matrix decomposition and partition\nalignment. To be specific, the partition representations of each view are\nobtained through deep matrix decomposition, and then are jointly utilized with\nthe optimal partition representation for fusing multi-view information.\nFinally, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve the\noptimization problem with proven convergence.

It utilizes\nthe fact that radar sensors have been used in vehicles for several decades\nalready. Therefore, previous findings on influencing factors can be used as a\nstarting point when assessing radar-based perception for driver assistance\nsystems and automated driving functions. On top of the literature review on\nenvironment factors influencing radar sensors, the paper introduces a modular\nstructuring concept for such that can facilitate real-world data analysis by\ncategorizing the factors possibly leading to performance limitations into\ndifferent independent clusters in order to reduce the level of detail in\ncomplex real-world environments.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) pipeline composition and optimisation have been studied\nto seek multi-stage ML models, i.e. preprocessor-inclusive, that are both valid\nand well-performing. These processes typically require the design and traversal\nof complex configuration spaces consisting of not just individual ML components\nand their hyperparameters, but also higher-level pipeline structures that link\nthese components together. Optimisation efficiency and resulting ML-model\naccuracy both suffer if this pipeline search space is unwieldy and excessively\nlarge; it becomes an appealing notion to avoid costly evaluations of poorly\nperforming ML components ahead of time. Accordingly, this paper investigates\nwhether, based on previous experience, a pool of available\nclassifiers/regressors can be preemptively culled ahead of initiating a\npipeline composition/optimisation process for a new ML problem, i.e. dataset.\nThe previous experience comes in the form of classifier/regressor accuracy\nrankings derived, with loose assumptions, from a substantial but non-exhaustive\nnumber of pipeline evaluations; this meta-knowledge is considered\n'opportunistic'. Numerous experiments with the AutoWeka4MCPS package, including\nones leveraging similarities between datasets via the relative landmarking\nmethod, show that, despite its seeming unreliability, opportunistic\nmeta-knowledge can improve ML outcomes. However, results also indicate that the\nculling of classifiers/regressors should not be too severe either.

      "abstract": "The mushroom growth of cellular users requires novel advancements in the\nexisting cellular infrastructure. One way to handle such a tremendous increase\nis to densely deploy terrestrial small-cell base stations (TSBSs) with careful\nmanagement of smart backhaul/fronthaul networks. Nevertheless, terrestrial\nbackhaul hubs significantly suffer from the dense fading environment and are\ndifficult to install in a typical urban environment. Therefore, this paper\nconsiders the idea of replacing terrestrial backhaul network with an aerial\nnetwork consisting of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide the fronthaul\nconnectivity between the TSBSs and the ground core-network (GCN). To this end,\nwe focus on the joint positioning of UAVs and the association of TSBSs such\nthat the sum-rate of the overall system is maximized. In particular, the\nassociation problem of TSBSs with UAVs is formulated under\ncommunication-related constraints, i.e., bandwidth, number of connections to a\nUAV, power limit, interference threshold, UAV heights, and backhaul data rate.\nTo meet this joint objective, we take advantage of the genetic algorithm (GA)\ndue to the offline nature of our optimization problem. The performance of the\nproposed approach is evaluated using the unsupervised learning-based k-means\nclustering algorithm. We observe that the proposed approach is highly effective\nto satisfy the requirements of smart fronthaul networks.",

In the latter\ncase, we propose a bootstrap-based methodology to take into account the effect\nof parameter estimation error.

      "abstract": "Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to a wide\nvariety of areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of transparency and\ninterpretability. While recent developments in explainable artificial\nintelligence attempt to bridge this gap (e.g., by visualizing the correlation\nbetween input pixels and final outputs), these approaches are limited to\nexplaining low-level relationships, and crucially, do not provide insights on\nerror correction. In this work, we propose a framework (VRX) to interpret\nclassification NNs with intuitive structural visual concepts. Given a trained\nclassification model, the proposed VRX extracts relevant class-specific visual\nconcepts and organizes them using structural concept graphs (SCG) based on\npairwise concept relationships. By means of knowledge distillation, we show VRX\ncan take a step towards mimicking the reasoning process of NNs and provide\nlogical, concept-level explanations for final model decisions. With extensive\nexperiments, we empirically show VRX can meaningfully answer \"why\" and \"why\nnot\" questions about the prediction, providing easy-to-understand insights\nabout the reasoning process.

      "abstract": "This article is a survey of our recent work on the connections between\nKoba-Nielsen amplitudes and local zeta functions (in the sense of Gel'fand,\nWeil, Igusa, Sato, Bernstein, Denef, Loeser, etc.). Our research program is\nmotivated by the fact that the p-adic strings seem to be related in some\ninteresting ways with ordinary strings. For instance, connections through the\nadelic relations and through the limit when p tends to 1. Gerasimov and\nShatashvili studied the limit p tends to 1 of the p-adic effective action\nintroduced by Brekke, Freund, Olson and Witten. They showed that this limit\ngives rise to a boundary string field theory, which was previously proposed by\nWitten in the context of background independent string theory. Explicit\ncomputations in the cases of 4 and 5 points show that the Feynman amplitudes at\nthe tree level of the Gerasimov-Shatashvili Lagrangian are related with the\nlimit p tends to 1 of the p-adic Koba-Nielsen amplitudes. At a mathematical\nlevel, this phenomenon is deeply connected with the topological zeta functions\nintroduced by Denef and Loeser. A Koba-Nielsen amplitude is just a new type of\nlocal zeta function, which can be studied by using embedded resolution of\nsingularities. In this way, one shows the existence of a meromorphic\ncontinuations for the Koba-Nielsen amplitudes as functions of the kinematic\nparameters. The Koba-Nielsen local zeta functions are algebraic-geometric\nintegrals that can be defined over arbitrary local fields (for instance R, C,\nQ_{p}, F_{p}((T)), and it is completely natural to expect connections between\nthese objects. The limit p tends to one of the Koba-Nielsen amplitudes give\nrise to a new amplitudes which we have called Denef-Loeser amplitudes. Along\nthe article, we have emphasized the explicit calculations in the cases of 4 and\n5 points.",

When a node is revealed, the algorithm learns\nabout the entire neighborhood of the node (including those nodes that have not\nyet been revealed). Furthermore, the adversary is required to keep the revealed\nportion of the graph connected at all times. We present an algorithm that\nachieves 2-competitiveness on trees and prove that this competitive ratio\ncannot be improved by any other algorithm.

      "abstract": "The increasingly sophisticated at-home screening systems for obstructive\nsleep apnea (OSA), integrated with both contactless and contact-based sensing\nmodalities, bring convenience and reliability to remote chronic disease\nmanagement. However, the device pairing processes between system components are\nvulnerable to wireless exploitation from a non-compliant user wishing to\nmanipulate the test results. This work presents SIENNA, an insider-resistant\ncontext-based pairing protocol. SIENNA leverages JADE-ICA to uniquely identify\na user's respiration pattern within a multi-person environment and fuzzy\ncommitment for automatic device pairing, while using friendly jamming technique\nto prevents an insider with knowledge of respiration patterns from acquiring\nthe pairing key. Our analysis and test results show that SIENNA can achieve\nreliable (> 90% success rate) device pairing under a noisy environment and is\nrobust against the attacker with full knowledge of the context information.",

In this paper, we introduce\na set of security properties and investigate the state of commercial\ncrowdsourced tracking systems, which present common design flaws that make them\ninsecure. Leveraging the results of our investigation, we propose a new design\nfor a secure crowdsourced tracking system (SECrow), which allows devices to\nleverage the benefits of the crowdsourced model without sacrificing security\nand privacy.

      "abstract": "Searching for health information online is becoming customary for more and\nmore consumers every day, which makes the need for efficient and reliable\nquestion answering systems more pressing. An important contributor to the\nsuccess rates of these systems is their ability to fully understand the\nconsumers' questions. However, these questions are frequently longer than\nneeded and mention peripheral information that is not useful in finding\nrelevant answers. Question summarization is one of the potential solutions to\nsimplifying long and complex consumer questions before attempting to find an\nanswer. In this paper, we study the task of abstractive summarization for\nreal-world consumer health questions. We develop an abstractive question\nsummarization model that leverages the semantic interpretation of a question\nvia recognition of medical entities, which enables the generation of\ninformative summaries. Towards this, we propose multiple Cloze tasks (i.e. the\ntask of filing missing words in a given context) to identify the key medical\nentities that enforce the model to have better coverage in question-focus\nrecognition. Additionally, we infuse the decoder inputs with question-type\ninformation to generate question-type driven summaries. When evaluated on the\nMeQSum benchmark corpus, our framework outperformed the state-of-the-art method\nby 10.2 ROUGE-L points. We also conducted a manual evaluation to assess the\ncorrectness of the generated summaries.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we present a general, efficient, and provably robust\nrepresentation for intrinsic triangulations. These triangulations have emerged\nas a powerful tool for robust geometry processing of surface meshes, taking a\nlow-quality mesh and retriangulating it with high-quality intrinsic triangles.\nHowever, existing representations either support only edge flips, or do not\noffer a robust procedure to recover the common subdivision, that is, how the\nintrinsic triangulation sits along the original surface. To build a\ngeneral-purpose robust structure, we extend the framework of normal\ncoordinates, which have been deeply studied in topology, as well as the more\nrecent idea of roundabouts from geometry processing, to support a variety of\nmesh processing operations like vertex insertions, edge splits, etc. The basic\nidea is to store an integer per mesh edge counting the number of times a curve\ncrosses that edge. We show that this paradigm offers a highly effective\nrepresentation for intrinsic triangulations with strong robustness guarantees.\nThe resulting data structure is general and efficient, while offering a\nguarantee of always encoding a valid subdivision. Among other things, this\nallows us to generate a high-quality intrinsic Delaunay refinement of all\nmanifold meshes in the challenging Thingi10k dataset for the first time. This\nenables a broad class of existing surface geometry algorithms to be applied\nout-of-the-box to low-quality triangulations.",

      "abstract": "We analyze families of primal high-order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin\n(HDG) methods for solving degenerate (second-order) elliptic problems. One\nmajor trouble regarding this class of PDEs concerns its mathematical nature,\nwhich may be nonuniform over the domain. Due to the local degeneracy of the\ndiffusion term, it can be purely hyperbolic in a subregion and elliptic in the\nrest. This problem is thus quite delicate to solve since the exact solution is\ndiscontinuous at interfaces separating both elliptic and hyperbolic parts. The\nproposed HDG method is developed in a unified and compact fashion. It can\nefficiently handle pure diffusive or advective regimes and intermediate regimes\nthat combine the above mechanisms for a wide range of P\\'eclet numbers,\nincluding the delicate situation of local evanescent diffusion. To this end, an\nadaptive stabilization strategy based on the addition of jump-penalty terms is\nthen considered. A $\\theta$-upwind-based scheme is favored for the hyperbolic\nregion, and an inspired Scharfetter--Gummel-based technique is preferred for\nthe elliptic region. The well-posedness of the HDG method is also discussed by\nanalyzing the consistency and discrete coercivity properties. Extensive\nnumerical experiments are finally considered to verify the model's robustness\nfor all the abovementioned regimes.",

However, existing\nlocal aggregation operators in the current literature fail to attach decent\nimportance to the local information of the point cloud, which limits the power\nof the models. To fit this gap, we propose an efficient Vector Attention\nConvolution module (VAConv), which utilizes K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to extract\nthe neighbor points of each input point, and then uses the elevation and\nazimuth relationship of the vectors between the center point and its neighbors\nto construct an attention weight matrix for edge features. Afterwards, the\nVAConv adopts a dual-channel structure to fuse weighted edge features and\nglobal features. To verify the efficiency of the VAConv, we connect the VAConvs\nwith different receptive fields in parallel to obtain a Multi-scale graph\nconvolutional network, VA-GCN. The proposed VA-GCN achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on standard benchmarks including ModelNet40, S3DIS and ShapeNet.\nRemarkably, on the ModelNet40 dataset for 3D classification, VA-GCN increased\nby 2.4% compared to the baseline.",

      "abstract": "Non-Hermitian systems with aperiodic order display phase transitions that are\nbeyond the paradigm of Hermitian physics. Unfortunately, owing to the\nincommensurability of the potential most of known non-Hermitian models are not\nintegrable. This motivates the search for exactly solvable models, where\nlocalization/delocalization phase transitions, mobility edges in complex plane\nand their topological nature can be unraveled. Here we present an exactly\nsolvable model of quasi crystal, which is a non-pertrurbative non-Hermitian\nextension of a famous integrable model of quantum chaos proposed by Grempel\n{\\it at al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 49}, 833 (1982)] and dubbed the Maryland\nmodel. Contrary to the Hermitian Maryland model, its non-Hermitian extension\nshows a richer scenario, with a localization-delocalization phase transition\nvia topological mobility edges in complex energy plane.",

Given the enormous volume of content posted daily,\nhuman monitoring of hate speech is unfeasible. In this work, we propose new\nword-level features for automatic hate speech detection (HSD): multiword\nexpressions (MWEs). MWEs are lexical units greater than a word that have\nidiomatic and compositional meanings. We propose to integrate MWE features in a\ndeep neural network-based HSD framework. Our baseline HSD system relies on\nUniversal Sentence Encoder (USE). To incorporate MWE features, we create a\nthree-branch deep neural network: one branch for USE, one for MWE categories,\nand one for MWE embeddings. We conduct experiments on two hate speech tweet\ncorpora with different MWE categories and with two types of MWE embeddings,\nword2vec and BERT. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed HSD system\nwith MWE features significantly outperforms the baseline system in terms of\nmacro-F1.",

This introduces a significant opportunity for\nevolution in the critical field of Intrusion Detection. However, offloading\nfunctionalities to the data plane is not a straightforward task.

      "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental component in many\napplications, such as Web Search and Voice Assistants. Although deep neural\nnetworks greatly improve the performance of NER, due to the requirement of\nlarge amounts of training data, deep neural networks can hardly scale out to\nmany languages in an industry setting. To tackle this challenge, cross-lingual\nNER transfers knowledge from a rich-resource language to languages with low\nresources through pre-trained multilingual language models. Instead of using\ntraining data in target languages, cross-lingual NER has to rely on only\ntraining data in source languages, and optionally adds the translated training\ndata derived from source languages. However, the existing cross-lingual NER\nmethods do not make good use of rich unlabeled data in target languages, which\nis relatively easy to collect in industry applications. To address the\nopportunities and challenges, in this paper we describe our novel practice in\nMicrosoft to leverage such large amounts of unlabeled data in target languages\nin real production settings. To effectively extract weak supervision signals\nfrom the unlabeled data, we develop a novel approach based on the ideas of\nsemi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The empirical study on\nthree benchmark data sets verifies that our approach establishes the new\nstate-of-the-art performance with clear edges. Now, the NER techniques reported\nin this paper are on their way to become a fundamental component for Web\nranking, Entity Pane, Answers Triggering, and Question Answering in the\nMicrosoft Bing search engine. Moreover, our techniques will also serve as part\nof the Spoken Language Understanding module for a commercial voice assistant.\nWe plan to open source the code of the prototype framework after deployment.",

This divides the trivectors into\nthree groups: nilpotent, semisimple, and mixed trivectors. Our classification\nfollows the same pattern. We use Galois cohomology to obtain the classification\nover R. For the nilpotent orbits this is in principle rather straightforward\nand the main problem is to determine the first Galois cohomology sets of a long\nlist of centralizers (we compute the centralizers using computer). For the\nsemisimple and mixed orbits we develop new methods based on Galois cohomology,\nfirst and second.

      "title": "Proactive Scheduling of Hydrogen Systems for Resilience Enhancement of\n  Distribution Networks",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in smart grid technologies bring opportunities to better\ncontrol the modern and complex power grids with renewable integration. The\noperation of power systems, especially distribution network (DN), is facing\nwith preeminent challenges from cyber-physical-human (CPH) threats and natural\ndisasters. In order to provide better response against threats and improve the\nresilience of power grid, proactive plans and operational schemes are required\nby system operators to minimize the damages caused by CPH threats. To that end,\nthis paper proposes a proactive plan for DN operation by using hydrogen (H2)\nsystems to enhance the resilience through cost-effective long-term energy\nstorage. Unlike batteries, H2 energy can be stored in the storage tanks days\nbefore the extreme event, and transformed into power by fuel cell units in the\npost-event time to reduce load curtailment caused by CPH threats. The proposed\nframework is validated by testing on 33-node test feeder. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that H2 systems can improve the resilience of DN during $N-m$\noutages lasting for more than 10 hours.",

      "abstract": "Over-the-air computation (AirComp) seamlessly integrates communication and\ncomputation by exploiting the waveform superposition property of\nmultiple-access channels. Different from the existing works that focus on\ntransceiver design of AirComp over static networks, this paper considers an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided AirComp system, where the UAV as a flying\nbase station aggregates data from mobile sensors. The trajectory design of the\nUAV provides an additional degree of freedom to improve the performance of\nAirComp. Our goal is to minimize the time-averaged mean-squared error (MSE) of\nAirComp by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, receive normalizing factors,\nand sensors' transmit power. To this end, we first propose a novel and\nequivalent problem transformation by introducing intermediate variables. This\nreformulation leads to a convex subproblem when fixing any other two blocks of\nvariables, thereby enabling efficient algorithm design based on the principle\nof block coordinate descent and alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM) techniques. In particular, we derive the optimal closed-form solutions\nfor normalizing factors and intermediate variables optimization subproblems. We\nalso recast the convex trajectory design subproblem into an ADMM form and\nobtain the closed-form expressions for each variable updating. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed algorithm achieves a smaller time-averaged MSE\nwhile reducing the simulation time by orders of magnitude compared to\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Recent image classification algorithms, by learning deep features from\nlarge-scale datasets, have achieved significantly better results comparing to\nthe classic feature-based approaches. However, there are still various\nchallenges of image classifications in practice, such as classifying noisy\nimage or image-set queries and training deep image classification models over\nthe limited-scale dataset. Instead of applying generic deep features, the\nmodel-based approaches can be more effective and data-efficient for robust\nimage and image-set classification tasks, as various image priors are exploited\nfor modeling the inter- and intra-set data variations while preventing\nover-fitting. In this work, we propose a novel Joint Statistical and Spatial\nSparse representation, dubbed \\textit{J3S}, to model the image or image-set\ndata for classification, by reconciling both their local patch structures and\nglobal Gaussian distribution mapped into Riemannian manifold. To the best of\nour knowledge, no work to date utilized both global statistics and local patch\nstructures jointly via joint sparse representation. We propose to solve the\njoint sparse coding problem based on the J3S model, by coupling the local and\nglobal image representations using joint sparsity. The learned J3S models are\nused for robust image and image-set classification. Experiments show that the\nproposed J3S-based image classification scheme outperforms the popular or\nstate-of-the-art competing methods over FMD, UIUC, ETH-80 and YTC databases.",

In this paper,\nwe propose to equip the Seq2Tree model with a context-based Branch Selector,\nwhich is able to dynamically determine optimal expansion orders of branches for\nmulti-branch nodes.

Addressing this problem, we first\nempirically analyze the roles of unseen-class samples with different degrees of\nhardness in the training process based on the uneven prediction phenomenon\nfound in many ZSL methods, resulting in three observations. Then, we propose\ntwo hardness sampling approaches for selecting a subset of diverse and hard\nsamples from a given unseen-class dataset according to these observations. The\nfirst one identifies the samples based on the class-level frequency of the\nmodel predictions while the second enhances the former by normalizing the class\nfrequency via an approximate class prior estimated by an explored prior\nestimation algorithm. Finally, we design a new Self-Training framework with\nHardness Sampling for T-ZSL, called STHS, where an arbitrary inductive ZSL\nmethod could be seamlessly embedded and it is iteratively trained with\nunseen-class samples selected by the hardness sampling approach. We introduce\ntwo typical ZSL methods into the STHS framework and extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the derived T-ZSL methods outperform many state-of-the-art\nmethods on three public benchmarks. Besides, we note that the unseen-class\ndataset is separately used for training in some existing transductive\ngeneralized ZSL (T-GZSL) methods, which is not strict for a GZSL task.

      "title": "Classes in Object-Oriented Modeling (UML): Further Understanding and\n  Abstraction",
      "abstract": "Object orientation has become the predominant paradigm for conceptual\nmodeling (e.g., UML), where the notions of class and object form the primitive\nbuilding blocks of thought. Classes act as templates for objects that have\nattributes and methods (actions). The modeled systems are not even necessarily\nsoftware systems: They can be human and artificial systems of many different\nkinds (e.g., teaching and learning systems). The UML class diagram is described\nas a central component of model-driven software development. It is the most\ncommon diagram in object-oriented models and used to model the static design\nview of a system. Objects both carry data and execute actions. According to\nsome authorities in modeling, a certain degree of difficulty exists in\nunderstanding the semantics of these notions in UML class diagrams. Some\nresearchers claim class diagrams have limited use for conceptual analysis and\nthat they are best used for logical design. Performing conceptual analysis\nshould not concern the ways facts are grouped into structures. Whether a fact\nwill end up in the design as an attribute is not a conceptual issue. UML leads\nto drilling down into physical design details (e.g., private/public attributes,\nencapsulated operations, and navigating direction of an association). This\npaper is a venture to further the understanding of object-orientated concepts\nas exemplified in UML with the aim of developing a broad comprehension of\nconceptual modeling fundamentals. Thinging machine (TM) modeling is a new\nmodeling language employed in such an undertaking. TM modeling interlaces\nstructure (components) and actionality where actions infiltrate the attributes\nas much as the classes. Although space limitations affect some aspects of the\nclass diagram, the concluding assessment of this study reveals the class\ndescription is a kind of shorthand for a richer sematic TM construct.",

The relationship between\nagronomic characteristics and yields of the mutants was investigated. Moreover,\ndifferences in physiological and biochemical properties and seed nutrients were\nanalyzed. The results demonstrated that the plant height, effective pods per\nplant, and yield per plant of mutant Leaf-M1 were 45.0%, 43.2%, and 50.9%\nhigher than those of the control group. Further analysis attributed the\nincrease in yield per plant to the increased branching number. The yield per\nplant of mutant Leaf-M2 was 7.8% higher than that of the control group, which\ncould be related with the increased chlorophyll content in the leaves. There\nwas a significant difference between the two mutants in the increase of yield\nper plant owing to morphological variation between the two mutants. There were\nsignificant differences in SOD activity and MDA content between the two mutants\nand the control, indicating that the physiological regulation of the two\nmutants also changed. In addition, the iron element content of seeds of the two\nmutants were about 10.9% lower than in the seeds of the control group, a\nsignificant difference. These findings indicate that the mutants Leaf-M1 and\nLeaf-M2 have breeding value and material value for molecular biological\nstudies.",

Considering the degradation\nof the model performance due to the statistic heterogeneity of the training\ndata, we devise a runtime distribution reconstruction strategy, which\nreallocates the clients appropriately and utilizes mediators to rearrange the\nlocal training of the clients. In addition, we design a compression-correction\nmechanism incorporated into H-FL to reduce the communication overhead while not\nsacrificing the model performance. To further provide privacy guarantees, we\nintroduce differential privacy while performing local training, which injects\nmoderate amount of noise into only part of the complete model. Experimental\nresults show that our H-FL framework achieves the state-of-art performance on\ndifferent datasets for the real-world image recognition tasks.",

      "abstract": "Given a matrix $X\\in \\mathbb{R}_+^{m\\times n}$ with nonnegative entries, a\nPositive Semidefinite (PSD) factorization of $X$ is a collection of $r \\times\nr$-dimensional PSD matrices $\\{A_i\\}$ and $\\{B_j\\}$ satisfying $X_{ij}=\n\\mathrm{tr}(A_i B_j)$ for all $\\ i\\in [m],\\ j\\in [n]$. PSD factorizations are\nfundamentally linked to understanding the expressiveness of semidefinite\nprograms as well as the power and limitations of quantum resources in\ninformation theory. The PSD factorization task generalizes the Non-negative\nMatrix Factorization (NMF) problem where we seek a collection of\n$r$-dimensional nonnegative vectors $\\{a_i\\}$ and $\\{b_j\\}$ satisfying $X_{ij}=\na_i^\\top b_j$, for all $i\\in [m],\\ j\\in [n]$ -- one can recover the latter\nproblem by choosing matrices in the PSD factorization to be diagonal. The most\nwidely used algorithm for computing NMFs of a matrix is the Multiplicative\nUpdate algorithm developed by Lee and Seung, in which nonnegativity of the\nupdates is preserved by scaling with positive diagonal matrices. In this paper,\nwe describe a non-commutative extension of Lee-Seung's algorithm, which we call\nthe Matrix Multiplicative Update (MMU) algorithm, for computing PSD\nfactorizations. The MMU algorithm ensures that updates remain PSD by congruence\nscaling with the matrix geometric mean of appropriate PSD matrices, and it\nretains the simplicity of implementation that Lee-Seung's algorithm enjoys.\nBuilding on the Majorization-Minimization framework, we show that under our\nupdate scheme the squared loss objective is non-increasing and fixed points\ncorrespond to critical points. The analysis relies on Lieb's Concavity Theorem.\nBeyond PSD factorizations, we use the MMU algorithm as a primitive to calculate\nblock-diagonal PSD factorizations and tensor PSD factorizations. We demonstrate\nthe utility of our method with experiments on real and synthetic data.",

      "title": "More Behind Your Electricity Bill: a Dual-DNN Approach to Non-Intrusive\n  Load Monitoring",
      "abstract": "Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a well-known single-channel blind\nsource separation problem that aims to decompose the household energy\nconsumption into itemised energy usage of individual appliances. In this way,\nconsiderable energy savings could be achieved by enhancing household's\nawareness of energy usage. Recent investigations have shown that deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) based approaches are promising for the NILM task. Nevertheless,\nthey normally ignore the inherent properties of appliance operations in the\nnetwork design, potentially leading to implausible results. We are thus\nmotivated to develop the dual Deep Neural Networks (dual-DNN), which aims to i)\ntake advantage of DNNs' learning capability of latent features and ii) empower\nthe DNN architecture with identification ability of universal properties.\nSpecifically in the design of dual-DNN, we adopt one subnetwork to measure\npower ratings of different appliances' operation states, and the other\nsubnetwork to identify the running states of target appliances. The final\nresult is then obtained by multiplying these two network outputs and meanwhile\nconsidering the multi-state property of household appliances. To enforce the\nsparsity property in appliance's state operating, we employ median filtering\nand hard gating mechanisms to the subnetwork for state identification. Compared\nwith the state-of-the-art NILM methods, our dual-DNN approach demonstrates a\n21.67% performance improvement in average on two public benchmark datasets.",

Machine learning systems, on the\nother hand, usually leverage spurious correlations in the training data, and\nwhile such correlations can help recognize objects in context, they hurt\ngeneralization. To be able to deal with underspecified datasets while still\nleveraging contextual clues during classification, we propose ProtoProp, a\nnovel prototype propagation graph method. First we learn prototypical\nrepresentations of objects (e.g., zebra) that are conditionally independent\nw.r.t. their attribute labels (e.g., stripes) and vice versa. Next we propagate\nthe independent prototypes through a compositional graph, to learn\ncompositional prototypes of novel attribute-object combinations that reflect\nthe dependencies of the target distribution. The method does not rely on any\nexternal data, such as class hierarchy graphs or pretrained word embeddings. We\nevaluate our approach on AO-Clever, a synthetic and strongly visual dataset\nwith clean labels, and UT-Zappos, a noisy real-world dataset of fine-grained\nshoe types.

      "abstract": "CTR prediction, which aims to estimate the probability that a user will click\nan item, plays a crucial role in online advertising and recommender system.\nFeature interaction modeling based and user interest mining based methods are\nthe two kinds of most popular techniques that have been extensively explored\nfor many years and have made great progress for CTR prediction. However, (1)\nfeature interaction based methods which rely heavily on the co-occurrence of\ndifferent features, may suffer from the feature sparsity problem (i.e., many\nfeatures appear few times); (2) user interest mining based methods which need\nrich user behaviors to obtain user's diverse interests, are easy to encounter\nthe behavior sparsity problem (i.e., many users have very short behavior\nsequences). To solve these problems, we propose a novel module named Dual Graph\nenhanced Embedding, which is compatible with various CTR prediction models to\nalleviate these two problems. We further propose a Dual Graph enhanced\nEmbedding Neural Network (DG-ENN) for CTR prediction. Dual Graph enhanced\nEmbedding exploits the strengths of graph representation with two carefully\ndesigned learning strategies (divide-and-conquer, curriculum-learning-inspired\norganized learning) to refine the embedding. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world industrial datasets. The experimental results\nshow that our proposed DG-ENN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CTR\nprediction models. Moreover, when applying to state-of-the-art CTR prediction\nmodels, Dual graph enhanced embedding always obtains better performance.\nFurther case studies prove that our proposed dual graph enhanced embedding\ncould alleviate the feature sparsity and behavior sparsity problems.

      "abstract": "Ordering the collection of states of a given automaton starting from an order\nof the underlying alphabet is a natural move towards a computational treatment\nof the language accepted by the automaton. Along this path, Wheeler\n\\emph{graphs} have been recently introduced as an extension/adaptation of the\nBurrows-Wheeler Transform (the now famous BWT, originally defined on strings)\nto graphs. These graphs constitute an important data-structure for languages,\nsince they allow a very efficient storage mechanism for the transition function\nof an automaton, while providing a fast support to all sorts of substring\nqueries. This is possible as a consequence of a property -- the so-called\n\\emph{path coherence} -- valid on Wheeler graphs and consisting in an ordering\non nodes that \"propagates\" to (collections of) strings. By looking at a Wheeler\ngraph as an automaton, the ordering on strings corresponds to the\nco-lexicographic order of the words entering each state. This leads naturally\nto consider the class of regular languages accepted by Wheeler automata, i.e.\nthe Wheeler languages.\n  It has been shown that, as opposed to the general case, the classic\ndeterminization by powerset construction is polynomial on Wheeler languages. As\na consequence, most of the classical problems turn out to be \"easy\" -- that is,\nsolvable in polynomial time -- on Wheeler languages. Moreover, deciding whether\na DFA is Wheeler and deciding whether a DFA accepts a Wheeler language is\npolynomial.\n  Our contribution here is to put an upper bound to easy problems. For\ninstance, whenever we generalize by switching to general NFAs or by not fixing\nan order of the underlying alphabet, the above mentioned problems become \"hard\"\n-- that is NP-complete or even PSPACE-complete.",

      "abstract": "We study principal-agent problems in which a principal commits to an\noutcome-dependent payment scheme (a.k.a. contract) so as to induce an agent to\ntake a costly, unobservable action. We relax the assumption that the principal\nperfectly knows the agent by considering a Bayesian setting where the agent's\ntype is unknown and randomly selected according to a given probability\ndistribution, which is known to the principal. Each agent's type is\ncharacterized by her own action costs and action-outcome distributions. In the\nliterature on non-Bayesian principal-agent problems, considerable attention has\nbeen devoted to linear contracts, which are simple, pure-commission payment\nschemes that still provide nice approximation guarantees with respect to\nprincipal-optimal (possibly non-linear) contracts. While in non-Bayesian\nsettings an optimal contract can be computed efficiently, this is no longer the\ncase for our Bayesian principal-agent problems. This further motivates our\nfocus on linear contracts, which can be optimized efficiently given their\nsingle-parameter nature. Our goal is to analyze the properties of linear\ncontracts in Bayesian settings, in terms of approximation guarantees with\nrespect to optimal contracts and general tractable contracts (i.e.,\nefficiently-computable ones). First, we study the approximation guarantees of\nlinear contracts with respect to optimal ones, showing that the former suffer\nfrom a multiplicative loss linear in the number of agent's types. Nevertheless,\nwe prove that linear contracts can still provide a constant multiplicative\napproximation $\\rho$ of the optimal principal's expected utility, though at the\nexpense of an exponentially-small additive loss $2^{-\\Omega(\\rho)}$. Then, we\nswitch to tractable contracts, showing that, surprisingly, linear contracts\nperform well among them.",

      "abstract": "The next-generation non-volatile memory (NVM) is striding into computer\nsystems as a new tier as it incorporates both DRAM's byte-addressability and\ndisk's persistency. Researchers and practitioners have considered building\npersistent memory by placing NVM on the memory bus for CPU to directly load and\nstore data. As a result, cache-friendly data structures have been developed for\nNVM. One of them is the prevalent B+-tree. State-of-the-art in-NVM B+-trees\nmainly focus on the optimization of write operations (insertion and deletion).\nHowever, search is of vital importance for B+-tree. Not only search-intensive\nworkloads benefit from an optimized search, but insertion and deletion also\nrely on a preceding search operation to proceed. In this paper, we attentively\nstudy a sorted B+-tree node that spans over contiguous cache lines. Such cache\nlines exhibit a monotonically increasing trend and searching a target key\nacross them can be accelerated by estimating a range the key falls into. To do\nso, we construct a probing Sentinel Array in which a sentinel stands for each\ncache line of B+-tree node. Checking the Sentinel Array avoids scanning\nunnecessary cache lines and hence significantly reduces cache misses for a\nsearch. A quantitative evaluation shows that using Sentinel Arrays boosts the\nsearch performance of state-of-the-art in-NVM B+-trees by up to 48.4% while the\ncost of maintaining of Sentinel Array is low.",

Chiral routing arises from the electromagnetic field\nchirality in waveguide, and beamsplitting is obtained via the evanescent field\ncoupling.

Inspired by this\nmechanism, we propose CluSTeR to predict future facts in a two-stage manner,\nClue Searching and Temporal Reasoning, accordingly. Specifically, at the clue\nsearching stage, CluSTeR learns a beam search policy via reinforcement learning\n(RL) to induce multiple clues from historical facts. At the temporal reasoning\nstage, it adopts a graph convolution network based sequence method to deduce\nanswers from clues.

First, based on newly compiled annotation guidelines, we\nmanually annotate a word-internal structure treebank (WIST) consisting of over\n30K multi-char words from Chinese Penn Treebank.

      "title": "Studying Duplicate Logging Statements and Their Relationships with Code\n  Clones",
      "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on studying duplicate logging statements, which are\nlogging statements that have the same static text message. We manually studied\nover 4K duplicate logging statements and their surrounding code in five\nlarge-scale open source systems. We uncovered five patterns of duplicate\nlogging code smells. For each instance of the duplicate logging code smell, we\nfurther manually identify the potentially problematic and justifiable cases.\nThen, we contact developers to verify our manual study result. We integrated\nour manual study result and the feedback of developers into our automated\nstatic analysis tool, DLFinder, which automatically detects problematic\nduplicate logging code smells. We evaluated DLFinder on the five manually\nstudied systems and three additional systems. In total, combining the results\nof DLFinder and our manual analysis, we reported 91 problematic duplicate\nlogging code smell instances to developers and all of them have been fixed. We\nfurther study the relationship between duplicate logging statements, including\nthe problematic instances of duplicate logging code smells, and code clones. We\nfind that 83% of the duplicate logging code smell instances reside in cloned\ncode, but 17% of them reside in micro-clones that are difficult to detect using\nautomated clone detection tools. We also find that more than half of the\nduplicate logging statements reside in cloned code snippets, and a large\nportion of them reside in very short code blocks which may not be effectively\ndetected by existing code clone detection tools. Our study shows that, in\naddition to general source code that implements the business logic, code clones\nmay also result in bad logging practices that could increase maintenance\ndifficulties.",

Of particular importance is the development of\nmodel-free techniques that work without knowledge about the underlying channel.\nSuch techniques utilize for example generative adversarial networks to estimate\nand model the conditional channel distribution, mutual information estimation\nas a reward function, or reinforcement learning. In this paper, the approach of\nreinforcement learning is studied and, in particular, the policy gradient\nmethod for a model-free approach of neural network-based secure encoding is\ninvestigated.

We use data from a historical nondemocratic\nsociety with a weighted voting system where eligible voters received votes in\nproportion to their taxable income and without any limit on the maximum of\nvotes, i.e., the political system used in Swedish local governments during the\nperiod 1862-1909. We use a novel identification strategy where we combine two\ndifferent identification strategies, i.e., a threshold regression analysis and\na generalized event-study design, both of which exploit nonlinearities or\ndiscontinuities in the effect of political power between two opposing local\nelites: agricultural landowners and emerging industrialists. The results\nsuggest that school spending is approximately 90-120% higher if the nonagrarian\ninterest controls all of the votes compared to when landowners have more than a\nmajority of votes.

We also calculate the momentum dependence of the\ntransparency ratio for the $^{184}$W/$^{12}$C combination for $\\Xi^-$ hyperons\nat these $K^-$ beam momenta. We show that the $\\Xi^-$ differential and total\n(absolute and relative) production cross sections at the considered initial\nmomenta reveal a distinct sensitivity to the variations in the scalar $\\Xi^-$\nnuclear potential at saturation density $\\rho_0$, studied in the paper, in the\nlow-momentum region of 0.1--0.6 GeV/c.

Therefore,\nthe measurement of these absolute and relative observables in a dedicated\nexperiment at the J-PARC will provide valuable information on the $\\Xi^-$\nin-medium properties, which will be complementary to that deduced from the\nstudy of the inclusive ($K^-$,$K^+$) reactions at incident momenta of 1.6--1.8\nGeV/c in the $\\Xi^-$ bound and quasi-free regions.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents a distinctive and straightforward technique for\nstabilization of multi-variable systems. The idea is to decouple the system\nstate matrix depending on different inputs and outputs. Refined special\ncanonical transformations are described for the design of controller and\nobserver for a single-input and single-output (SISO) case and are extended to\nmulti-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. These transformations help in the\nstabilization of the error dynamics of the observer and in placing the closed\nloop poles of the system. The idea is not only in the transformations taken but\nalso how the gain matrices are selected which simplifies the computation.",

      "title": "Predicting COVID-19 Spread from Large-Scale Mobility Data",
      "abstract": "To manage the COVID-19 epidemic effectively, decision-makers in public health\nneed accurate forecasts of case numbers. A potential near real-time predictor\nof future case numbers is human mobility; however, research on the predictive\npower of mobility is lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel model for\nepidemic forecasting based on mobility data, called mobility marked Hawkes\nmodel. The proposed model consists of three components: (1) A Hawkes process\ncaptures the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. (2) A mark modulates\nthe rate of infections, thus accounting for how the reproduction number R\nvaries across space and time. The mark is modeled using a regularized Poisson\nregression based on mobility covariates. (3) A correction procedure\nincorporates new cases seeded by people traveling between regions. Our model\nwas evaluated on the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. Specifically, we used\nmobility data from February through April 2020, amounting to approximately 1.5\nbillion trips. Trip counts were derived from large-scale telecommunication\ndata, i.e., cell phone pings from the Swisscom network, the largest\ntelecommunication provider in Switzerland. We compared our model against\nvarious state-of-the-art baselines in terms of out-of-sample root mean squared\nerror. We found that our model outperformed the baselines by 15.52%. The\nimprovement was consistently achieved across different forecast horizons\nbetween 5 and 21 days. In addition, we assessed the predictive power of\nconventional point of interest data, confirming that telecommunication data is\nsuperior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to predict the\nspread of COVID-19 from telecommunication data. Altogether, our work\ncontributes to previous research by developing a scalable early warning system\nfor decision-makers in public health tasked with controlling the spread of\ninfectious diseases.",

While the\nobtained results are usually still not competitive with problem-specific\nsolution approaches from the operations research community, GCNs often lead to\nimprovements compared to previous machine learning approaches for classical\nCOPs such as the traveling salesperson problem (TSP).\n  In this work we present a preliminary study on using GCNs for solving the\nvertex p-center problem (PCP), which is another classic COP on graphs. In\nparticular, we investigate whether a successful model based on end-to-end\ntraining for the TSP can be adapted to a PCP, which is defined on a similar 2D\nEuclidean graph input as the usually used version of the TSP. However, the\nobjective of the PCP has a min-max structure which could lead to many symmetric\noptimal, i.e., ground-truth solutions and other potential difficulties for\nlearning.

Computer vision literature\nreports the best results on the image-sentence matching task using deep neural\nnetworks equipped with attention and self-attention mechanisms.

Although the manipulations of flexible objects using\nrobots attract ever increasing attention since these tasks are the basic and\nessential activities in our daily life, it has been put into practice only\nrecently with the help of deep neural networks.

In the considered network, one of the\nauthorized users, Bob, needs a secure and covert communication, and therefore\nhis message must be sent securely, and at the same time, the existence of his\ncommunication with the transmitter should not be detected by the channel's\nwarden, Willie, Meanwhile, another authorized user, Carol, needs covert\ncommunication. The purpose of secure communication is to prevent the message\nbeing decoded by the untrusted user who is present on the network, which leads\nus to use one of the physical layer security methods, named the secure\ntransmission of information theory. In some cases, in addition to protecting\nthe content of the message, it is important for the user that the existence of\nthe transmission not being detected by an adversary, which leads us to covert\ncommunication. In the proposed network model, it is assumed that for covert\ncommunication requirements, Alice will not send any messages to legitimate\nusers in one time slot and in another time slot will send to them both (Bob and\nCarol). One of the main challenges in covert communication is low transmission\nrate, because we have to reduce the transmission power such that the main\nmessage get hide in background noise.",

Typical precision\nin the data is $\\pm$1.5 % for TESS and $\\pm$0.1 % (in 1 minute) for Spitzer.\nResults: The optical and infrared light curves periodically exhibit epochs of\nquasi-sinusoidal modulation followed by epochs of stochastic variability, which\nresembles the beat pattern created by two waves of similar frequencies that\ninterfere with each other. Our two-wave model for the TESS data shows that the\ncomponents of VHS J1256-1257AB rotate with periods of $2.0782\\pm0.0004$ h and\n$2.1342\\pm0.0003$ h, which is also supported by the Spitzer observations. As a\nresult, the fluxes of the equally bright VHS J1256-1257A and B alternate\nbetween states of phase and anti-phase, explaining the observed photometric\nvariability in their combined light. The projected spectroscopic velocity of\nVHS J1256-1257AB is remarkably similar to those obtained by combining the\nmeasured rotation periods and the expected radii, which indicates that the spin\naxes of VHS J1256-1257A and B are likely inclined at nearly 90 deg, as\npreviously reported for VHS J1256-1257 b.",

      "abstract": "The online recruitment matching system has been the core technology and\nservice platform in CareerBuilder. One of the major challenges in an online\nrecruitment scenario is to provide good matches between job posts and\ncandidates using a recommender system on the scale. In this paper, we discussed\nthe techniques for applying an embedding-based recommender system for the large\nscale of job to candidates matching. To learn the comprehensive and effective\nembedding for job posts and candidates, we have constructed a fused-embedding\nvia different levels of representation learning from raw text, semantic\nentities and location information. The clusters of fused-embedding of job and\ncandidates are then used to build and train the Faiss index that supports\nruntime approximate nearest neighbor search for candidate retrieval. After the\nfirst stage of candidate retrieval, a second stage reranking model that\nutilizes other contextual information was used to generate the final matching\nresult. Both offline and online evaluation results indicate a significant\nimprovement of our proposed two-staged embedding-based system in terms of\nclick-through rate (CTR), quality and normalized discounted accumulated gain\n(nDCG), compared to those obtained from our baseline system. We further\ndescribed the deployment of the system that supports the million-scale job and\ncandidate matching process at CareerBuilder. The overall improvement of our job\nto candidate matching system has demonstrated its feasibility and scalability\nat a major online recruitment site.",

      "abstract": "Visual localization is one of the most important components for robotics and\nautonomous driving. Recently, inspiring results have been shown with CNN-based\nmethods which provide a direct formulation to end-to-end regress 6-DoF absolute\npose. Additional information like geometric or semantic constraints is\ngenerally introduced to improve performance. Especially, the latter can\naggregate high-level semantic information into localization task, but it\nusually requires enormous manual annotations. To this end, we propose a novel\nauxiliary learning strategy for camera localization by introducing\nscene-specific high-level semantics from self-supervised representation\nlearning task. Viewed as a powerful proxy task, image colorization task is\nchosen as complementary task that outputs pixel-wise color version of grayscale\nphotograph without extra annotations. In our work, feature representations from\ncolorization network are embedded into localization network by design to\nproduce discriminative features for pose regression. Meanwhile an attention\nmechanism is introduced for the benefit of localization performance.

      "abstract": "Reconstructing the scene of robotic surgery from the stereo endoscopic video\nis an important and promising topic in surgical data science, which potentially\nsupports many applications such as surgical visual perception, robotic surgery\neducation and intra-operative context awareness. However, current methods are\nmostly restricted to reconstructing static anatomy assuming no tissue\ndeformation, tool occlusion and de-occlusion, and camera movement. However,\nthese assumptions are not always satisfied in minimal invasive robotic\nsurgeries. In this work, we present an efficient reconstruction pipeline for\nhighly dynamic surgical scenes that runs at 28 fps. Specifically, we design a\ntransformer-based stereoscopic depth perception for efficient depth estimation\nand a light-weight tool segmentor to handle tool occlusion. After that, a\ndynamic reconstruction algorithm which can estimate the tissue deformation and\ncamera movement, and aggregate the information over time is proposed for\nsurgical scene reconstruction. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on two\ndatasets, the public Hamlyn Centre Endoscopic Video Dataset and our in-house\nDaVinci robotic surgery dataset. The results demonstrate that our method can\nrecover the scene obstructed by the surgical tool and handle the movement of\ncamera in realistic surgical scenarios effectively at real-time speed.",

      "abstract": "Avoiding collisions is the core problem in multi-agent navigation. In\ndecentralized settings, when agents have limited communication and sensory\ncapabilities, collisions are typically avoided in a reactive fashion, relying\non local observations/communications. Prominent collision avoidance techniques,\ne.g. ORCA, are computationally efficient and scale well to a large number of\nagents. However, in numerous scenarios, involving navigation through the tight\npassages or confined spaces, deadlocks are likely to occur due to the egoistic\nbehaviour of the agents and as a result, the latter can not achieve their\ngoals. To this end, we suggest an application of the locally confined\nmulti-agent path finding (MAPF) solvers that coordinate sub-groups of the\nagents that appear to be in a deadlock (to detect the latter we suggest a\nsimple, yet efficient ad-hoc routine). We present a way to build a grid-based\nMAPF instance, typically required by modern MAPF solvers. We evaluate two of\nthem in our experiments, i.e. Push and Rotate and a bounded-suboptimal version\nof Conflict Based Search (ECBS), and show that their inclusion into the\nnavigation pipeline significantly increases the success rate, from 15% to 99%\nin certain cases.",

This can be\nattributed to either an algorithmic shortcoming or a fundamental property of\nthe training data distribution, which admits different solutions for optimal\nstandard and adversarial classifiers. In this work, we focus on the latter case\nunder a binary Gaussian mixture classification problem. Unlike earlier work, we\naim to derive the natural accuracy gap between the optimal Bayes and\nadversarial classifiers, and study the effect of different distributional\nparameters, namely separation between class centroids, class proportions, and\nthe covariance matrix, on the derived gap. We show that under certain\nconditions, the natural error of the optimal adversarial classifier, as well as\nthe gap, are locally minimized when classes are balanced, contradicting the\nperformance of the Bayes classifier where perfect balance induces the worst\naccuracy. Moreover, we show that with an $\\ell_\\infty$ bounded perturbation and\nan adversarial budget of $\\epsilon$, this gap is $\\Theta(\\epsilon^2)$ for the\nworst-case parameters, which for suitably small $\\epsilon$ indicates the\ntheoretical possibility of achieving robust classifiers with near-perfect\naccuracy, which is rarely reflected in practical algorithms.",

For the OPT's pre-training, we design a multi-task pretext\nlearning scheme to model multi-modal resources from three different data\ngranularities, \\ie, token-, modality-, and sample-level modeling, through which\nOPT learns to align and translate among different modalities. The pre-training\ntask is carried out on a large amount of image-text-audio triplets from Open\nImages.

We prove that, under this condition, Riemannian covering\nequivalence is the same as isospectrality of finitely many twisted Laplacians\non the manifolds, acting on sections of flat bundles corresponding to specific\nrepresentations of the fundamental groups of the manifolds involved. Using the\nsame methods, we provide spectral criteria for weak conjugacy and strong\nisospectrality. In the negative curvature case, we formulate an analogue of our\nresult for the length spectrum. The proofs are inspired by number-theoretical\nanalogues. We study examples where the representation theoretic condition does\nand does not hold.

This will bring\na critical challenge for learning: given the increasing data volume or the\nnumber of classes, one has to instantaneously adjust the neural model capacity\nto obtain promising performance. Existing methods either ignore the growing\nnature of data or seek to independently search an optimal architecture for a\ngiven dataset, and thus are incapable of promptly adjusting the architectures\nfor the changed data. To address this, we present a neural architecture\nadaptation method, namely Adaptation eXpert (AdaXpert), to efficiently adjust\nprevious architectures on the growing data. Specifically, we introduce an\narchitecture adjuster to generate a suitable architecture for each data\nsnapshot, based on the previous architecture and the different extent between\ncurrent and previous data distributions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptation\ncondition to determine the necessity of adjustment, thereby avoiding\nunnecessary and time-consuming adjustments.

These systems are normally considered to be experimental\nrealizations of single band Hubbard models and their properties are mostly\ninvestigated using lattice models with frozen structural degrees of freedom,\nalthough the reliability of this approximation is unclear. Here, we consider\nthe case of Pb/Ge(111) at 1/3 coverage, for which surface X-ray diffraction and\nARPES data are available. By performing first principles calculations, we\ndemonstrate that the non-local exchange between Pb and the substrate drives the\nsystem into a $3\\times 3$ charge density wave. The electronic structure of this\ncharge ordered phase is mainly determined by two effects: the magnitude of the\nPb distortion and the large spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we show that the\neffect applies also to the $3\\times 3$ phase of Pb/Si(111) where the\nPb-substrate exchange interaction increases the bandwidth by more than a factor\n1.5 with respect to DFT+U, in better agreement with STS data.

Here we suggest that data obtained from\nanother technology, radioactive decays, might provide new insights into the\norigin of signals previously seen in neutrino detectors and gravity wave\ndetectors. On August 17, 2017, at 12h41m UT, the GW170817 signal was detected\nby LIGO and Virgo.

We show that the Si/Cl signal is\nunexpectedly similar to the six-hour signal from SN1987A. In addition, we\nestablish that the sources of the coinciding events are similar to those of the\nSi/Cl signal.

      "abstract": "The dynamical response of an aircraft subject to gust perturbations is a key\nelement in a preliminary design phase. In particular, the loads induced by\ngusts along the wing should not exceed some limit values and should even\nideally be decreased. Active control is one lever to address this problem.\nHowever, evaluating the benefit that active control may bring considering some\nactuators characteristics or some delay in the loop is a difficult task,\nespecially in the early design phase. This problem is addressed in this paper\nwith an open-loop optimal control framework and more specifically with a direct\ntranscription method resulting in a linear optimisation problem. The approach\nis illustrated on a realistic aeroelastic aircraft model built with a coupled\nfluid-structure solver which order is reduced to decrease the number of\noptimisation variables.",

      "abstract": "In the last twenty years, there have been significant advances in the study\nof the blow-up phenomenon for the critical generalized Korteweg-de Vries\nequation, including the determination of sufficient conditions for blowup, the\nstability of blowup in a refined topology and the classification of minimal\nmass blowup. Exotic blow-up solutions with a continuum of blow-up rates and\nmulti-point blow-up solutions were also constructed. However, all these\nresults, as well as numerical simulations, involve the bubbling of a solitary\nwave going at infinity at the blow-up time, which means that the blow-up\ndynamics and the residue are eventually uncoupled. Even at the formal level,\nthere was no indication whether blowup at a finite point could occur for this\nequation. In this article, we answer this question by constructing solutions\nthat blow up in finite time under the form of a single-bubble concentrating the\nground state at a finite point with an unforeseen blow-up rate. Finding a\nblow-up rate intermediate between the self-similar rate and other rates\npreviously known also reopens the question of which blow-up rates are actually\npossible for this equation.",

Overall, the proposed methods achieved the\nbest average scores for each respective round in the challenge, with TriUNet\nbeing the winning model in Round I and DivergentNets being the winning model in\nRound II of the segmentation generalization challenge at EndoCV 2021.

Different from existing public datasets, iMiGUE\nfocuses on nonverbal body gestures without using any identity information,\nwhile the predominant researches of emotion analysis concern sensitive\nbiometric data, like face and speech. Most importantly, iMiGUE focuses on\nmicro-gestures, i.e., unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings, which\nare different from ordinary scope of gestures from other gesture datasets which\nare mostly intentionally performed for illustrative purposes. Furthermore,\niMiGUE is designed to evaluate the ability of models to analyze the emotional\nstates by integrating information of recognized micro-gesture, rather than just\nrecognizing prototypes in the sequences separately (or isolatedly). This is\nbecause the real need for emotion AI is to understand the emotional states\nbehind gestures in a holistic way. Moreover, to counter for the challenge of\nimbalanced sample distribution of this dataset, an unsupervised learning method\nis proposed to capture latent representations from the micro-gesture sequences\nthemselves. We systematically investigate representative methods on this\ndataset, and comprehensive experimental results reveal several interesting\ninsights from the iMiGUE, e.g., micro-gesture-based analysis can promote\nemotion understanding.

Minor passivation drops limit the functioning of solar cells,\nhowever, they are not detected in devices with open-circuit voltages below 700\nmV. In this work, simulations and experiments were used to show the effect of\nlocalized surface defects on the overall device performance. Although the\ndefects did not significantly affect lifetime measurements prior to electrode\ndeposition or open-circuit voltage measurements at standard-test conditions, it\nhad a significant impact on the point of operation and, in turn, device\nefficiency (up to several percent efficiency drop). Furthermore, this study\ndemonstrates that localized defects can have a detrimental effect on\nwell-passivated areas located several centimeters away through electrical\nconnection by the electrode. This leads to a low-injection lifetime drop after\nelectrode deposition. Thus, commonly measured lifetime curves before\nmetallization (and therefore internal voltage) are usually not representative\nof their respective values after metallization. The low-injection lifetime drop\noften observed after electrode deposition can derive from such local surface\ndefects, and not from a homogeneous passivation drop.",

      "abstract": "Motivation: A Chemical Reaction Network (CRN) is a set of chemical reactions,\nwhich can be very complex and difficult to analyze. Indeed, dynamical\nproperties of CRNs can be described by a set of non-linear differential\nequations that rarely can be solved in closed-form, but that can instead be\nused to reason on the system dynamics. In this context, one of the possible\napproaches is to perform numerical simulations, which may require a high\ncomputational effort. In particular, in order to investigate some dynamical\nproperties, such as robustness or global sensitivity, many simulations have to\nbe performed by varying the initial concentration of chemical species. Results:\nIn order to reduce the computational effort required when many simulations are\nneeded to assess a property, we exploit a new notion of monotonicity of the\noutput of the system (the concentration of a target chemical species at the\nsteady-state) with respect to the input (the initial concentration of another\nchemical species). To assess such monotonicity behavior, we propose a new\ngraphical approach that allows us to state sufficient conditions for ensuring\nthat the monotonicity property holds. Our sufficient conditions allow us to\nefficiently verify the monotonicity property by exploring a graph constructed\non the basis of the reactions involved in the network. Once established, our\nmonotonicity property allows us to drastically reduce the number of simulations\nrequired to assess some dynamical properties of the CRN.",

We show that, although light exposure\nsystematicallyimproves solar cell efficiency in the case of devices using\nintrinsic and p-type layers with optimal thickness, this treatment leads to\nperformance degradation for devices with an insufficiently thick (p) layer on\nthe light-incoming side. Our results indicate that this degradation is caused\nby a diminution of the (i/p)-layer stack hole-selectivity because of light\nexposure. Degradation is avoided when a sufficiently thick (p) layer is used,\nor when exposure of the (p) layer to UV light is avoided, as is the case of the\nrear-junction configuration, commonly used in the industry. Additionally,\napplying a forward bias current or an infrared light exposure results in an\nefficiency increase for all investigated solar cells, independently of the\n(p)-layer thickness, confirming the beneficial influence of recombination on\nthe performance of silicon heterojunction solar cells.",

      "abstract": "The high interstellar abundances of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)\nand their size distribution are the result of complex chemical processes\nimplying dust, UV radiation, and the main gaseous components (H, C+, and O).\nThese processes must explain the high abundance of relatively small PAHs in the\ndiffuse interstellar medium (ISM) and imply the continuous formation of some\nPAHs that are small enough (number of carbon atoms NC <~ 35-50) to be\ncompletely dehydrogenated by interstellar UV radiation. The carbon clusters Cn\nthus formed are constantly exposed to the absorption of ~10-13.6 eV UV photons,\nallowing isomerization and favoring the formation of the most stable isomers.\nThey might tend to form irregular carbon cages. The frequent accretion of\ninterstellar C+ ions could favor further cage isomerization, as is known in the\nlaboratory for C60, possibly yielding most stable fullerenes, such as C40, C44,\nand C50. These fullerenes are expected to be very stable in the diffuse ISM\nbecause C2 ejection is not possible by single UV photon absorption, but could\nneed rare two-photon absorption. It is possible that at least one of these\nfullerenes or its cation is as abundant as C60 or C60+ in the diffuse ISM,\nalthough this abundance is limited by the lack of observed matching features in\nobserved mid-infrared spectra. B3LYP calculations of the visible spectrum for a\nnumber of fullerene isomers with 40 <~ NC <~ 50 show that they generally have a\nfew spectral bands in the visible range, with f-values in the range of a few\n10-2.

It is shown that the use of strain energy\ndensity that is quadratic in the gradient of elastic deformation results in\nnon-singular stresses but may result in singular driving forces, whereas a\nstrain energy, which is quadratic in the gradient of the full deformation\ntensor, regularizes both stresses and driving forces for the order parameter\nand is therefore a suitable choice.

      "title": "Leveraging Domain Agnostic and Specific Knowledge for Acronym\n  Disambiguation",
      "abstract": "An obstacle to scientific document understanding is the extensive use of\nacronyms which are shortened forms of long technical phrases. Acronym\ndisambiguation aims to find the correct meaning of an ambiguous acronym in a\ngiven text. Recent efforts attempted to incorporate word embeddings and deep\nlearning architectures, and achieved significant effects in this task. In\ngeneral domains, kinds of fine-grained pretrained language models have sprung\nup, thanks to the largescale corpora which can usually be obtained through\ncrowdsourcing. However, these models based on domain agnostic knowledge might\nachieve insufficient performance when directly applied to the scientific\ndomain. Moreover, obtaining large-scale high-quality annotated data and\nrepresenting high-level semantics in the scientific domain is challenging and\nexpensive. In this paper, we consider both the domain agnostic and specific\nknowledge, and propose a Hierarchical Dual-path BERT method coined hdBERT to\ncapture the general fine-grained and high-level specific representations for\nacronym disambiguation. First, the context-based pretrained models, RoBERTa and\nSciBERT, are elaborately involved in encoding these two kinds of knowledge\nrespectively. Second, multiple layer perceptron is devised to integrate the\ndualpath representations simultaneously and outputs the prediction. With a\nwidely adopted SciAD dataset contained 62,441 sentences, we investigate the\neffectiveness of hdBERT. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art methods among various evaluation metrics.\nSpecifically, its macro F1 achieves 93.73%.",

      "abstract": "White dwarfs which exhibit transit signatures of planetary debris and\naccreted planetary material provide exceptional opportunities to probe the\nmaterial composition and dynamical structure of planetary systems. Although\nprevious theoretical work investigating the role of minor body disruption\naround white dwarfs has focussed on spherical bodies, Solar System asteroids\ncan be more accurately modelled as triaxial ellipsoids. Here we present an\nanalytical framework to identify the type of disruption (tidal fragmentation,\ntotal sublimation or direct impact) experienced by triaxial asteroids\napproaching white dwarfs on extremely eccentric (e \\sim 1) orbits. This\nframework is then used to identify the outcomes for simplified Main belt\nanalogues of 100 bodies across five different white dwarf temperatures. We also\npresent an empirical relationship between cooling age and effective temperature\nfor both DA and DB white dwarfs to identify the age of the white dwarfs\nconsidered here. We find that using a purely spherical shape model can\nunderestimate the physical size and radial distance at which an asteroid is\nsubjected to complete sublimation, and these differences increase with greater\nelongation of the body. Contrastingly, fragmentation always occurs in the\nlargest semi-axis of a body and so can be modelled by a sphere of that radius.\nBoth fragmentation and sublimation are greatly affected by the body's material\ncomposition, and hence by the composition of their progenitor asteroid belts.\nThe white dwarf temperature, and hence cooling age, can affect the expected\ndebris distribution: higher temperatures sublimate large elongated asteroids,\nand cooler temperatures accommodate more direct impacts.",

To tackle the domain-shift which exists under the UDA setting, we\nfirst exploited a recent Domain Generalization (DG) technique, called Relative\nNorm Alignment (RNA). It consists in designing a model able to generalize well\nto any unseen domain, regardless of the possibility to access target data at\ntraining time. Then, in a second phase, we extended the approach to work on\nunlabelled target data, allowing the model to adapt to the target distribution\nin an unsupervised fashion. For this purpose, we included in our framework\nexisting UDA algorithms, such as Temporal Attentive Adversarial Adaptation\nNetwork (TA3N), jointly with new multi-stream consistency losses, namely\nTemporal Hard Norm Alignment (T-HNA) and Min-Entropy Consistency (MEC).

      "title": "Policy Transfer across Visual and Dynamics Domain Gaps via Iterative\n  Grounding",
      "abstract": "The ability to transfer a policy from one environment to another is a\npromising avenue for efficient robot learning in realistic settings where task\nsupervision is not available. This can allow us to take advantage of\nenvironments well suited for training, such as simulators or laboratories, to\nlearn a policy for a real robot in a home or office. To succeed, such policy\ntransfer must overcome both the visual domain gap (e.g. different illumination\nor background) and the dynamics domain gap (e.g. different robot calibration or\nmodelling error) between source and target environments. However, prior policy\ntransfer approaches either cannot handle a large domain gap or can only address\none type of domain gap at a time. In this paper, we propose a novel policy\ntransfer method with iterative \"environment grounding\", IDAPT, that alternates\nbetween (1) directly minimizing both visual and dynamics domain gaps by\ngrounding the source environment in the target environment domains, and (2)\ntraining a policy on the grounded source environment. This iterative training\nprogressively aligns the domains between the two environments and adapts the\npolicy to the target environment. Once trained, the policy can be directly\nexecuted on the target environment. The empirical results on locomotion and\nrobotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our approach can effectively\ntransfer a policy across visual and dynamics domain gaps with minimal\nsupervision and interaction with the target environment.

This paper studies a novel AI based spectrum sharing and energy\nharvesting system in which the freshness of information (AoI) is guaranteed.\nThe system includes a primary user with access rights to the spectrum and a\nsecondary user. The secondary user is an energy harvesting sensor that intends\nto use the primary user spectrum opportunistically. The problem is formulated\nas partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and solved using two\nmethods: a deep Q-network (DQN) and dueling double deep Q-Network (D3QN) to\nachieve the optimal policy. The purpose is to choose the best action adaptively\nin every time slot based on its situation in both overlay and underlay modes to\nminimize the average AoI of the secondary user. Finally, simulation experiments\nare performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to\nthe overlay mode. According to the results, the average AoI in the proposed\nsystem is less than that of the existing models, including only overlay mode.\nThe average user access improved from 30% in the overlay mode to 45% in the DQN\nand 48% in the D3QN.",

      "abstract": "Signomials are obtained by generalizing polynomials to allow for arbitrary\nreal exponents. This generalization offers great expressive power, but has\nhistorically sacrificed the organizing principle of ``degree'' that is central\nto polynomial optimization theory. We reclaim that principle here through the\nconcept of signomial rings, which we use to derive complete convex relaxation\nhierarchies of upper and lower bounds for signomial optimization via sums of\narithmetic-geometric exponentials (SAGE) nonnegativity certificates. The\nPositivstellensatz underlying the lower bounds relies on the concept of\nconditional SAGE and removes regularity conditions required by earlier works,\nsuch as convexity and Archimedeanity of the feasible set. Through worked\nexamples we illustrate the practicality of this hierarchy in areas such as\nchemical reaction network theory and chemical engineering. These examples\ninclude comparisons to direct global solvers (e.g., BARON and ANTIGONE) and the\nLasserre hierarchy (where appropriate). The completeness of our hierarchy of\nupper bounds follows from a generic construction whereby a Positivstellensatz\nfor signomial nonnegativity over a compact set provides for arbitrarily strong\nouter approximations of the corresponding cone of nonnegative signomials. While\nworking toward that result, we prove basic facts on the existence and\nuniqueness of solutions to signomial moment problems.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a model of competing agents in a prophet setting, where rewards\narrive online, and decisions are made immediately and irrevocably. The rewards\nare unknown from the outset, but they are drawn from a known probability\ndistribution. In the standard prophet setting, a single agent makes selection\ndecisions in an attempt to maximize her expected reward. The novelty of our\nmodel is the introduction of a competition setting, where multiple agents\ncompete over the arriving rewards, and make online selection decisions\nsimultaneously, as rewards arrive. If a given reward is selected by more than a\nsingle agent, ties are broken either randomly or by a fixed ranking of the\nagents. The consideration of competition turns the prophet setting from an\nonline decision making scenario to a multi-agent game.\n  For both random and ranked tie-breaking rules, we present simple threshold\nstrategies for the agents that give them high guarantees, independent of the\nstrategies taken by others. In particular, for random tie-breaking, every agent\ncan guarantee herself at least $\\frac{1}{k+1}$ of the highest reward, and at\nleast $\\frac{1}{2k}$ of the optimal social welfare. For ranked tie-breaking,\nthe $i$th ranked agent can guarantee herself at least a half of the $i$th\nhighest reward. We complement these results by matching upper bounds, even with\nrespect to equilibrium profiles. For ranked tie-breaking rule, we also show a\ncorrespondence between the equilibrium of the $k$-agent game and the optimal\nstrategy of a single decision maker who can select up to $k$ rewards.",

      "abstract": "Telerobotic systems must adapt to new environmental conditions and deal with\nhigh uncertainty caused by long-time delays. As one of the best alternatives to\nhuman-level intelligence, Reinforcement Learning (RL) may offer a solution to\ncope with these issues. This paper proposes to integrate RL with the Model\nMediated Teleoperation (MMT) concept. The teleoperator interacts with a\nsimulated virtual environment, which provides instant feedback. Whereas\nfeedback from the real environment is delayed, feedback from the model is\ninstantaneous, leading to high transparency. The MMT is realized in combination\nwith an intelligent system with two layers. The first layer utilizes Dynamic\nMovement Primitives (DMP) which accounts for certain changes in the avatar\nenvironment. And, the second layer addresses the problems caused by uncertainty\nin the model using RL methods. Augmented reality was also provided to fuse the\navatar device and virtual environment models for the teleoperator. Implemented\non DLR's Exodex Adam hand-arm haptic exoskeleton, the results show RL methods\nare able to find different solutions when changes are applied to the object\nposition after the demonstration. The results also show DMPs to be effective at\nadapting to new conditions where there is no uncertainty involved.",

      "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become de fact state-of-the-art for\nthe main computer vision tasks. However, due to the complex underlying\nstructure their decisions are hard to understand which limits their use in some\ncontext of the industrial world. A common and hard to detect challenge in\nmachine learning (ML) tasks is data bias. In this work, we present a systematic\napproach to uncover data bias by means of attribution maps. For this purpose,\nfirst an artificial dataset with a known bias is created and used to train\nintentionally biased CNNs. The networks' decisions are then inspected using\nattribution maps. Finally, meaningful metrics are used to measure the\nattribution maps' representativeness with respect to the known bias. The\nproposed study shows that some attribution map techniques highlight the\npresence of bias in the data better than others and metrics can support the\nidentification of bias.",

      "abstract": "We consider the coded caching problem with shared caches where several users\nshare a cache, but each user has access to only a single cache. For this\nnetwork, the fundamental limits of coded caching are known for centralized and\ndecentralized settings under uncoded placement. In the centralized case, to\nachieve the gains offered by coded caching, one requires a sub-packetization\nwhich increases exponentially with the number of caches. The dedicated cache\nnetworks had a similar issue, and placement delivery arrays (PDAs) were\nintroduced as a solution to it. Using the PDA framework, we propose a procedure\nto obtain new coded caching schemes for shared caches with lower\nsub-packetization requirements. The advantage of this procedure is that we can\ntransform all the existing PDA structures into coded caching schemes for shared\ncaches, thus resulting in low sub-packetization schemes. We also show that the\noptimal scheme given by Parrinello, Unsal and Elia (Fundamental Limits of Coded\nCaching with Multiple Antennas, Shared Caches and Uncoded Prefetching) can be\nrecovered using a Maddah-Ali Niesen PDA.",

While a single drone can be guided by a human\noperator, the deployment of a swarm of multiple drones requires proper\nalgorithms for automatic task-oriented control. In this paper, we focus on\nvisual coverage optimization with drone-mounted camera sensors.

      "abstract": "The incremental poses computed through odometry can be integrated over time\nto calculate the pose of a device with respect to an initial location. The\nresulting global pose may be used to formulate a second, consistency based,\nloss term in a deep odometry setting. In such cases where multiple losses are\nimposed on a network, the uncertainty over each output can be derived to weigh\nthe different loss terms in a maximum likelihood setting. However, when\nimposing a constraint on the integrated transformation, due to how only\nodometry is estimated at each iteration of the algorithm, there is no\ninformation about the uncertainty associated with the global pose to weigh the\nglobal loss term. In this paper, we associate uncertainties with the output\nposes of a deep odometry network and propagate the uncertainties through each\niteration. Our goal is to use the estimated covariance matrix at each\nincremental step to weigh the loss at the corresponding step while weighting\nthe global loss term using the compounded uncertainty. This formulation\nprovides an adaptive method to weigh the incremental and integrated loss terms\nagainst each other, noting the increase in uncertainty as new estimates arrive.\nWe provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of pose estimates and show\nthat our method surpasses the accuracy of the state-of-the-art Visual Odometry\napproaches. Then, uncertainty estimates are evaluated and comparisons against\nfixed baselines are provided. Finally, the uncertainty values are used in a\nrealistic example to show the effectiveness of uncertainty quantification for\nlocalization.",

Despite their\nhigh in-distribution accuracy, these models suffer from two issues: high\ntraining cost and low out-of-distribution accuracy.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of\nensemble learning approach to improve generalization of MRC systems without\nretraining a big model. After separately training the base models with\ndifferent structures on different datasets, they are ensembled using weighting\nand stacking approaches in probabilistic and non-probabilistic settings. Three\nconfigurations are investigated including heterogeneous, homogeneous, and\nhybrid on eight datasets and six state-of-the-art models. We identify the\nimportant factors in the effectiveness of ensemble methods. Also, we compare\nthe robustness of ensemble and fine-tuned models against data distribution\nshifts. The experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of the\nensemble approach in improving the out-of-distribution accuracy of MRC systems,\nespecially when the base models are similar in accuracies.",

In this paper, a two-stage genetic\nalgorithm (GA) is proposed to design a new set of user-specific,\nnon-orthogonal, unimodular sequences for uplink grant-free access. The\nfirst-stage GA is to find a subsampling index set for a partial unitary matrix\nthat can be approximated to an equiangular tight frame. Then in the\nsecond-stage GA, we try to find a sequence to be masked to each column of the\npartial unitary matrix, in order to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio of\nthe resulting columns for multicarrier transmission. Finally, the masked\ncolumns of the matrix are proposed as new non-orthogonal sequences for uplink\ngrant-free access. Simulation results demonstrate that the non-orthogonal\nsequences designed by our two-stage GA exhibit excellent performance for\ncompressed sensing based joint activity detection and channel estimation in\nuplink grant-free access.

      "title": "DECAF: Deep Extreme Classification with Label Features",
      "abstract": "Extreme multi-label classification (XML) involves tagging a data point with\nits most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set, with\nseveral applications such as product-to-product recommendation with millions of\nproducts. Although leading XML algorithms scale to millions of labels, they\nlargely ignore label meta-data such as textual descriptions of the labels. On\nthe other hand, classical techniques that can utilize label metadata via\nrepresentation learning using deep networks struggle in extreme settings. This\npaper develops the DECAF algorithm that addresses these challenges by learning\nmodels enriched by label metadata that jointly learn model parameters and\nfeature representations using deep networks and offer accurate classification\nat the scale of millions of labels. DECAF makes specific contributions to model\narchitecture design, initialization, and training, enabling it to offer up to\n2-6% more accurate prediction than leading extreme classifiers on publicly\navailable benchmark product-to-product recommendation datasets, such as\nLF-AmazonTitles-1.3M. At the same time, DECAF was found to be up to 22x faster\nat inference than leading deep extreme classifiers, which makes it suitable for\nreal-time applications that require predictions within a few milliseconds. The\ncode for DECAF is available at the following URL\nhttps://github.com/Extreme-classification/DECAF.",

      "abstract": "Panel-based, kernel-split quadrature is currently one of the most efficient\nmethods available for accurate evaluation of singular and nearly singular layer\npotentials in two dimensions. However, it can fail completely for the layer\npotentials belonging to the modified Helmholtz, modified biharmonic and\nmodified Stokes equations. These equations depend on a parameter, denoted\n$\\alpha$, and kernel-split quadrature loses its accuracy rapidly when this\nparameter grows beyond a certain threshold. This paper describes an algorithm\nthat remedies this problem, using per-target adaptive sampling of the source\ngeometry. The refinement is carried out through recursive bisection, with a\ncarefully selected rule set. This maintains accuracy for a wide range of the\nparameter $\\alpha$, at an increased cost that scales as $\\log \\alpha$. Using\nthis algorithm allows kernel-split quadrature to be both accurate and efficient\nfor a much wider range of problems than previously possible.",

      "abstract": "Facial landmarks (FLM) estimation is a critical component in many\nface-related applications. In this work, we aim to optimize for both accuracy\nand speed and explore the trade-off between them. Our key observation is that\nnot all faces are created equal. Frontal faces with neutral expressions\nconverge faster than faces with extreme poses or expressions. To differentiate\namong samples, we train our model to predict the regression error after each\niteration. If the current iteration is accurate enough, we stop iterating,\nsaving redundant iterations while keeping the accuracy in check. We also\nobserve that as neighboring patches overlap, we can infer all facial landmarks\n(FLMs) with only a small number of patches without a major accuracy sacrifice.\nArchitecturally, we offer a multi-scale, patch-based, lightweight feature\nextractor with a fine-grained local patch attention module, which computes a\npatch weighting according to the information in the patch itself and enhances\nthe expressive power of the patch features. We analyze the patch attention data\nto infer where the model is attending when regressing facial landmarks and\ncompare it to face attention in humans. Our model runs in real-time on a mobile\ndevice GPU, with 95 Mega Multiply-Add (MMA) operations, outperforming all\nstate-of-the-art methods under 1000 MMA, with a normalized mean error of 8.16\non the 300W challenging dataset.",

      "abstract": "The surprisingness of a song is an essential and seemingly subjective factor\nin determining whether the listener likes it. With the help of information\ntheory, it can be described as the transition probability of a music sequence\nmodeled as a Markov chain. In this study, we introduce the concept of deriving\nentropy variations over time, so that the surprise contour of each chord\nsequence can be extracted. Based on this, we propose a user-controllable\nframework that uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to harmonize\nthe melody based on the given chord surprise indication. Through explicit\nconditions, the model can randomly generate various and harmonic chord\nprogressions for a melody, and the Spearman's correlation and p-value\nsignificance show that the resulting chord progressions match the given\nsurprise contour quite well. The vanilla CVAE model was evaluated in a basic\nmelody harmonization task (no surprise control) in terms of six objective\nmetrics. The results of experiments on the Hooktheory Lead Sheet Dataset show\nthat our model achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art melody\nharmonization model.",

      "abstract": "When confronted with objects of unknown types in an image, humans can\neffortlessly and precisely tell their visual boundaries. This recognition\nmechanism and underlying generalization capability seem to contrast to\nstate-of-the-art image segmentation networks that rely on large-scale\ncategory-aware annotated training samples. In this paper, we make an attempt\ntowards building models that explicitly account for visual boundary knowledge,\nin hope to reduce the training effort on segmenting unseen categories.\nSpecifically, we investigate a new task termed as Boundary Knowledge\nTranslation (BKT). Given a set of fully labeled categories, BKT aims to\ntranslate the visual boundary knowledge learned from the labeled categories, to\na set of novel categories, each of which is provided only a few labeled\nsamples. To this end, we propose a Translation Segmentation Network\n(Trans-Net), which comprises a segmentation network and two boundary\ndiscriminators. The segmentation network, combined with a boundary-aware\nself-supervised mechanism, is devised to conduct foreground segmentation, while\nthe two discriminators work together in an adversarial manner to ensure an\naccurate segmentation of the novel categories under light supervision.\nExhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with only tens of labeled samples as\nguidance, Trans-Net achieves close results on par with fully supervised\nmethods.",

      "title": "Edge-competing Pathological Liver Vessel Segmentation with Limited\n  Labels",
      "abstract": "The microvascular invasion (MVI) is a major prognostic factor in\nhepatocellular carcinoma, which is one of the malignant tumors with the highest\nmortality rate. The diagnosis of MVI needs discovering the vessels that contain\nhepatocellular carcinoma cells and counting their number in each vessel, which\ndepends heavily on experiences of the doctor, is largely subjective and\ntime-consuming. However, there is no algorithm as yet tailored for the MVI\ndetection from pathological images. This paper collects the first pathological\nliver image dataset containing 522 whole slide images with labels of vessels,\nMVI, and hepatocellular carcinoma grades. The first and essential step for the\nautomatic diagnosis of MVI is the accurate segmentation of vessels. The unique\ncharacteristics of pathological liver images, such as super-large size,\nmulti-scale vessel, and blurred vessel edges, make the accurate vessel\nsegmentation challenging. Based on the collected dataset, we propose an\nEdge-competing Vessel Segmentation Network (EVS-Net), which contains a\nsegmentation network and two edge segmentation discriminators. The segmentation\nnetwork, combined with an edge-aware self-supervision mechanism, is devised to\nconduct vessel segmentation with limited labeled patches. Meanwhile, two\ndiscriminators are introduced to distinguish whether the segmented vessel and\nbackground contain residual features in an adversarial manner. In the training\nstage, two discriminators are devised tocompete for the predicted position of\nedges. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with only limited labeled\npatches, EVS-Net achieves a close performance of fully supervised methods,\nwhich provides a convenient tool for the pathological liver vessel\nsegmentation.

      "abstract": "Despite recent progress on image-based virtual try-on, current methods are\nconstraint by shared warping networks and thus fail to synthesize natural\ntry-on results when faced with clothing categories that require different\nwarping operations. In this paper, we address this problem by finding clothing\ncategory-specific warping networks for the virtual try-on task via Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS). We introduce a NAS-Warping Module and elaborately\ndesign a bilevel hierarchical search space to identify the optimal\nnetwork-level and operation-level flow estimation architecture. Given the\nnetwork-level search space, containing different numbers of warping blocks, and\nthe operation-level search space with different convolution operations, we\njointly learn a combination of repeatable warping cells and convolution\noperations specifically for the clothing-person alignment. Moreover, a\nNAS-Fusion Module is proposed to synthesize more natural final try-on results,\nwhich is realized by leveraging particular skip connections to produce\nbetter-fused features that are required for seamlessly fusing the warped\nclothing and the unchanged person part. We adopt an efficient and stable\none-shot searching strategy to search the above two modules. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our WAS-VTON significantly outperforms the\nprevious fixed-architecture try-on methods with more natural warping results\nand virtual try-on results.",

Our proposed framework\nspans MPM discretizations from total Lagrangian formulations to Eulerian\nformulations. We design an easy-to-implement physics-based criterion that\nallows A-ULMPM to update the reference configuration adaptively for measuring\nphysical states including stress, strain, interpolation kernels and their\nderivatives. For better efficiency and conservation of angular momentum, we\nfurther integrate the APIC[Jiang et al. 2015] and MLS-MPM[Hu et al. 2018]\nformulations in A-ULMPM by augmenting the accuracy of velocity rasterization\nusing both the local velocity and its first-order derivatives. Our theoretical\nderivations use a nodal discretized Lagrangian, instead of the weak form\ndiscretization in MLS-MPM[Hu et al. 2018], and naturally lead to a \"modified\"\nMLS-MPM in A-ULMPM, which can recover MLS-MPM using a completely Eulerian\nformulation. A-ULMPM does not require significant changes to traditional\nEulerian formulations of MPM, and is computationally more efficient since it\nonly updates interpolation kernels and their derivatives when large topology\nchanges occur. We present end-to-end 3D simulations of stretching and twisting\nhyperelastic solids, splashing liquids, and multi-material interactions with\nlarge deformations to demonstrate the efficacy of our novel A-ULMPM framework.",

      "abstract": "Latest CNN-based object detection models are quite accurate but require a\nhigh-performance GPU to run in real-time. They still are heavy in terms of\nmemory size and speed for an embedded system with limited memory space. Since\nthe object detection for autonomous system is run on an embedded processor, it\nis preferable to compress the detection network as light as possible while\npreserving the detection accuracy. There are several popular lightweight\ndetection models but their accuracy is too low for safe driving applications.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a new object detection model, referred as\nYOffleNet, which is compressed at a high ratio while minimizing the accuracy\nloss for real-time and safe driving application on an autonomous system. The\nbackbone network architecture is based on YOLOv4, but we could compress the\nnetwork greatly by replacing the high-calculation-load CSP DenseNet with the\nlighter modules of ShuffleNet. Experiments with KITTI dataset showed that the\nproposed YOffleNet is compressed by 4.7 times than the YOLOv4-s that could\nachieve as fast as 46 FPS on an embedded GPU system(NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier).\nCompared to the high compression ratio, the accuracy is reduced slightly to\n85.8% mAP, that is only 2.6% lower than YOLOv4-s. Thus, the proposed network\nshowed a high potential to be deployed on the embedded system of the autonomous\nsystem for the real-time and accurate object detection applications.",

In this paper, we analyze the\nweaknesses of current methods and propose an Object-to-Scene (OTS) method,\nwhich extracts object features and learns object relations to recognize indoor\nscenes. The proposed OTS first extracts object features based on the\nsegmentation network and the proposed object feature aggregation module (OFAM).\nAfterwards, the object relations are calculated and the scene representation is\nconstructed based on the proposed object attention module (OAM) and global\nrelation aggregation module (GRAM). The final results in this work show that\nOTS successfully extracts object features and learns object relations from the\nsegmentation network. Moreover, OTS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by\nmore than 2\\% on indoor scene recognition without using any additional streams.\nCode is publicly available at: https://github.com/FreeformRobotics/OTS.",

Transformer\nhas succeeded in capturing semantic features, but it uses position encoding to\ncapture sequence features, which has great shortcomings compared with the\nrecurrent model. In this paper, we propose T-E-GRU for Chinese sentiment\nanalysis, which combine transformer encoder and GRU. We conducted experiments\non three Chinese comment datasets. In view of the confusion of punctuation\nmarks in Chinese comment texts, we selectively retain some punctuation marks\nwith sentence segmentation ability. The experimental results show that T-E-GRU\noutperforms classic recurrent model and recurrent model with attention.",

      "title": "Style Curriculum Learning for Robust Medical Image Segmentation",
      "abstract": "The performance of deep segmentation models often degrades due to\ndistribution shifts in image intensities between the training and test data\nsets. This is particularly pronounced in multi-centre studies involving data\nacquired using multi-vendor scanners, with variations in acquisition protocols.\nIt is challenging to address this degradation because the shift is often not\nknown \\textit{a priori} and hence difficult to model. We propose a novel\nframework to ensure robust segmentation in the presence of such distribution\nshifts. Our contribution is three-fold. First, inspired by the spirit of\ncurriculum learning, we design a novel style curriculum to train the\nsegmentation models using an easy-to-hard mode. A style transfer model with\nstyle fusion is employed to generate the curriculum samples. Gradually focusing\non complex and adversarial style samples can significantly boost the robustness\nof the models. Second, instead of subjectively defining the curriculum\ncomplexity, we adopt an automated gradient manipulation method to control the\nhard and adversarial sample generation process. Third, we propose the Local\nGradient Sign strategy to aggregate the gradient locally and stabilise training\nduring gradient manipulation. The proposed framework can generalise to unknown\ndistribution without using any target data. Extensive experiments on the public\nM\\&Ms Challenge dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework can generalise\ndeep models well to unknown distributions and achieve significant improvements\nin segmentation accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Various networks such as cloud computing, water/gas/electricity networks,\nwireless sensor networks, transportation networks, and 4G/5G networks, have\nbecome an integral part of our daily lives. A binary-state network (BN) is\noften used to model network structures and applications. The BN reliability is\nthe probability that a BN functions continuously; that is, that there is always\na simple path connected between a specific pair of nodes. This metric is a\npopular index for designing, managing, controlling, and evaluating networks.\nThe traditional BN reliability assumes that the reliability of each arc is\nknown in advance. However, this is not always the case. Functioning components\noperate under different environments; moreover, a network might have newly\ninstalled components. Hence, the reliability of these components is not always\nknown. To resolve the aforementioned problems, in which the reliability of some\ncomponents of a network are uncertain, we introduce the fuzzy concept for the\nanalysis of these components, and propose a new algorithm to solve this\nuncertainty-component BN reliability problem. The time complexity of the\nproposed algorithm is analyzed, and the superior performance of the algorithm\nis demonstrated through examples.",

Here, we quantify the statistics of cellular neighborhoods of two\ndifferent multicellular eukaryotes: lab-evolved \"snowflake\" yeast and the green\nalga $Volvox~carteri$. We find that despite large differences in cellular\norganization, the free space associated with individual cells in both organisms\nclosely fits a modified gamma distribution, consistent with maximum entropy\npredictions originally developed for granular materials. This 'entropic'\ncellular packing ensures a degree of predictability despite noise, facilitating\nparent-offspring fidelity even in the absence of developmental regulation.\nTogether with simulations of diverse growth morphologies, these results suggest\nthat gamma-distributed cell neighborhood sizes are a general feature of\nmulticellularity, arising from conserved statistics of cellular packing.",

The final camera will be capable of GHz sampling and provide a field of\nview of 8 degrees with its 265 modules of 7 photomultiplier each (for a total\nof 1855 pixels). In order to validate the performance of NectarCAM, a\npartially-equipped prototype has been constructed consisting of only the inner\n61-modules. It has so far undergone testing at the integration test-bench\nfacility in CEA Paris-Saclay (France) and on a prototype of the MST structure\nin Adlershof (Germany). To characterize the performance of the prototype, Monte\nCarlo simulations were conducted using a detailed model of the 61 module camera\nin the CORSIKA/sim_telarray framework.

It is concluded\nthat the band gaps appear when the divergence of the eigenvalue occurs and the\nveering phenomenon of mode shape begins. The bifurcation of eigenvalues and\nmode shape veering lead to wave attenuation. Hence, the boundary stiffness\nmodulation can be designed to manipulate the band gap where the vibration is\nsuppressed. The contribution of the system parameters to the band gaps has been\nobtained by applying the method of varying amplitudes. By tuning the stiffness,\nthe desired band gap can be obtained and the vibration for specific parameters\ncan be suppressed.

The level-1 VIVT cache becomes\neven simpler to construct if it is implemented as a direct-mapped cache\n(VIVT-DM cache). However, VIVT and VIVT-DM caches have some drawbacks. When the\nnumber of sets in the cache is larger than the smallest page size, there is a\npossibility of synonyms (two or more virtual addresses mapped to the same\nphysical address) existing in the cache. Further, maintenance of cache\ncoherence across multiple processors requires a physical to virtual translation\nmechanism in the hardware. We describe a simple, efficient reverse lookup table\nbased approach to address the synonym and the coherence problems in VIVT (both\nset associative and direct-mapped) caches. In particular, the proposed scheme\ndoes not disturb the critical memory access paths in a typical micro-processor,\nand requires a low overhead for its implementation. We have implemented and\nvalidated the scheme in the AJIT 32-bit microprocessor core (an implementation\nof the SPARC-V8 ISA) and the implementation uses approximately 2% of the gates\nand 5.3% of the memory bits in the processor core.",

      "abstract": "Text style transfer aims to alter the style (e.g., sentiment) of a sentence\nwhile preserving its content. A common approach is to map a given sentence to\ncontent representation that is free of style, and the content representation is\nfed to a decoder with a target style. Previous methods in filtering style\ncompletely remove tokens with style at the token level, which incurs the loss\nof content information. In this paper, we propose to enhance content\npreservation by implicitly removing the style information of each token with\nreverse attention, and thereby retain the content. Furthermore, we fuse content\ninformation when building the target style representation, making it dynamic\nwith respect to the content. Our method creates not only style-independent\ncontent representation, but also content-dependent style representation in\ntransferring style. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines by a large margin in terms of content preservation.\nIn addition, it is also competitive in terms of style transfer accuracy and\nfluency.",

      "abstract": "Cellular operators have begun deploying 5G New Radio (NR) in all available\nbands: low (< 1 GHz), mid (1 - 6 GHz), and high (> 24 GHz) to exploit the\ndifferent capabilities of each. At the same time, traditional 4G Long Term\nEvolution (LTE) deployments are being enhanced with the addition of bands in\nthe unlicensed 5 GHz (using License Assisted Access, or LAA) and the 3.5 GHz\nCitizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) resulting in throughput performance\ncomparable to 5G in mid-band. We present a detailed study comparing 4G and 5G\ndeployments, in all bands in Chicago, and focused mmWave measurements and\nanalysis in Miami. Our methodology, based on commercial and custom apps, is\nscalable for crowdsourcing measurements on a large scale and provides detailed\ndata (throughput, latency, signal strength, etc.) on actual deployments. Our\nmain conclusions based on the measurements are (i) optimized 4G networks in\nmid-band are comparable in both throughput and latency to current deployments\nof 5G (both standalone (SA) and non-standalone (NSA)) and (ii) mmWave 5G, even\nin NSA mode, can deliver multi-Gbps throughput reliably if the installation is\ndense enough, but performance is still brittle due to the propagation\nlimitations imposed by distance and body loss.

      "abstract": "Point clouds obtained from 3D sensors are usually sparse. Existing methods\nmainly focus on upsampling sparse point clouds in a supervised manner by using\ndense ground truth point clouds. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised\npoint cloud upsampling network (SSPU-Net) to generate dense point clouds\nwithout using ground truth. To achieve this, we exploit the consistency between\nthe input sparse point cloud and generated dense point cloud for the shapes and\nrendered images. Specifically, we first propose a neighbor expansion unit (NEU)\nto upsample the sparse point clouds, where the local geometric structures of\nthe sparse point clouds are exploited to learn weights for point interpolation.\nThen, we develop a differentiable point cloud rendering unit (DRU) as an\nend-to-end module in our network to render the point cloud into multi-view\nimages. Finally, we formulate a shape-consistent loss and an image-consistent\nloss to train the network so that the shapes of the sparse and dense point\nclouds are as consistent as possible. Extensive results on the CAD and scanned\ndatasets demonstrate that our method can achieve impressive results in a\nself-supervised manner.

      "abstract": "Deep learning is a potential approach to automatically develop kinetic models\nfrom experimental data. We propose a deep neural network model of KiNet to\nrepresent chemical kinetics. KiNet takes the current composition states and\npredicts the evolution of the states after a fixed time step. The long-period\nevolution of the states and their gradients to model parameters can be\nefficiently obtained by recursively applying the KiNet model multiple times. To\naddress the challenges of the high-dimensional composition space and error\naccumulation in long-period prediction, the architecture of KiNet incorporates\nthe residual network model (ResNet), and the training employs backpropagation\nthrough time (BPTT) approach to minimize multi-step prediction error. In\naddition, an approach for efficiently computing the gradient of the ignition\ndelay time (IDT) to KiNet model parameters is proposed to train the KiNet\nagainst the rich database of IDT from literature, which could address the\nscarcity of time-resolved species measurements. The KiNet is first trained and\ncompared with the simulated species profiles during the auto-ignition of H2/air\nmixtures. The obtained KiNet model can accurately predict the auto-ignition\nprocesses for various initial conditions that cover a wide range of pressures,\ntemperatures, and equivalence ratios. Then, we show that the gradient of IDT to\nKiNet model parameters is parallel to the gradient of the temperature at the\nignition point. This correlation enables efficient computation of the gradient\nof IDT via backpropagation and is demonstrated as a feasible approach for\nfine-tuning the KiNet against IDT. These demonstrations shall open up the\npossibility of building data-driven kinetic models autonomously. Finally, the\ntrained KiNet could be potentially applied to kinetic model reduction and\nchemistry acceleration in turbulent combustion simulations.",

      "abstract": "Zonal jets are common in planetary atmospheres. Their character, structure,\nand seasonal variability depend on the planetary parameters. During solstice on\nEarth and Mars, there is a strong westerly jet in the winter hemisphere and\nweak, low-level westerlies in the ascending regions of the Hadley cell in the\nsummer hemisphere. This summer jet has been less explored in a broad planetary\ncontext, both due to the dominance of the winter jet and since the balances\ncontrolling it are more complex, and understanding them requires exploring a\nbroader parameter regime. To better understand the jet characteristics on\nterrestrial planets and the transition between winter- and summer-dominated jet\nregimes, we explore the jet's dependence on rotation rate and obliquity. Across\na significant portion of the parameter space, the dominant jet is in the winter\nhemisphere, and the summer jet is weaker and restricted to the boundary layer.\nHowever, we show that for slow rotation rates and high obliquities, the\nstrongest jet is in the summer rather than the winter hemisphere. Analysis of\nthe summer jet's momentum balance reveals that the balance is not simply\ncyclostrophic and that both boundary layer drag and vertical advection are\nessential. At high obliquities and slow rotation rates, the cross-equatorial\nwinter cell is wide and strong. The returning poleward flow in the summer\nhemisphere is balanced by low-level westerlies through an Ekman balance and\nmomentum is advected upwards close to the ascending branch, resulting in a\nmid-troposphere summer jet.",

      "abstract": "Existing anomaly detection paradigms overwhelmingly focus on training\ndetection models using exclusively normal data or unlabeled data (mostly normal\nsamples). One notorious issue with these approaches is that they are weak in\ndiscriminating anomalies from normal samples due to the lack of the knowledge\nabout the anomalies. Here, we study the problem of few-shot anomaly detection,\nin which we aim at using a few labeled anomaly examples to train\nsample-efficient discriminative detection models. To address this problem, we\nintroduce a novel weakly-supervised anomaly detection framework to train\ndetection models without assuming the examples illustrating all possible\nclasses of anomaly.\n  Specifically, the proposed approach learns discriminative normality\n(regularity) by leveraging the labeled anomalies and a prior probability to\nenforce expressive representations of normality and unbounded deviated\nrepresentations of abnormality. This is achieved by an end-to-end optimization\nof anomaly scores with a neural deviation learning, in which the anomaly scores\nof normal samples are imposed to approximate scalar scores drawn from the prior\nwhile that of anomaly examples is enforced to have statistically significant\ndeviations from these sampled scores in the upper tail. Furthermore, our model\nis optimized to learn fine-grained normality and abnormality by top-K\nmultiple-instance-learning-based feature subspace deviation learning, allowing\nmore generalized representations. Comprehensive experiments on nine real-world\nimage anomaly detection benchmarks show that our model is substantially more\nsample-efficient and robust, and performs significantly better than\nstate-of-the-art competing methods in both closed-set and open-set settings.\nOur model can also offer explanation capability as a result of its prior-driven\nanomaly score learning.

To address this,\nwe propose a two-layer hierarchical machine learning model having an accuracy\nof 95.44 % to improve the detection of cyberattacks.

The\nsynthesis conditions, under which cobalt predominantly (up to 76%) substitutes\nthe atoms at the $A$ site of the perovskite structure, is found for\nSrTiO$_3$(Co) samples. By varying the synthesis conditions, it is possible to\nappreciably change the ratio between the concentrations of cobalt atoms\nincorporated into the $A$ and $B$ sites.

Webots, a state-of-the-art\nrobotics simulator, is often the software of choice for robotics research. Even\nso, Webots simulations are often run on personal and lab computers. For\nprojects that would benefit from an aggregated output dataset from thousands of\nsimulation runs, there is no standard recourse; this project sets out to\nmitigate this by developing a formalized parallel pipeline for running\nsequences of Webots simulations on powerful HPC resources. Such a pipeline\nwould allow researchers to generate massive datasets from their simulations,\nopening the door for potential machine learning applications and decision tool\ndevelopment. We have developed a pipeline capable of running Webots simulations\nboth headlessly and in GUI-enabled mode over an SSH X11 server, with simulation\nexecution occurring remotely on HPC compute nodes. Additionally, simulations\ncan be run in sequence, with a batch job being distributed across an arbitrary\nnumber of computing nodes and each node having multiple instances running in\nparallel. The implemented distribution and parallelization are extremely\neffective, with a 100\\% simulation completion rate after 12 hours of runs.\nOverall, this pipeline is very capable and can be used to extend existing\nprojects or serve as a platform for new robotics simulation endeavors.",

However, the cost of MC sampling\nneeded in RS for evaluation is high and computationally expensive. To address\nthis issue, we investigate the possibility of performing randomized smoothing\nand establishing the robust certification in the latent space of a network, so\nthat the overall dimensionality of tensors involved in computation could be\ndrastically reduced. To this end, we propose Latent Space Randomized Smoothing.\nAnother important aspect is that we use orthogonal modules, whose Lipschitz\nproperty is known for free by design, to propagate the certified radius\nestimated in the latent space back to the input space, providing valid\ncertifiable regions for the test samples in the input space. Experiments on\nCIFAR10 and ImageNet show that our method achieves competitive certified\nrobustness but with a significant improvement of efficiency during the test\nphase.",

      "abstract": "This paper is concerned with detecting an integer parameter vector inside a\nbox from a linear model that is corrupted with a noise vector following the\nGaussian distribution. One of the commonly used detectors is the maximum\nlikelihood detector, which is obtained by solving a box-constrained integer\nleast squares problem, that is NP-hard. Two other popular detectors are the\nbox-constrained rounding and Babai detectors due to their high efficiency of\nimplementation. In this paper, we first present formulas for the success\nprobabilities (the probabilities of correct detection) of these three detectors\nfor two different situations: the integer parameter vector is deterministic and\nis uniformly distributed over the constraint box. Then, we give two simple\nexamples to respectively show that the success probability of the\nbox-constrained rounding detector can be larger than that of the\nbox-constrained Babai detector and the latter can be larger than the success\nprobability of the maximum likelihood detector when the parameter vector is\ndeterministic, and prove that the success probability of the box-constrained\nrounding detector is always not larger than that of the box-constrained Babai\ndetector when the parameter vector is uniformly distributed over the constraint\nbox. Some relations between the results for the box constrained and ordinary\ncases are presented, and two bounds on the success probability of the maximum\nlikelihood detector, which can easily be computed, are developed. Finally,\nsimulation results are provided to illustrate our main theoretical findings.",

Given the adverse\nimpacts of air pollution, many responses have been taken, including migration\nto another city. The current study explores the psychological process and\ndemographic predictors of migration intention among urban people in Hanoi,\nVietnam - one of the most polluted capital cities in the world. The Bayesian\nMindsponge Framework (BMF) was used to construct the model and perform Bayesian\nanalysis on a stratified random sampling dataset of 475 urban people. We found\nthat the migration intention was negatively associated with the individual's\nsatisfaction with air quality. The association was moderated by the perceived\navailability of a better alternative (or nearby city with better air quality).\nHowever, the high migration cost due to geographical distance made the\nmoderation effect of the perceived availability of a better alternative\nnegligible. Moreover, it was also found that male and young people were more\nlikely to migrate, but the brain drain hypothesis was not validated. The\nresults hint that without air pollution mitigation measures, the dislocation of\neconomic forces might occur and hinder sustainable urban development.\nTherefore, collaborative actions among levels of government, with the\nsemi-conducting principle at heart, are recommended to reduce air pollution.",

      "abstract": "Tracking the 6D pose of objects in video sequences is important for robot\nmanipulation. Most prior efforts, however, often assume that the target\nobject's CAD model, at least at a category-level, is available for offline\ntraining or during online template matching. This work proposes BundleTrack, a\ngeneral framework for 6D pose tracking of novel objects, which does not depend\nupon 3D models, either at the instance or category-level. It leverages the\ncomplementary attributes of recent advances in deep learning for segmentation\nand robust feature extraction, as well as memory-augmented pose graph\noptimization for spatiotemporal consistency. This enables long-term, low-drift\ntracking under various challenging scenarios, including significant occlusions\nand object motions. Comprehensive experiments given two public benchmarks\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-art,\ncategory-level 6D tracking or dynamic SLAM methods. When compared against\nstate-of-art methods that rely on an object instance CAD model, comparable\nperformance is achieved, despite the proposed method's reduced information\nrequirements. An efficient implementation in CUDA provides a real-time\nperformance of 10Hz for the entire framework. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/wenbowen123/BundleTrack",

This\nmicro-level question has global implications: countries that systematically\n\"oversave\" export capital by running current account surpluses. In the\nrecipient countries, interest rates are thus too low and financial stability is\nput at risk. Existing theories argue that saving is precautionary, but tests\nare limited to cross-country comparisons and are not always supportive. We\nreport the findings of an original survey experiment. Using a simulated\nfinancial saving task implemented online, we compare the saving preferences of\na large and diverse sample of Chinese-Canadians with other Canadians. This\ncomparison is instructive given that Chinese-Canadians migrated from, or\ndescend from those who migrated from, a high-saving environment to a\nlow-savings, high-debt environment. We also compare behavior in the presence\nand absence of a simulated \"welfare state,\" which we represent in the form of\nmandatory insurance. Our respondents exhibit behavior in the saving task that\ncorresponds to standard economic assumptions about lifecycle savings and risk\naversion. We find strong evidence that precautionary saving is reduced when a\nmandatory insurance is present, but no sign that Chinese cultural influences -\nrepresented in linguistic or ethnic terms - have any effect on saving behavior.",

Systematic research on the effects of\ngravity is crucial for advancing our knowledge and for the success of space\nmissions. Due to the high cost and the limitations in the payload size and mass\nin typical spaceflight missions, ground-based low-gravity simulators have\nbecome indispensable for preparing spaceflight experiments and for serving as\nstand-alone research platforms. Among various simulator systems, the magnetic\nlevitation based simulator (MLS) has received long-lasting interests due to its\neasily adjustable gravity and practically unlimited operation time. However, a\nrecognized issue with MLSs is their highly non-uniform force field. For a\nsolenoid MLS, the functional volume $V_{1\\%}$, where the net force results in\nan acceleration less than 1\\% of the Earth's gravity $g$, is typically a few\nmicroliters ($\\mu L$) or less. In this work, we report an innovative MLS design\nthat integrates a superconducting magnet with a gradient-field Maxwell coil.\nThrough an optimization analysis, we show that an unprecedented $V_{1\\%}$ of\nover 4,000 $\\mu L$ can be achieved in a compact coil with a diameter of 8 cm.\nWe also discuss how such an MLS can be made using existing high-$T_c$\nsuperconducting materials. When the current in this MLS is reduced to emulate\nthe gravity on Mars ($g_M=0.38g$), a functional volume where the gravity varies\nwithin a few percent of $g_M$ can exceed 20,000 $\\mu L$.

Researchers have worked hard\ntrying to automate many components of the pipeline. However, one key component\nof the pipeline--problem definition--is still left mostly unexplored in terms\nof automation. Usually, it requires extensive efforts from domain experts to\nidentify, define and formulate important problems in an area. However,\nautomatically discovering research or application problems for an area is\nbeneficial since it helps to identify valid and potentially important problems\nhidden in data that are unknown to domain experts, expand the scope of tasks\nthat we can do in an area, and even inspire completely new findings.\n  This paper describes Problem Learning, which aims at learning to discover and\ndefine valid and ethical problems from data or from the machine's interaction\nwith the environment. We formalize problem learning as the identification of\nvalid and ethical problems in a problem space and introduce several possible\napproaches to problem learning. In a broader sense, problem learning is an\napproach towards the free will of intelligent machines. Currently, machines are\nstill limited to solving the problems defined by humans, without the ability or\nflexibility to freely explore various possible problems that are even unknown\nto humans. Though many machine learning techniques have been developed and\nintegrated into intelligent systems, they still focus on the means rather than\nthe purpose in that machines are still solving human defined problems. However,\nproposing good problems is sometimes even more important than solving problems,\nbecause a good problem can help to inspire new ideas and gain deeper\nunderstandings.

However, these models are facing challenges\nof overfitting with limited labels and low model generalization abilities. In\nthis paper, we present a Cross-modal Transformer for Audio-and-Language, i.e.,\nCTAL, which aims to learn the intra-modality and inter-modality connections\nbetween audio and language through two proxy tasks on a large amount of\naudio-and-language pairs: masked language modeling and masked cross-modal\nacoustic modeling. After fine-tuning our pre-trained model on multiple\ndownstream audio-and-language tasks, we observe significant improvements across\nvarious tasks, such as, emotion classification, sentiment analysis, and speaker\nverification. On this basis, we further propose a specially-designed fusion\nmechanism that can be used in fine-tuning phase, which allows our pre-trained\nmodel to achieve better performance. Lastly, we demonstrate detailed ablation\nstudies to prove that both our novel cross-modality fusion component and\naudio-language pre-training methods significantly contribute to the promising\nresults.",

Our algorithm solves\nthe PDG problem by framing it as an $\\mathcal{L}^1$ SOC problem for minimum\nfuel consumption. Additionally, it can handle practically useful control\nconstraints, nonlinear dynamics and enforces state constraints as\nsoft-constraints. This is achieved by building off of recent work on deep\nForward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs) and differentiable\nnon-convex optimization neural-network layers based on stochastic search. In\ncontrast to previous approaches, our algorithm does not require convexification\nof the constraints or linearization of the dynamics and is empirically shown to\nbe robust to stochastic disturbances and the initial position of the\nspacecraft. After training offline, our controller can be activated once the\nspacecraft is within a pre-specified radius of the landing zone and at a\npre-specified altitude i.e., the base of an inverted cone with the tip at the\nlanding zone. We demonstrate empirically that our controller can successfully\nand safely land all trajectories initialized at the base of this cone while\nminimizing fuel consumption.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models can be trade secrets due to their development\ncost. Hence, they need protection against malicious forms of reverse\nengineering (e.g., in IP piracy). With a growing shift of ML to the edge\ndevices, in part for performance and in part for privacy benefits, the models\nhave become susceptible to the so-called physical side-channel attacks.\n  ML being a relatively new target compared to cryptography poses the problem\nof side-channel analysis in a context that lacks published literature. The gap\nbetween the burgeoning edge-based ML devices and the research on adequate\ndefenses to provide side-channel security for them thus motivates our study.\nOur work develops and combines different flavors of side-channel defenses for\nML models in the hardware blocks. We propose and optimize the first defense\nbased on Boolean masking. We first implement all the masked hardware blocks. We\nthen present an adder optimization to reduce the area and latency overheads.\nFinally, we couple it with a shuffle-based defense.\n  We quantify that the area-delay overhead of masking ranges from 5.4$\\times$\nto 4.7$\\times$ depending on the adder topology used and demonstrate first-order\nside-channel security of millions of power traces.

In this paper, we present a novel technique to\nextract such patterns from time series generated from simulations of seismic\nresponses. The core of our approach is the use of topic modeling, where topics\ncorrespond to interpretable and discriminative features of the earthquakes. We\ntransform the raw time series data into a time series of topics, and use this\nvisual summary to compare temporal patterns in earthquakes, query earthquakes\nvia the topics across arbitrary time scales, and enable details on demand by\nlinking the topic visualization with the original earthquake data. We show,\nthrough a surrogate task and an expert study, that this technique allows\nanalysts to more easily identify recurring patterns in such time series.

In this paper, a template matching framework is proposed to\nre-localize a robot globally in a 3D LiDAR map. This presents two main\nchallenges. First, most global descriptors for point cloud can only be used for\nplace detection under a small local area. Therefore, in order to re-localize\nglobally in the map, point clouds and descriptors(templates) are densely\ncollected using a reconstructed mesh model at an offline stage by a physical\nsimulation engine to expand the functional distance of point cloud descriptors.\nSecond, the increased number of collected templates makes the matching stage\ntoo slow to meet the real-time requirement, for which a cascade matching method\nis presented for better efficiency. In the experiments, the proposed framework\nachieves 0.2-meter accuracy at about 10Hz matching speed using pure python\nimplementation with 100k templates, which is effective and efficient for SLAM\napplications.",

      "title": "An Empirical Study on the Joint Impact of Feature Selection and Data\n  Re-sampling on Imbalance Classification",
      "abstract": "In predictive tasks, real-world datasets often present different degrees of\nimbalanced (i.e., long-tailed or skewed) distributions. While the majority (the\nhead) classes have sufficient samples, the minority (the tail) classes can be\nunder-represented by a rather limited number of samples. Data pre-processing\nhas been shown to be very effective in dealing with such problems. On one hand,\ndata re-sampling is a common approach to tackling class imbalance. On the other\nhand, dimension reduction, which reduces the feature space, is a conventional\ntechnique for reducing noise and inconsistencies in a dataset. However, the\npossible synergy between feature selection and data re-sampling for\nhigh-performance imbalance classification has rarely been investigated before.\nTo address this issue, we carry out a comprehensive empirical study on the\njoint influence of feature selection and re-sampling on two-class imbalance\nclassification. Specifically, we study the performance of two opposite\npipelines for imbalance classification by applying feature selection before or\nafter data re-sampling. We conduct a large number of experiments, with a total\nof 9225 tests, on 52 publicly available datasets, using 9 feature selection\nmethods, 6 re-sampling approaches for class imbalance learning, and 3\nwell-known classification algorithms. Experimental results show that there is\nno constant winner between the two pipelines; thus both of them should be\nconsidered to derive the best performing model for imbalance classification. We\nfind that the performance of an imbalance classification model not only depends\non the classifier adopted and the ratio between the number of majority and\nminority samples, but also depends on the ratio between the number of samples\nand features. Overall, this study should provide new reference value for\nresearchers and practitioners in imbalance learning.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we focus on resource allocation in a decentralised open market.\nIn decentralised open markets consists of multiple vendors and multiple\ndynamically-arriving buyers, thus makes the market complex and dynamic.\nBecause, in these markets, negotiations among vendors and buyers take place\nover multiple conflicting issues such as price, scalability, robustness, delay,\netc. As a result, optimising the resource allocation in such open markets\nbecomes directly dependent on two key decisions, which are; incorporating a\ndifferent kind of buyers' preferences, and fairness based vendor elicitation\nstrategy. Towards this end, in this work, we propose a three-step resource\nallocation approach that employs a reverse-auction paradigm. At the first step,\npriority label is attached to each bidding vendor based on the proposed\npriority mechanism. Then, at the second step, the preference score is\ncalculated for all the different kinds of preferences of the buyers. Finally,\nat the third step, based on the priority label of the vendor and the preference\nscore winner is determined. Finally, we compare the proposed approach with two\nstate-of-the-art resource pricing and allocation strategies. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed approach outperforms the other two resource\nallocation approaches in terms of the independent utilities of buyers and the\noverall utility of the open market.",

      "abstract": "Person search aims to simultaneously localize and identify a query person\nfrom realistic, uncropped images. To achieve this goal, state-of-the-art models\ntypically add a re-id branch upon two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN. Owing\nto the ROI-Align operation, this pipeline yields promising accuracy as re-id\nfeatures are explicitly aligned with the corresponding object regions, but in\nthe meantime, it introduces high computational overhead due to dense object\nanchors. In this work, we present an anchor-free approach to efficiently\ntackling this challenging task, by introducing the following dedicated designs.\nFirst, we select an anchor-free detector (i.e., FCOS) as the prototype of our\nframework. Due to the lack of dense object anchors, it exhibits significantly\nhigher efficiency compared with existing person search models. Second, when\ndirectly accommodating this anchor-free detector for person search, there exist\nseveral major challenges in learning robust re-id features, which we summarize\nas the misalignment issues in different levels (i.e., scale, region, and task).\nTo address these issues, we propose an aligned feature aggregation module to\ngenerate more discriminative and robust feature embeddings. Accordingly, we\nname our model as Feature-Aligned Person Search Network (AlignPS). Third, by\ninvestigating the advantages of both anchor-based and anchor-free models, we\nfurther augment AlignPS with an ROI-Align head, which significantly improves\nthe robustness of re-id features while still keeping our model highly\nefficient. Extensive experiments conducted on two challenging benchmarks (i.e.,\nCUHK-SYSU and PRW) demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art or\ncompetitive performance, while displaying higher efficiency.

      "abstract": "Metal vapour vacuum arcs are capable to generate multiply charged metallic\nions, which are widely used in fields such as ion deposition, ion thrusters,\nand ion sources, etc. According to the stationary model of cathode spot, those\nions are generated by electron-impact single ionization in a step-wise manner,\nwhich is M -> M+ -> M2+ -> ... mainly. This paper is designed to study\nquantitatively the role of double ionization M -> M2+ in the breakdown\ninitiation of copper vacuum arcs. A direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) scheme\nof double ionization is proposed and incorporated into a 2D particle-in-cell\n(PIC) method. The super-particles of Cu2+ ions generated from different\nchannels are labelled independently in the PIC-DSMC modelling of vacuum arc\nbreakdown. The cathode erosion rate based on PIC modelling is about 40{\\mu}g/C\nin arc burning regime, which agrees well with previous experiments. The\ntemporal discharge behaviours such as arc current, arc voltage, and ionization\ndegree of arc plasma, are influenced with or without double ionization\nnegligibly. However, additional Cu2+ ions are generated near the cathode in\nbreakdown initiation from the double ionization channel, with a lower kinetic\nenergy on average. Therefore, the results on spatial distribution and energy\nspectra of Cu2+ ions are different with or without double ionization. This\npaper provides a quantitative research method to evaluate the role of multiply\nionization in vacuum arcs.",

      "abstract": "The top-k recommendation is a fundamental task in recommendation systems\nwhich is generally learned by comparing positive and negative pairs. The\nContrastive Loss (CL) is the key in contrastive learning that has received more\nattention recently and we find it is well suited for top-k recommendations.\nHowever, it is a problem that CL treats the importance of the positive and\nnegative samples as the same. On the one hand, CL faces the imbalance problem\nof one positive sample and many negative samples. On the other hand, positive\nitems are so few in sparser datasets that their importance should be\nemphasized. Moreover, the other important issue is that the sparse positive\nitems are still not sufficiently utilized in recommendations. So we propose a\nnew data augmentation method by using multiple positive items (or samples)\nsimultaneously with the CL loss function. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Sample\nbased Contrastive Loss (MSCL) function which solves the two problems by\nbalancing the importance of positive and negative samples and data\naugmentation. And based on the graph convolution network (GCN) method,\nexperimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MSCL. The\nproposed MSCL is simple and can be applied in many methods.

      "abstract": "Using the DIANOGA hydrodynamical zoom-in simulation set of galaxy clusters,\nwe analyze the dynamics traced by stars belonging to the Brightest Cluster\nGalaxies (BCGs) and their surrounding diffuse component, forming the\nintracluster light (ICL), and compare it to the dynamics traced by dark matter\nand galaxies identified in the simulations. We compute scaling relations\nbetween the BCG and cluster velocity dispersions and their corresponding masses\n(i.e. $M_\\mathrm{BCG}^{\\star}$- $\\sigma_\\mathrm{BCG}^{\\star}$, $M_{200}$-\n$\\sigma_{200}$, $M_\\mathrm{BCG}^{\\star}$- $M_{200}$,\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{BCG}^{\\star}$- $\\sigma_{200}$), we find in general a good\nagreement with observational results. Our simulations also predict\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{BCG}^{\\star}$- $\\sigma_{200}$ relation to not change\nsignificantly up to redshift $z=1$, in line with a relatively slow accretion of\nthe BCG stellar mass at late times. We analyze the main features of the\nvelocity dispersion profiles, as traced by stars, dark matter, and galaxies. As\na result, we discuss that observed stellar velocity dispersion profiles in the\ninner cluster regions are in excellent agreement with simulations. We also\nreport that the slopes of the BCG velocity dispersion profile from simulations\nagree with what is measured in observations, confirming the existence of a\nrobust correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion slope and the\ncluster velocity dispersion (thus, cluster mass) when the former is computed\nwithin $0.1 R_{500}$. Our results demonstrate that simulations can correctly\ndescribe the dynamics of BCGs and their surrounding stellar envelope, as\ndetermined by the past star-formation and assembly histories of the most\nmassive galaxies of the Universe.",

The proposed method applies a block-wise transformation with a secret\nkey to feature maps in the network. Conventional key-based model protection\nmethods cannot maintain a high accuracy when a large key space is selected. In\ncontrast, the proposed method not only maintains almost the same accuracy as\nnon-protected accuracy, but also has a larger key space.

      "abstract": "The increased proliferation of abusive content on social media platforms has\na negative impact on online users. The dread, dislike, discomfort, or mistrust\nof lesbian, gay, transgender or bisexual persons is defined as\nhomophobia/transphobia. Homophobic/transphobic speech is a type of offensive\nlanguage that may be summarized as hate speech directed toward LGBT+ people,\nand it has been a growing concern in recent years. Online\nhomophobia/transphobia is a severe societal problem that can make online\nplatforms poisonous and unwelcome to LGBT+ people while also attempting to\neliminate equality, diversity, and inclusion. We provide a new hierarchical\ntaxonomy for online homophobia and transphobia, as well as an expert-labelled\ndataset that will allow homophobic/transphobic content to be automatically\nidentified. We educated annotators and supplied them with comprehensive\nannotation rules because this is a sensitive issue, and we previously\ndiscovered that untrained crowdsourcing annotators struggle with diagnosing\nhomophobia due to cultural and other prejudices. The dataset comprises 15,141\nannotated multilingual comments. This paper describes the process of building\nthe dataset, qualitative analysis of data, and inter-annotator agreement. In\naddition, we create baseline models for the dataset. To the best of our\nknowledge, our dataset is the first such dataset created.

They can be\nused to complement the existing public cellular networks to provide temporary\nand on-demand connectivity in emergency situations. However, operating\ndeployable networks in coexistence with public cellular networks can be\nchallenging from an interference perspective. To gain insights on the\ndeployment strategy for deployable networks, in this article, we present an\nextensive numerical study of coverage and interference analysis, considering\nfour different co-existence scenarios and different types of deployable base\nstations (BSs), i.e., BS on a truck and BS on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).\nOur simulation results show that deploying deployable BSs in rural scenarios\ncan provide good coverage to meet the service requirement for mission critical\n(MC) users. In addition, the interference impact is only substantial when the\ndeployable and public networks are close to each other. Finally, allowing the\nMC users to access the public network can be of vital importance to guarantee\ntheir service when the interference level between public and deployable network\nis very high.",

      "abstract": "Natural and synthetic phenazines are widely used in biomedical sciences. In\ndehydrogenase histochemistry, phenazine methosulfate (PMS) is applied as a\nredox reagent for coupling reduced coenzymes to the reduction of tetrazolium\nsalts into colored formazans. PMS is also currently used for cytotoxicity and\nviability assays of cell cultures using sulfonated tetrazoliums. Under UV (340\nnm) excitation, aqueous solutions of the cationic PMS show green fluorescence\n({\\lambda}em: 526 nm), whereas the reduced hydrophobic derivative\n(methyl-phenazine, MPH) shows blue fluorescence ({\\lambda}em: 465 nm). Under UV\n(365 nm) excitation, cultured cells (LM2, IGROV-1, BGC-1, and 3T3-L1\nadipocytes) treated with PMS (5 ug/mL, 30 min) showed cytoplasmic granules with\nbright blue fluorescence, which correspond to lipid droplets labeled by the\nlipophilic methyl-phenazine. After formaldehyde fixation blue-fluorescing\ndroplets could be stained with oil red O. Interestingly, PMS-treated 3T3-L1\nadipocytes observed under UV excitation 24 h after labeling showed large lipid\ndroplets with a weak green emission within a diffuse pale blue-fluorescing\ncytoplasm, whereas a strong green emission was observed in small lipid\ndroplets. This fluorescence change from blue to green indicates that\nreoxidation of methyl-phenazine to PMS can occur. Regarding cell uptake and\nlabeling mechanisms, QSAR models predict that the hydrophilic PMS is not\nsignificantly membrane-permeant, so most PMS reduction is expected to be\nextracellular and associated with a plasma membrane NAD(P)H reductase. Once\nformed, the lipophilic and blue-fluorescing methyl-phenazine enters live cells\nand mainly accumulates in lipid droplets. Overall, the results reported here\nindicate that PMS is an excellent fluorescent probe to investigate labeling and\nredox dynamics of lipid droplets in cultured cells.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms leading to the formation and the propagation of\ntraffic jams in large cities is of crucial importance for urban planning and\ntraffic management. Many studies have already considered the emergence of\ntraffic jams from the point of view of phase transitions, but mostly in simple\ngeometries such as highways for example, or in the framework of percolation\nwhere an external parameter is driving the transition. More generally,\nempirical evidence and characterization for a congestion transition in complex\nroad networks is scarce, and here we use traffic measures for Paris (France)\nduring the period 2014-2018 for testing the existence of a jamming transition\nat the urban level. In particular, we show that the correlation function of\ndelays due to congestion is a power law (with exponent $\\eta\\approx 0.4$)\ncombined with an exponential cut-off $\\xi$. This correlation length $\\xi$ is\nshown to diverge during rush hours, pointing to a jamming transition in urban\ntraffic. We also discuss the spatial structure of congestion and identify a\ncore of congested links that participate in most traffic jams and whose\nstructure is specific during rush hours. Finally, we show that the spatial\nstructure of congestion is consistent with a reaction-diffusion picture\nproposed previously.",

      "abstract": "When we place microphones close to a sound source near other sources in audio\nrecording, the obtained audio signal includes undesired sound from the other\nsources, which is often called cross-talk or bleeding sound. For many audio\napplications including onstage sound reinforcement and sound editing after a\nlive performance, it is important to reduce the bleeding sound in each recorded\nsignal. However, since microphones are spatially apart from each other in this\nsituation, typical phase-aware blind source separation (BSS) methods cannot be\nused. We propose a phase-insensitive method for blind bleeding-sound reduction.\nThis method is based on time-channel nonnegative matrix factorization, which is\na BSS method using only amplitude spectrograms. With the proposed method, we\nintroduce the gamma-distribution-based prior for leakage levels of bleeding\nsounds. Its optimization can be interpreted as maximum a posteriori estimation.\nThe experimental results of music bleeding-sound reduction indicate that the\nproposed method is more effective for bleeding-sound reduction of music signals\ncompared with other BSS methods.",

Following the standard queueing\ntheory, we show that by invoking a two-dimensional state vector which tracks\nthe AoI and packet age in system simultaneously, the stationary AoI\ndistribution can be derived by analyzing the steady state of the constituted\ntwo-dimensional stochastic process. We give the general formula of the AoI\ndistribution and calculate the explicit expression when the service time is\nalso geometrically distributed. The discrete and continuous AoI are compared,\nwe depict the mean of discrete AoI and that of continuous time AoI for system\nwith M/M/1/1 queue. Although the stationary AoI distribution of some continuous\ntime single-server system has been determined before, in this paper, we shall\nprove that the standard queueing theory is still appliable to analyze the\ndiscrete AoI, which is even stronger than the proposed methods handling the\ncontinuous AoI.",

This work analyzes the\nconnection between the two methods and shows that a Fourier mapped perceptron\nis structurally like one hidden layer SIREN. Furthermore, we identify the\nrelationship between the previously proposed Fourier mapping and the general\nd-dimensional Fourier series, leading to an integer lattice mapping. Moreover,\nwe modify a progressive training strategy to work on arbitrary Fourier mappings\nand show that it improves the generalization of the interpolation task. Lastly,\nwe compare the different mappings on the image regression and novel view\nsynthesis tasks. We confirm the previous finding that the main contributor to\nthe mapping performance is the size of the embedding and standard deviation of\nits elements.",

While the existing approaches to this task\nhave gained many progresses, they are limited at capturing relationships among\naspect-polarity pairs in a text, thus degrading the extraction performance.\nMoreover, the existing state-of-the-art approaches, namely token-based\nse-quence tagging and span-based classification, have their own defects such as\npolarity inconsistency resulted from separately tagging tokens in the former\nand the heterogeneous categorization in the latter where aspect-related and\npolarity-related labels are mixed. In order to remedy the above defects,\nin-spiring from the recent advancements in relation extraction, we propose to\ngenerate aspect-polarity pairs directly from a text with relation extraction\ntechnology, regarding aspect-pairs as unary relations where aspects are\nenti-ties and the corresponding polarities are relations. Based on the\nperspective, we present a position- and aspect-aware sequence2sequence model\nfor joint extraction of aspect-polarity pairs. The model is characterized with\nits ability to capture not only relationships among aspect-polarity pairs in a\ntext through the sequence decoding, but also correlations between an aspect and\nits polarity through the position- and aspect-aware attentions.

      "title": "Distributed training and scalability for the particle clustering method\n  UCluster",
      "abstract": "In recent years, machine-learning methods have become increasingly important\nfor the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). They are utilised in\neverything from trigger systems to reconstruction and data analysis. The recent\nUCluster method is a general model providing unsupervised clustering of\nparticle physics data, that can be easily modified to provide solutions for a\nvariety of different decision problems. In the current paper, we improve on the\nUCluster method by adding the option of training the model in a scalable and\ndistributed fashion, and thereby extending its utility to learn from\narbitrarily large data sets. UCluster combines a graph-based neural network\ncalled ABCnet with a clustering step, using a combined loss function in the\ntraining phase. The original code is publicly available in TensorFlow v1.14 and\nhas previously been trained on a single GPU. It shows a clustering accuracy of\n81% when applied to the problem of multi-class classification of simulated jet\nevents. Our implementation adds the distributed training functionality by\nutilising the Horovod distributed training framework, which necessitated a\nmigration of the code to TensorFlow v2. Together with using parquet files for\nsplitting data up between different compute nodes, the distributed training\nmakes the model scalable to any amount of input data, something that will be\nessential for use with real LHC data sets. We find that the model is well\nsuited for distributed training, with the training time decreasing in direct\nrelation to the number of GPU's used. However, further improvements by a more\nexhaustive and possibly distributed hyper-parameter search is required in order\nto achieve the reported accuracy of the original UCluster method.",

      "abstract": "The spatial covariance matrix has been considered to be significant for\nbeamformers. Standing upon the intersection of traditional beamformers and deep\nneural networks, we propose a causal neural beamformer paradigm called\nEmbedding and Beamforming, and two core modules are designed accordingly,\nnamely EM and BM. For EM, instead of estimating spatial covariance matrix\nexplicitly, the 3-D embedding tensor is learned with the network, where both\nspectral and spatial discriminative information can be represented. For BM, a\nnetwork is directly leveraged to derive the beamforming weights so as to\nimplement filter-and-sum operation. To further improve the speech quality, a\npost-processing module is introduced to further suppress the residual noise.\nBased on the DNS-Challenge dataset, we conduct the experiments for multichannel\nspeech enhancement and the results show that the proposed system outperforms\nprevious advanced baselines by a large margin in multiple evaluation metrics.",

      "abstract": "We present radio observations of the most slowly rotating known radio pulsar\nPSR J0250+5854. With a 23.5 s period, it is close, or even beyond, the\n$P$-$\\dot{P}$ diagram region thought to be occupied by active pulsars. The\nsimultaneous observations with FAST, the Chilbolton and Effelsberg LOFAR\ninternational stations, and NenuFAR represent a five-fold increase in the\nspectral coverage of this object, with the detections at 1250 MHz (FAST) and 57\nMHz (NenuFAR) being the highest- and lowest-frequency published respectively to\ndate. We measure a flux density of $4\\pm2$ $\\mu$Jy at 1250 MHz and an\nexceptionally steep spectral index of $-3.5^{+0.2}_{-1.5}$, with a turnover\nbelow $\\sim$95 MHz. In conjunction with observations of this pulsar with the\nGBT and the LOFAR Core, we show that the intrinsic profile width increases\ndrastically towards higher frequencies, contrary to the predictions of\nconventional radius-to-frequency mapping. We examine polarimetric data from\nFAST and the LOFAR Core and conclude that its polar cap radio emission is\nproduced at an absolute height of several hundreds of kilometres around 1.5\nGHz, similar to other rotation-powered pulsars across the population. Its beam\nis significantly underfilled at lower frequencies, or it narrows because of the\ndisappearance of conal outriders. Finally, the results for PSR J0250+5854 and\nother slowly spinning rotation-powered pulsars are contrasted with the\nradio-detected magnetars. We conclude that magnetars have intrinsically wider\nradio beams than the slow rotation-powered pulsars, and that consequently the\nlatter's lower beaming fraction is what makes objects such as PSR J0250+5854 so\nscarce.",

We also\nintroduce a new layerwise reinitialization algorithm that outperforms previous\nmethods and suggest explanations of the observed improved generalization.\nFirst, we show that layerwise reinitialization increases the margin on the\ntraining examples without increasing the norm of the weights, hence leading to\nan improvement in margin-based generalization bounds for neural networks.\nSecond, we demonstrate that it settles in flatter local minima of the loss\nsurface. Third, it encourages learning general rules and discourages\nmemorization by placing emphasis on the lower layers of the neural network.

      "abstract": "Multilingual pre-trained models have demonstrated their effectiveness in many\nmultilingual NLP tasks and enabled zero-shot or few-shot transfer from\nhigh-resource languages to low resource ones. However, due to significant\ntypological differences and contradictions between some languages, such models\nusually perform poorly on many languages and cross-lingual settings, which\nshows the difficulty of learning a single model to handle massive diverse\nlanguages well at the same time. To alleviate this issue, we present a new\nmultilingual pre-training pipeline. We propose to generate language\nrepresentation from multilingual pre-trained models and conduct linguistic\nanalysis to show that language representation similarity reflect linguistic\nsimilarity from multiple perspectives, including language family, geographical\nsprachbund, lexicostatistics and syntax. Then we cluster all the target\nlanguages into multiple groups and name each group as a representation\nsprachbund. Thus, languages in the same representation sprachbund are supposed\nto boost each other in both pre-training and fine-tuning as they share rich\nlinguistic similarity. We pre-train one multilingual model for each\nrepresentation sprachbund. Experiments are conducted on cross-lingual\nbenchmarks and significant improvements are achieved compared to strong\nbaselines.",

With this now meeting user expectations for a range of diverse\napplications, speech technology is today omni-present. As result, a focus on\nsecurity and privacy has now come to the fore. Here, the research effort is in\nits relative infancy and progress calls for greater, multidisciplinary\ncollaboration with security, privacy, legal and ethical experts among others.\nSuch collaboration is now underway. To help catalyse the efforts, this paper\nprovides a high-level overview of some related research. It targets the\nnon-speech audience and describes the benchmarking methodology that has\nspearheaded progress in traditional research and which now drives recent\nsecurity and privacy initiatives related to voice biometrics. We describe: the\nASVspoof challenge relating to the development of spoofing countermeasures; the\nVoicePrivacy initiative which promotes research in anonymisation for privacy\npreservation.",

      "title": "Complex Event Forecasting with Prediction Suffix Trees: Extended\n  Technical Report",
      "abstract": "Complex Event Recognition (CER) systems have become popular in the past two\ndecades due to their ability to \"instantly\" detect patterns on real-time\nstreams of events. However, there is a lack of methods for forecasting when a\npattern might occur before such an occurrence is actually detected by a CER\nengine. We present a formal framework that attempts to address the issue of\nComplex Event Forecasting (CEF). Our framework combines two formalisms: a)\nsymbolic automata which are used to encode complex event patterns; and b)\nprediction suffix trees which can provide a succinct probabilistic description\nof an automaton's behavior. We compare our proposed approach against\nstate-of-the-art methods and show its advantage in terms of accuracy and\nefficiency. In particular, prediction suffix trees, being variable-order Markov\nmodels, have the ability to capture long-term dependencies in a stream by\nremembering only those past sequences that are informative enough. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate the benefits, in terms of accuracy, of being\nable to capture such long-term dependencies. This is achieved by increasing the\norder of our model beyond what is possible with full-order Markov models that\nneed to perform an exhaustive enumeration of all possible past sequences of a\ngiven order. We also discuss extensively how CEF solutions should be best\nevaluated on the quality of their forecasts.",

      "abstract": "The adiabatic quantum-flux parametron (AQFP) is a promising energy-efficient\nsuperconducting technology. Before technology mapping, additional buffer and\nsplitter cells need to be inserted into AQFP circuits to fulfill two special\nconstraints: (1) Input signals to a logic gate need to arrive at the same time,\nthus shorter paths need to be delayed with buffers. (2) The output signal of a\nlogic gate has to be actively branched with splitters if it drives multiple\nfanouts. Buffers and splitters largely increase the area and delay in AQFP\ncircuits. Na\\\"ive buffer and splitter insertion and light-weight optimization\nusing retiming techniques have been used in related works, and it is not clear\nhow much space there is for further optimization. In this paper, we develop (a)\na linear-time algorithm to insert buffers and splitters irredundantly, and (b)\noptimization methods by scheduling and by moving groups of gates, called\nchunks, together. Experimental results show a reduction of up to 39% on buffer\nand splitter cost. Moreover, as the technology is still developing and\nassumptions on the physical constraints are not clear yet, we also discuss the\nimpacts of different assumptions with experimental results to motivate future\nresearch on AQFP register design.",

      "abstract": "Mobile wireless sensors are increasingly recognized as a valuable tool for\nmonitoring critical infrastructures. An important use case is the discovery of\nleaks and inflows in pipe networks using a swarm of floating sensor nodes.\nWhile passively drifting along, the devices must track their individual\npositions so critical points can later be located. Since pipelines are often\nsituated in inaccessible places, large portions of the network can be shielded\nfrom radio and satellite signals, rendering conventional positioning systems\nineffective.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for assigning location estimates\nto recorded measurements once the sensor node leaves the inaccessible area and\ntransmits them via a gateway. The solution is range-free and makes use of a\npriori information about the target pipeline network. We further describe two\nextended variants of our algorithm which use data of encounters with other\nsensor nodes to improve accuracy. Finally, we evaluate all variants with\nrespect to various network topologies and different numbers of mobile nodes in\na simulation. The results show that our algorithm localizes measurements with\nan average accuracy between 4.81% and 7.58%, depending on the variability of\nflow speed and the sparsity of reference points.",

      "abstract": "One of the new scientific ways of understanding discourse dynamics is\nanalyzing the public data of social networks. This research's aim is\nPost-structuralist Discourse Analysis (PDA) of Covid-19 phenomenon (inspired by\nLaclau and Mouffe's Discourse Theory) by using Intelligent Data Mining for\nPersian Society. The examined big data is five million tweets from 160,000\nusers of the Persian Twitter network to compare two discourses. Besides\nanalyzing the tweet texts individually, a social network graph database has\nbeen created based on retweets relationships. We use the VoteRank algorithm to\nintroduce and rank people whose posts become word of mouth, provided that the\ntotal information spreading scope is maximized over the network. These users\nare also clustered according to their word usage pattern (the Gaussian Mixture\nModel is used). The constructed discourse of influential spreaders is compared\nto the most active users. This analysis is done based on Covid-related posts\nover eight episodes. Also, by relying on the statistical content analysis and\npolarity of tweet words, discourse analysis is done for the whole mentioned\nsubpopulations, especially for the top individuals. The most important result\nof this research is that the Twitter subjects' discourse construction is\ngovernment-based rather than community-based. The analyzed Iranian society does\nnot consider itself responsible for the Covid-19 wicked problem, does not\nbelieve in participation, and expects the government to solve all problems. The\nmost active and most influential users' similarity is that political, national,\nand critical discourse construction is the predominant one. In addition to the\nadvantages of its research methodology, it is necessary to pay attention to the\nstudy's limitations. Suggestion for future encounters of Iranian society with\nsimilar crises is given.",

      "abstract": "XML configuration files are widely used in Android to define an app's user\ninterface and essential runtime information such as system permissions. As\nAndroid evolves, it might introduce functional changes in the configuration\nenvironment, thus causing compatibility issues that manifest as inconsistent\napp behaviors at different API levels. Such issues can often induce software\ncrashes and inconsistent look-and-feel when running at specific Android\nversions. Existing works incur plenty of false positive and false negative\nissue-detection rules by conducting trivial data-flow analysis while failing to\nmodel the XML tree hierarchies of the Android configuration files. Besides,\nlittle is known about how the changes in an Android framework can induce such\ncompatibility issues. To bridge such gaps, we conducted a systematic study by\nanalyzing 196 real-world issues collected from 43 popular apps. We identified\ncommon patterns of Android framework code changes that induce such\nconfiguration compatibility issues. Based on the findings, we propose\n\\textsc{ConfDroid} that can automatically extract rules for detecting\nconfiguration compatibility issues. The intuition is to perform symbolic\nexecution based on a model learned from the common code change patterns.\nExperiment results show that ConfDroid can successfully extract 282 valid\nissue-detection rules with a precision of 91.9%. Among them, 65 extracted rules\ncan manifest issues that cannot be detected by the rules of state-of-the-art\nbaselines. More importantly, 11 out of them have led to the detection of 107\nreproducible configuration compatibility issues that the baselines cannot\ndetect in 30 out of 316 real-world Android apps.",

Based on this unique\nlight-bending phenomenon, a novel near-field photonic switch by means of a\nright-trapezoid dielectric Janus particle-lens embedded in the core of a planar\nwaveguide is proposed for switching the photonic signals at two common optical\ncommunication wavelengths 1310 nm and 1550 nm by using numerical simulations.\nThe signals at these two wavelengths can be guided to different routes\naccording to their oppositely bent photonic hooks to realise wavelength\nselective switching. The switching mechanism is analysed by an in-house\ndeveloped three-dimensional (3D) Poynting vector visualisation technology. It\ndemonstrates that the 3D distribution and number of Poynting vector vortexes\nproduced by the particle highly affect the shapes and bending directions of the\nphotonic hooks causing the near-field switching, and multiple independent\nhigh-magnitude areas matched by the regional Poynting vector streamlines can\nform these photonic hooks. The corresponding mechanism can only be represented\nby 3D Poynting vector distributions and is being reported for the first time.",

      "abstract": "We study market-consistent valuation of liability cash flows motivated by\ncurrent regulatory frameworks for the insurance industry. Building on the\ntheory on multiple-prior optimal stopping we propose a valuation functional\nwith sound economic properties that applies to any liability cash flow. Whereas\na replicable cash flow is assigned the market value of the replicating\nportfolio, a cash flow that is not fully replicable is assigned a value which\nis the sum of the market value of a replicating portfolio and a positive\nmargin. The margin is a direct consequence of considering a hypothetical\ntransfer of the liability cash flow from an insurance company to an empty\ncorporate entity set up with the sole purpose to manage the liability run-off,\nsubject to repeated capital requirements, and considering the valuation of this\nentity from the owner's perspective taking model uncertainty into account.\nAiming for applicability, we consider a detailed insurance application and\nexplain how the optimisation problems over sets of probability measures can be\ncast as simpler optimisation problems over parameter sets corresponding to\nparameterised density processes appearing in applications.",

      "abstract": "Graphene grown via chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on copper foil has\nemerged as a high-quality, scalable material, that can be easily integrated on\ntechnologically relevant platforms to develop promising applications in the\nfields of optoelectronics and photonics. Most of these applications require\nlow-contaminated high-mobility graphene (i.e., approaching 10 000 $cm^2 V^{-1}\ns^{-1}$) at room temperature) to reduce device losses and implement compact\ndevice design. To date, these mobility values are only obtained when suspending\nor encapsulating graphene. Here, we demonstrate a rapid, facile, and scalable\ncleaning process, that yields high-mobility graphene directly on the most\ncommon technologically relevant substrate: silicon dioxide on silicon\n(SiO$_2$/Si). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and spatially-resolved X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrate that this approach is instrumental\nto rapidly eliminate most of the polymeric residues which remain on graphene\nafter transfer and fabrication and that have adverse effects on its electrical\nproperties. Raman measurements show a significant reduction of graphene doping\nand strain. Transport measurements of 50 Hall bars (HBs) yield hole mobility\n${\\mu}_h$ up to 9000 $cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}$ and electron mobility ${\\mu}_e$ up to\n8000 $cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}$, with average values ${\\mu}_h$ 7500 $cm^2 V^{-1}\ns^{-1}$ and ${\\mu}_e$ 6300 $cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}$. The carrier mobility of\nultraclean graphene reach values nearly double of that measured in graphene HBs\nprocessed with acetone cleaning, which is the method widely adopted in the\nfield. Notably, these mobility values are obtained over large-scale and without\nencapsulation, thus paving the way to the adoption of graphene in\noptoelectronics and photonics.",

Using the arm averaged model of the MMC, the\ninstantaneous power for the upper and lower arms of the converter is obtained,\ngiving the basis to describe the instantaneous energy of the arms. To calculate\nthe SM capacitors peak voltage values, it is required to obtain an analytic\nexpression for the maximum and minimum energy levels. Due to the presence of\nterms with different magnitudes, frequencies and phases, finding it can be\nquite challenging. To overcome this issue, the instantaneous arm energy\nexpression is modified using mathematical assumptions in order to join the\ndifferent components into a single term which can analytically describes the\nmaximum energy point. Then, this expression is used to calculate the peak\nvalues of the arm capacitor voltages. By employing the same principles from the\narm level, the final analytical expression for the SM capacitors maximum and\nminimum voltages is found.

To fill this gap, we study\ncharacterization of risk measures induced by efficient insurance contracts,\ni.e., those that are Pareto optimal for the insured and the insurer. One of our\nmajor results is that we characterize a mixture of the mean and ES as the risk\nmeasure of the insured and the insurer, when contracts with deductibles are\nefficient.

A transmon qubit is created with two superconducting islands\ncoupled with two Josephson Junction embedded into a transmission line. The\ntransmon qubit energies are manipulated through its coupling to the\ntransmission line. The key factor here is the coupling factor between\ntransmission line and qubit by which the quantum features of the system such as\ntransmon decay rate, energy dispersion, and related coherence time are\ncontrolled. To complete knowledge about the design, the system is quantum\nmechanically analyzed and the related Hamiltonian is derived. Accordingly, the\ndynamics equation of motions is derived and so the energy dispersion and the\ncoupled system coherence time are investigated. The system engineering should\nbe established in such a way that satisfies the energy dispersion and the\ncoherence time. However, to analyze the entanglement between modes, it needs to\ncalculate the number of photons of the transmission lines and the transmon\nqubit, and also the phase sensitive cross-correlation. The important section of\nthis study emphasizes on engineering the coupling between the transmon qubit\nand transmission line to enhance the entanglement. The results show that around\nthe Josephson Junction location where the more coupling is established the more\nentanglement between modes is created.",

In structured\nargumentation the way an argument is constructed, by chaining inference rules\nstarting from premises, is taken into consideration. In this paper we study\nmethods for assigning an argument its intrinsic strength, based on the\nstrengths of the premises and inference rules used to form said argument.

Two different\nproxies have been used to represent different levels of reconnection in the\nnear-Earth tail: The value of the AL index and the substorm phases identified\nby the Substorm Onsets and Phases from Indices of the Electrojet algorithm. We\nfind that the convection changes from a dominantly Y$_{GSM}$direction, but\nopposite in the two hemispheres, to a flow oriented more toward the plasma\nsheet, as the north-south component of the convection increases when\nreconnection enhances in the near Earth tail. This result is consistent with\nrecent observations of the convection in the ionosphere, which suggest that the\nnightside convection pattern becomes more north-south symmetric when tail\nreconnection increases. This is also supported by simultaneous auroral\nobservations from the two hemispheres, which shows that conjugate auroral\nfeatures become more symmetric during substorm expansion phase. The reduced\nasymmetry implies that the asymmetric pressure balance in the lobes is altered\nduring periods with strong reconnection in the near-Earth tail.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a novel anytime Batched Thompson sampling policy for multi-armed\nbandits where the agent observes the rewards of her actions and adjusts her\npolicy only at the end of a small number of batches. We show that this policy\nsimultaneously achieves a problem dependent regret of order $O(\\log(T))$ and a\nminimax regret of order $O(\\sqrt{T\\log(T)})$ while the number of batches can be\nbounded by $O(\\log(T))$ independent of the problem instance over a time horizon\n$T$. We also show that in expectation the number of batches used by our policy\ncan be bounded by an instance dependent bound of order $O(\\log\\log(T))$. These\nresults indicate that Thompson sampling maintains the same performance in this\nbatched setting as in the case when instantaneous feedback is available after\neach action, while requiring minimal feedback. These results also indicate that\nThompson sampling performs competitively with recently proposed algorithms\ntailored for the batched setting. These algorithms optimize the batch structure\nfor a given time horizon $T$ and prioritize exploration in the beginning of the\nexperiment to eliminate suboptimal actions. We show that Thompson sampling\ncombined with an adaptive batching strategy can achieve a similar performance\nwithout knowing the time horizon $T$ of the problem and without having to\ncarefully optimize the batch structure to achieve a target regret bound (i.e.\nproblem dependent vs minimax regret) for a given $T$.",

      "abstract": "Recently, brain-inspired computing models have shown great potential to\noutperform today's deep learning solutions in terms of robustness and energy\nefficiency. Particularly, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and HyperDimensional\nComputing (HDC) have shown promising results in enabling efficient and robust\ncognitive learning. Despite the success, these two brain-inspired models have\ndifferent strengths. While SNN mimics the physical properties of the human\nbrain, HDC models the brain on a more abstract and functional level. Their\ndesign philosophies demonstrate complementary patterns that motivate their\ncombination. With the help of the classical psychological model on memory, we\npropose SpikeHD, the first framework that fundamentally combines Spiking neural\nnetwork and hyperdimensional computing. SpikeHD generates a scalable and strong\ncognitive learning system that better mimics brain functionality. SpikeHD\nexploits spiking neural networks to extract low-level features by preserving\nthe spatial and temporal correlation of raw event-based spike data. Then, it\nutilizes HDC to operate over SNN output by mapping the signal into\nhigh-dimensional space, learning the abstract information, and classifying the\ndata. Our extensive evaluation on a set of benchmark classification problems\nshows that SpikeHD provides the following benefit compared to SNN architecture:\n(1) significantly enhance learning capability by exploiting two-stage\ninformation processing, (2) enables substantial robustness to noise and\nfailure, and (3) reduces the network size and required parameters to learn\ncomplex information.",

      "abstract": "An effective unsupervised hashing algorithm leads to compact binary codes\npreserving the neighborhood structure of data as much as possible. One of the\nmost established schemes for unsupervised hashing is to reduce the\ndimensionality of data and then find a rigid (neighbourhood-preserving)\ntransformation that reduces the quantization error. Although employing rigid\ntransformations is effective, we may not reduce quantization loss to the\nultimate limits. As well, reducing dimensionality and quantization loss in two\nseparate steps seems to be sub-optimal. Motivated by these shortcomings, we\npropose to employ both rigid and non-rigid transformations to reduce\nquantization error and dimensionality simultaneously. We relax the\northogonality constraint on the projection in a PCA-formulation and regularize\nthis by a quantization term. We show that both the non-rigid projection matrix\nand rotation matrix contribute towards minimizing quantization loss but in\ndifferent ways. A scalable nested coordinate descent approach is proposed to\noptimize this mixed-integer optimization problem. We evaluate the proposed\nmethod on five public benchmark datasets providing almost half a million\nimages. Comparative results indicate that the proposed method mostly\noutperforms state-of-art linear methods and competes with end-to-end deep\nsolutions.",

      "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data has become a critical component in\nensuring the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world.\nExisting OOD detection approaches primarily rely on the output or feature space\nfor deriving OOD scores, while largely overlooking information from the\ngradient space. In this paper, we present GradNorm, a simple and effective\napproach for detecting OOD inputs by utilizing information extracted from the\ngradient space. GradNorm directly employs the vector norm of gradients,\nbackpropagated from the KL divergence between the softmax output and a uniform\nprobability distribution. Our key idea is that the magnitude of gradients is\nhigher for in-distribution (ID) data than that for OOD data, making it\ninformative for OOD detection. GradNorm demonstrates superior performance,\nreducing the average FPR95 by up to 16.33% compared to the previous best\nmethod.",

      "abstract": "A neural networks (NN) compensator is designed for systems with multi-segment\npiecewise-linear nonlinearities. The compensator uses the back stepping\ntechnique with NN for inverting the multi-segment piecewise-linear\nnonlinearities in the feedforward path. This scheme provides a general\nprocedure for determining the dynamic pre-inversion of an invertible dynamic\nsystem using NN. A tuning algorithm is presented for the NN compensator which\nyields a stable closed-loop system. In the case of nonlinear stability proofs,\nthe tracking error is small. It is noted that PI controller without NN\ncompensation requires much higher gain to achieve same performance. It is also\ndifficult to ensure the stability of such highly nonlinear systems using only\nPI controllers. Using NN compensation, stability of the system is proven, and\ntracking errors can be arbitrarily kept small by increasing the gain. The NN\nweight errors are basically bounded in terms of input weight and hidden weight.\nSimulation results show the effectiveness of the piecewise linear NN\ncompensator in the system. This scheme is applicable to xy table-like servo\nsystem and shows neural network stability proofs. In addition, the NN piecewise\nlinear nonlinearity compensation can be further and applied to backlash,\nhysteresis, and another actuator nonlinear compensation.",

      "abstract": "During the late stage of terrestrial planet formation, hit-and-run collisions\nare about as common as accretionary mergers, for expected velocities and angles\nof giant impacts. Average hit-and-runs leave two major remnants plus debris:\nthe target and impactor, somewhat modified through erosion, escaping at lower\nrelative velocity. Here we continue our study of the dynamical effects of such\ncollisions. We compare the dynamical fates of intact runners that start from\nhit-and-runs with proto-Venus at 0.7 AU and proto-Earth at 1.0 AU. We follow\nthe orbital evolutions of the runners, including the other terrestrial planets,\nJupiter, and Saturn, in an N-body code. We find that the accretion of these\nrunners can take $\\gtrsim$10 Myr (depending on the egress velocity of the first\ncollision) and can involve successive collisions with the original target\nplanet or with other planets. We treat successive collisions that the runner\nexperiences using surrogate models from machine learning, as in previous work,\nand evolve subsequent hit-and-runs in a similar fashion. We identify\nasymmetries in the capture, loss, and interchange of runners in the growth of\nVenus and Earth. Hit-and-run is a more probable outcome at proto-Venus, being\nsmaller and faster orbiting than proto-Earth. But Venus acts as a sink,\neventually accreting most of its runners, assuming typical events, whereas\nproto-Earth loses about half, many of those continuing to Venus. This leads to\na disparity in the style of late-stage accretion that could have led to\nsignificant differences in geology, composition, and satellite formation at\nEarth and Venus.",

      "abstract": "In the canonical model of Moon formation, a Mars-sized protoplanet \"Theia\"\ncollides with proto-Earth at close to their mutual escape velocity $v_{\\rm\nesc}$ and a common impact angle 45{\\deg}. The \"graze-and-merge\" collision\nstrands a fraction of Theia's mantle into orbit, while Earth accretes most of\nTheia and its momentum. Simulations show that this produces a hot, high angular\nmomentum, silicate-dominated protolunar system, in substantial agreement with\nlunar geology, geochemistry, and dynamics. However, a Moon that derives mostly\nfrom Theia's mantle, as angular momentum dictates, is challenged by the fact\nthat O, Ti, Cr, radiogenic W, and other elements are indistinguishable in Earth\nand lunar rocks. Moreover, the model requires an improbably low initial\nvelocity. Here we develop a scenario for Moon formation that begins with a\nsomewhat faster collision, when proto-Theia impacts proto-Earth at ~1.2 $v_{\\rm\nesc}$, also around 45{\\deg}. Instead of merging, the bodies come into violent\ncontact for a half-hour and their major components escape, a \"hit-and-run\ncollision.\" N-body evolutions show that the \"runner\" often returns ~0.1-1 Myr\nlater for a second giant impact, closer to $v_{\\rm esc}$; this produces a\npostimpact disk of ~2-3 lunar masses in smoothed particle hydrodynamics\nsimulations, with angular momentum comparable to canonical scenarios. The disk\nends up substantially inclined, in most cases, because the terminal collision\nis randomly oriented to the first. Proto-Earth contributions to the silicate\ndisk are enhanced by the compounded mixing and greater energy of a collision\nchain.",

For the case of fast and high throughput application, It\nis essential to minimize the cost of operations and the time of operations and\nthat is why one of the most challenging and important phase is sample\npreparation. In our proposed algorithm, we have hide to reduce sample droplets\nand waste droplets and for this purpose waste recycling is used, when different\nseries of multi gradient targets concentration factors (CFS) are generated. We\nhave compared our proposed algorithm with recent dilution techniques such as\nMTC, REMIA, and WARA. For the storage of intermediate droplets which, and\ngenerated during this process, on chip storage space 0(n) is needed.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we address the real-time risk-bounded safety verification\nproblem of continuous-time state trajectories of autonomous systems in the\npresence of uncertain time-varying nonlinear safety constraints. Risk is\ndefined as the probability of not satisfying the uncertain safety constraints.\nExisting approaches to address the safety verification problems under\nuncertainties either are limited to particular classes of uncertainties and\nsafety constraints, e.g., Gaussian uncertainties and linear constraints, or\nrely on sampling based methods. In this paper, we provide a fast convex\nalgorithm to efficiently evaluate the probabilistic nonlinear safety\nconstraints in the presence of arbitrary probability distributions and long\nplanning horizons in real-time, without the need for uncertainty samples and\ntime discretization. The provided approach verifies the safety of the given\nstate trajectory and its neighborhood (tube) to account for the execution\nuncertainties and risk. In the provided approach, we first use the moments of\nthe probability distributions of the uncertainties to transform the\nprobabilistic safety constraints into a set of deterministic safety\nconstraints. We then use convex methods based on sum-of-squares polynomials to\nverify the obtained deterministic safety constraints over the entire planning\ntime horizon without time discretization. To illustrate the performance of the\nproposed method, we apply the provided method to the safety verification\nproblem of self-driving vehicles and autonomous aerial vehicles.",

      "abstract": "Object permanence in psychology means knowing that objects still exist even\nif they are no longer visible. It is a crucial concept for robots to operate\nautonomously in uncontrolled environments. Existing approaches learn object\npermanence from low-level perception, but perform poorly on more complex\nscenarios, like when objects are contained and carried by others. Knowledge\nabout manipulation actions performed on an object prior to its disappearance\nallows us to reason about its location, e.g., that the object has been placed\nin a carrier. In this paper we argue that object permanence can be improved\nwhen the robot uses knowledge about executed actions and describe an approach\nto infer hidden object states from agent actions. We show that considering\nagent actions not only improves rule-based reasoning models but also purely\nneural approaches, showing its general applicability. Then, we conduct\nquantitative experiments on a snitch localization task using a dataset of 1,371\nsynthesized videos, where we compare the performance of different object\npermanence models with and without action annotations. We demonstrate that\nmodels with action annotations can significantly increase performance of both\nneural and rule-based approaches. Finally, we evaluate the usability of our\napproach in real-world applications by conducting qualitative experiments with\ntwo Universal Robots (UR5 and UR16e) in both lab and industrial settings. The\nrobots complete benchmark tasks for a gearbox assembly and demonstrate the\nobject permanence capabilities with real sensor data in an industrial\nenvironment.",

      "abstract": "We present an alternative formulation of quantum decoherence theory using\nconditional wave theory (CWT), which was originally developed in molecular\nphysics (also known as exact factorisation methods). We formulate a CWT of a\nclassic model of collisional decoherence of a free particle with environmental\nparticles treated in a long-wavelength limit. In general, the CWT equation of\nmotion for the particle is non-linear, where the non-linearity enters via the\nCWT gauge fields. For Gaussian wave packets the analytic solutions of the CWT\nequations are in exact agreement with those from the density matrix formalism.\nWe show that CWT gauge terms that determine the dynamics of the particle's\nmarginal wave function are related to a Taylor series expansion of the\nparticle's reduced density matrix. Approximate solutions to these equations\nlead to a linear-time approximation that reproduces the ensemble width in the\nlimits of both short and long times, in addition to reproducing the long-term\nbehaviour of the coherence length. With this approximation, the non-linear\nequation of motion for the particle's marginal wave function can be written in\nthe form of the logarithmic Schr\\\"odinger equation. The CWT formalism may lead\nto computationally efficient calculations of quantum decoherence, since it\ninvolves working with wave-function level terms instead of evolving a density\nmatrix via a master equation.",

      "abstract": "We study adapting trained object detectors to unseen domains manifesting\nsignificant variations of object appearance, viewpoints and backgrounds. Most\ncurrent methods align domains by either using image or instance-level feature\nalignment in an adversarial fashion. This often suffers due to the presence of\nunwanted background and as such lacks class-specific alignment. A common remedy\nto promote class-level alignment is to use high confidence predictions on the\nunlabelled domain as pseudo labels. These high confidence predictions are often\nfallacious since the model is poorly calibrated under domain shift. In this\npaper, we propose to leverage model predictive uncertainty to strike the right\nbalance between adversarial feature alignment and class-level alignment.\nSpecifically, we measure predictive uncertainty on class assignments and the\nbounding box predictions. Model predictions with low uncertainty are used to\ngenerate pseudo-labels for self-supervision, whereas the ones with higher\nuncertainty are used to generate tiles for an adversarial feature alignment\nstage. This synergy between tiling around the uncertain object regions and\ngenerating pseudo-labels from highly certain object regions allows us to\ncapture both the image and instance level context during the model adaptation\nstage. We perform extensive experiments covering various domain shift\nscenarios. Our approach improves upon existing state-of-the-art methods with\nvisible margins.",

      "abstract": "Security function outsourcing has witnessed both research and deployment in\nthe recent years. While most existing services take a straight-forward approach\nof cloud hosting, on-path transit networks (such as ISPs) are increasingly more\ninterested in offering outsourced security services to end users. Recent\nproposals (such as SafeBricks and mbTLS) have made it possible to outsource\nsensitive security applications to untrusted, arbitrary networks, rendering\non-path security function outsourcing more promising than ever. However, to\nprovide on-path security function outsourcing, there is one crucial component\nthat is still missing -- a practical end-to-end network protocol. Thus, the\ndiscovery and orchestration of multiple capable and willing transit networks\nfor user-requested security functions have only been assumed in many studies\nwithout any practical solutions. In this work, we propose Opsec, an end-to-end\nsecurity-outsourcing protocol that fills this gap and brings us closer to the\nvision of on-path security function outsourcing. Opsec automatically discovers\none or more transit ISPs between a client and a server, and requests\nuser-specified security functions efficiently. When designing Opsec, we\nprioritize the practicality and applicability of this new end-to-end protocol\nin the current Internet. Our proof-of-concept implementation of Opsec for web\nsessions shows that an end user can easily start a new web session with a few\nclicks of a browser plug-in, to specify a series of security functions of her\nchoice. We show that it is possible to implement such a new end-to-end service\nmodel in the current Internet for the majority of the web services without any\nmajor changes to the standard protocols (e.g., TCP, TLS, HTTP) and the existing\nnetwork infrastructure (e.g., ISP's routing primitives).",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the use of a deep multi-layer perceptron\narchitecture to classify received signals as one of seven common waveforms,\nsingle carrier (SC), single-carrier frequency division multiple access\n(SC-FDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), linear frequency\nmodulation (LFM), amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and\nphase-coded pulse modulation used in communication and radar networks.\nSynchronization of the signals is not needed as we assume there is an unknown\nand uncompensated time and frequency offset. The classifier is open-set meaning\nit assumes unknown waveforms may appear. Isolation forest (IF) models acting as\nbinary classifiers are used for each known signal class to perform detection of\npossible unknown signals. This is accomplished using the 32-length feature\nvector from a dense layer as input to the IF models. The classifier and IF\nmodels work together to monitor the spectrum and identify waveforms along with\ndetecting unknown waveforms. Results showed the classifier had 100%\nclassification rate above 0 dB with an accuracy of 83.2% and 94.7% at -10 dB\nand -5 dB, respectively, with signal impairments present. Results for the IF\nmodels showed an overall accuracy of 98% when detecting known and unknown\nsignals with signal impairments present. IF models were able to reject all\nunknown signals while signals similar to known signals were able to pass\nthrough 2% of the time due to the contamination rate used during training.\nOverall, the entire system can classify correctly in an open-set mode with 98%\naccuracy at SNR greater than 0 dB.",

      "abstract": "Quantum sensing and quantum information processing use quantum advantages\nsuch as squeezed states that encode a quantity of interest with higher\nprecision and generate quantum correlations to outperform classical methods. In\nharmonic oscillators, the rate of generating squeezing is set by a quantum\nspeed limit. Therefore, the degree to which a quantum advantage can be used in\npractice is limited by the time needed to create the state relative to the rate\nof unavoidable decoherence. Alternatively, a sudden change of harmonic\noscillator's frequency projects a ground state into a squeezed state which can\ncircumvent the time constraint. Here, we create squeezed states of atomic\nmotion by sudden changes of the harmonic oscillation frequency of atoms in an\noptical lattice. Building on this protocol, we demonstrate rapid quantum\namplification of a displacement operator that could be used for detecting\nmotion. Our results can speed up quantum gates and enable quantum sensing and\nquantum information processing in noisy environments.",

      "abstract": "In-time and accurate assessments of on-road vehicle emissions play a central\nrole in urban air quality and health policymaking. However, official insight is\nhampered by the Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) procedure conducted in the\nlaboratory annually. It not only has a large gap to real-world situations\n(e.g., meteorological conditions) but also is incapable of regular supervision.\nHere we build a unique dataset including 103831 light-duty gasoline vehicles,\nin which on-road remote sensing (ORRS) measurements are linked to the I/M\nrecords based on the vehicle identification numbers and license plates. On this\nbasis, we develop an ensemble model framework that integrates three machining\nlearning algorithms, including neural network (NN), extreme gradient boosting\n(XGBoost), and random forest (RF). We demonstrate that this ensemble model\ncould rapidly assess the vehicle-specific emissions (i.e., CO, HC, and NO). In\nparticular, the model performs quite well for the passing vehicles under normal\nconditions (i.e., lower VSP (< 18 kw/t), temperature (6 ~ 32 {\\deg}C), relative\nhumidity (< 80%), and wind speed (< 5m/s)). Together with the current emission\nstandard, we identify a large number of the dirty (2.33%) or clean (74.92%)\nvehicles in the real world. Our results show that the ORRS measurements,\nassisted by the machine-learning-based ensemble model developed here, can\nrealize day-to-day supervision of on-road vehicle-specific emissions. This\napproach framework provides a valuable opportunity to reform the I/M procedures\nglobally and mitigate urban air pollution deeply.",

Now it is a universally\nobserved order like the antiferromagnetic and the superconducting orders of the\ncuprates. The charge order shows up in various forms depending on materials,\nand it overlaps other orders in the phase diagram. Because of this diversity\nand complexity it has been far from clear whether or not the charge order has a\ndirect relevance to superconductivity and to the mysterious pseudogap\nphenomenon. However, the research development in the last few years has been\nsuccessful in revealing universal aspects of the charge order and its\nfluctuations. It turns out that the charge order is compatible with\nsuperconductivity, and that its fluctuations have high onset temperature and\nhigh energy scale comparable to those of the pseudogap. The charge order\ncorrelations might be indispensable for creating the pseudogap and possibly\ngenerating high-Tc superconductivity by collaborating with spin and pairing\ncorrelations.",

      "abstract": "The conventional design of wireless communication systems typically relies on\nestablished mathematical models that capture the characteristics of different\ncommunication modules. Unfortunately, such design cannot be easily and directly\napplied to future wireless networks, which will be characterized by large-scale\nultra-dense networks whose design complexity scales exponentially with the\nnetwork size. Furthermore, such networks will vary dynamically in a significant\nway, which makes it intractable to develop comprehensive analytical models.\nRecently, deep learning-based approaches have emerged as potential alternatives\nfor designing complex and dynamic wireless systems. However, existing\nlearning-based methods have limited capabilities to scale with the problem size\nand to generalize with varying network settings. In this paper, we propose a\nscalable and generalizable neural calibration framework for future wireless\nsystem design, where a neural network is adopted to calibrate the input of\nconventional model-based algorithms. Specifically, the backbone of a\ntraditional time-efficient algorithm is integrated with deep neural networks to\nachieve a high computational efficiency, while enjoying enhanced performance.\nThe permutation equivariance property, carried out by the topological structure\nof wireless systems, is furthermore utilized to develop a generalizable neural\nnetwork architecture. The proposed neural calibration framework is applied to\nsolve challenging resource management problems in massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) systems. Simulation results will show that the proposed\nneural calibration approach enjoys significantly improved scalability and\ngeneralization compared with the existing learning-based methods.",

Our leading design principle is to cleanly separate architecture,\nprior, inference and likelihood specification, allowing for a flexible workflow\nwhere users can quickly iterate over combinations of these components. In\ncontrast to existing packages TyXe does not implement any layer classes, and\ninstead relies on architectures defined in generic Pytorch code. TyXe then\nprovides modular choices for canonical priors, variational guides, inference\ntechniques, and layer selections for a Bayesian treatment of the specified\narchitecture. Sampling tricks for variance reduction, such as local\nreparameterization or flipout, are implemented as effect handlers, which can be\napplied independently of other specifications. We showcase the ease of use of\nTyXe to explore Bayesian versions of popular models from various libraries: toy\nregression with a pure Pytorch neural network; large-scale image classification\nwith torchvision ResNets; graph neural networks based on DGL; and Neural\nRadiance Fields built on top of Pytorch3D. Finally, we provide convenient\nabstractions for variational continual learning. In all cases the change from a\ndeterministic to a Bayesian neural network comes with minimal modifications to\nexisting code, offering a broad range of researchers and practitioners alike\npractical access to uncertainty estimation techniques.

      "abstract": "Today's robots are increasingly interacting with people and need to\nefficiently learn inexperienced user's preferences. A common framework is to\niteratively query the user about which of two presented robot trajectories they\nprefer. While this minimizes the users effort, a strict choice does not yield\nany information on how much one trajectory is preferred. We propose scale\nfeedback, where the user utilizes a slider to give more nuanced information. We\nintroduce a probabilistic model on how users would provide feedback and derive\na learning framework for the robot. We demonstrate the performance benefit of\nslider feedback in simulations, and validate our approach in two user studies\nsuggesting that scale feedback enables more effective learning in practice.",

      "abstract": "The training of sparse neural networks is becoming an increasingly important\ntool for reducing the computational footprint of models at training and\nevaluation, as well enabling the effective scaling up of models. Whereas much\nwork over the years has been dedicated to specialised pruning techniques,\nlittle attention has been paid to the inherent effect of gradient based\ntraining on model sparsity. In this work, we introduce Powerpropagation, a new\nweight-parameterisation for neural networks that leads to inherently sparse\nmodels. Exploiting the behaviour of gradient descent, our method gives rise to\nweight updates exhibiting a \"rich get richer\" dynamic, leaving low-magnitude\nparameters largely unaffected by learning. Models trained in this manner\nexhibit similar performance, but have a distribution with markedly higher\ndensity at zero, allowing more parameters to be pruned safely. Powerpropagation\nis general, intuitive, cheap and straight-forward to implement and can readily\nbe combined with various other techniques. To highlight its versatility, we\nexplore it in two very different settings: Firstly, following a recent line of\nwork, we investigate its effect on sparse training for resource-constrained\nsettings. Here, we combine Powerpropagation with a traditional weight-pruning\ntechnique as well as recent state-of-the-art sparse-to-sparse algorithms,\nshowing superior performance on the ImageNet benchmark. Secondly, we advocate\nthe use of sparsity in overcoming catastrophic forgetting, where compressed\nrepresentations allow accommodating a large number of tasks at fixed model\ncapacity. In all cases our reparameterisation considerably increases the\nefficacy of the off-the-shelf methods.",

So, efficient means of rejectingthe non-cosmic-ray noise and\nidentification of signals attributable to extensive air showers arenecessary.\nTo address these problems we discuss a Convolutional Neural Network-based\nmethod ofartefact rejection and complementary method of particle identification\nbased on common statisticalclassifiers as well as their ensemble extensions.\nThese approaches are based on supervised learning,so we need to provide a\nrepresentative subset of the CREDO dataset for training and\nvalidation.According to this approach over 2300 images were chosen and manually\nlabeled by 5 judges.The images were split into spot, track, worm (collectively\nnamed signals) and artefact classes.Then the preprocessing consisting of\nluminance summation of RGB channels (grayscaling) andbackground removal by\nadaptive thresholding was performed. For purposes of artefact rejectionthe\nbinary CNN-based classifier was proposed which is able to distinguish between\nartefacts andsignals. The classifier was fed with input data in the form of\nDaubechies wavelet transformedimages. In the case of cosmic ray signal\nclassification, the well-known feature-based classifierswere considered. As\nfeature descriptors, we used Zernike moments with additional feature relatedto\ntotal image luminance. For the problem of artefact rejection, we obtained an\naccuracy of 99%.

      "abstract": "In recent years, CCD-in-CMOS TDI image sensors are becoming increasingly\npopular for many small satellite missions to assure a fast and affordable\naccess to space for Low Earth Observation. Our monolithic CCD-in-CMOS TDI\nimager features a specifically developed technology which combines the benefits\nof a classical CCD TDI with the advantages of CMOS System-On-a-Chip (SoC)\ndesign. Like CCD, this detector is also controlled by a large number of clock\nvoltages. Optimizing these voltages allows to increase the performance of the\ndetector by improving multiple characteristic parameters, such as full well\ncapacity (FWC), dark current, linearity, dark signal non-uniformity (DSNU) and\ncharge transfer efficiency (CTE). Traditionally, it has been the standard\npractice to adjust the CCD voltages by trial and error methods to get a better\nimage. Because of the large parameter space, such subjective procedures may\nyield far from the optimum performance. This paper reports a design of\nexperiments (DOE) technique applied on the clock voltages to improve the\nmultiple performance parameters of the detector. This method utilizes the\nTaguchi's orthogonal arrays of experiments to reduce the number of experiments\nwith different voltage combinations. Finally, optimal combination of clock\nvoltages is obtained by converting the multiple performance parameters of the\ndetector into a single Grey relational grade. In this process, the sequences of\nobtaining parameter values are categorized according to the performance\ncharacteristics. The condition Higher-the-better is used for parameters like\nFWC and CTE whereas condition Lower-the-better is applied for parameters, such\nas dark current, linearity error and DSNU.",

      "abstract": "The low density nuclear matter equation of state is strongly constrained by\nnuclear properties, however, for constraining the high density equation of\nstate it is necessary to resort to indirect information obtained from the\nobservation of neutron stars, compact objects that may have a central density\nseveral times nuclear matter saturation density, $n_0$. Taking a meta-modelling\napproach to generate a huge set of equation of state that satisfy nuclear\nmatter properties close to $n_0$ and that do not contain a first order phase\ntransition, the possibility of constraining the high density equation of state\nwas investigated. The entire information obtained from the GW170817 event for\nthe probability distribution of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ was used to make a\nprobabilistic inference of the EOS, which goes beyond the constraints imposed\nby nuclear matter properties. Nuclear matter properties close to saturation,\nbelow $2n_0$, do not allow us to distinguish between equations of state that\npredict different neutron star (NS) maximum masses. This is, however, not true\nif the equation of state is constrained at low densities by the tidal\ndeformability of the NS merger associated to GW170817. Above $3n_0$,\ndifferences may be large, for both approaches, and, in particular, the pressure\nand speed of sound of the sets studied do not overlap, showing that the\nknowledge of the NS maximum mass may give important information on the high\ndensity EOS. Narrowing the maximum mass uncertainty interval will have a\nsizeable effect on constraining the high density EOS.",

Therefore, to determine the\nthermodynamically stable structure, we use a recently introduced on-the-fly\nMachine-Learning Force Field method, which reduces the computation time from\nyears to days. The molecules exhibit a large degree of anharmonic motion\ndepending on temperature: i.e. rattling, twisting and tumbling. We observe the\ncrystal's 'librational pathways' while slowly heating it in isothermal-isobaric\nsimulations. Marked differences in the thermal evolution of structural\nparameters allow us to determine the real structure of the system via a\ncomparison with experimentally determined crystal structures.",

A genetic algorithm (GA)-based parameter estimation method is employed\nto determine the system parameters, which leads to a very accurate simulation\nof the model.

      "abstract": "Knowledge distillation usually transfers the knowledge from a pre-trained\ncumbersome teacher network to a compact student network, which follows the\nclassical teacher-teaching-student paradigm. Based on this paradigm, previous\nmethods mostly focus on how to efficiently train a better student network for\ndeployment. Different from the existing practices, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel student-helping-teacher formula, Teacher Evolution via Self-Knowledge\nDistillation (TESKD), where the target teacher (for deployment) is learned with\nthe help of multiple hierarchical students by sharing the structural backbone.\nThe diverse feedback from multiple students allows the teacher to improve\nitself through the shared feature representations. The effectiveness of our\nproposed framework is demonstrated by extensive experiments with various\nnetwork settings on two standard benchmarks including CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.\nNotably, when trained together with our proposed method, ResNet-18 achieves\n79.15% and 71.14% accuracy on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, outperforming the\nbaseline results by 4.74% and 1.43%, respectively.

The evaluation period of the competition was the occasion of trial\nand error and we put the focus on the final forecasting procedure.

Aiming to further promote image captioning by\ntransformers, this paper proposes an improved Geometry Attention Transformer\n(GAT) model. In order to further leverage geometric information, two novel\ngeometry-aware architectures are designed respectively for the encoder and\ndecoder in our GAT. Besides, this model includes the two work modules: 1) a\ngeometry gate-controlled self-attention refiner, for explicitly incorporating\nrelative spatial information into image region representations in encoding\nsteps, and 2) a group of position-LSTMs, for precisely informing the decoder of\nrelative word position in generating caption texts.

      "abstract": "The current research focus in Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery\n(RAMIS) is directed towards increasing the level of robot autonomy, to place\nsurgeons in a supervisory position. Although Learning from Demonstrations (LfD)\napproaches are among the preferred ways for an autonomous surgical system to\nlearn expert gestures, they require a high number of demonstrations and show\npoor generalization to the variable conditions of the surgical environment. In\nthis work, we propose an LfD methodology based on Generative Adversarial\nImitation Learning (GAIL) that is built on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nsetting. GAIL combines generative adversarial networks to learn the\ndistribution of expert trajectories with a DRL setting to ensure generalisation\nof trajectories providing human-like behaviour. We consider automation of\ntissue retraction, a common RAMIS task that involves soft tissues manipulation\nto expose a region of interest. In our proposed methodology, a small set of\nexpert trajectories can be acquired through the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK)\nand used to train the proposed LfD method inside a simulated environment.\nResults indicate that our methodology can accomplish the tissue retraction task\nwith human-like behaviour while being more sample-efficient than the baseline\nDRL method. Towards the end, we show that the learnt policies can be\nsuccessfully transferred to the real robotic platform and deployed for soft\ntissue retraction on a synthetic phantom.",

      "abstract": "In the Internet of Things era, where we see many interconnected and\nheterogeneous mobile and fixed smart devices, distributing the intelligence\nfrom the cloud to the edge has become a necessity. Due to limited computational\nand communication capabilities, low memory and limited energy budget, bringing\nartificial intelligence algorithms to peripheral devices, such as the end-nodes\nof a sensor network, is a challenging task and requires the design of\ninnovative methods. In this work, we present PhiNets, a new scalable backbone\noptimized for deep-learning-based image processing on resource-constrained\nplatforms. PhiNets are based on inverted residual blocks specifically designed\nto decouple the computational cost, working memory, and parameter memory, thus\nexploiting all the available resources. With a YoloV2 detection head and Simple\nOnline and Realtime Tracking, the proposed architecture has achieved the\nstate-of-the-art results in (i) detection on the COCO and VOC2012 benchmarks,\nand (ii) tracking on the MOT15 benchmark. PhiNets reduce the parameter count of\n87% to 93% with respect to previous state-of-the-art models (EfficientNetv1,\nMobileNetv2) and achieve better performance with lower computational cost.\nMoreover, we demonstrate our approach on a prototype node based on a STM32H743\nmicrocontroller (MCU) with 2MB of internal Flash and 1MB of RAM and achieve\npower requirements in the order of 10 mW.

      "abstract": "Humans perform co-saliency detection by first summarizing the consensus\nknowledge in the whole group and then searching corresponding objects in each\nimage. Previous methods usually lack robustness, scalability, or stability for\nthe first process and simply fuse consensus features with image features for\nthe second process. In this paper, we propose a novel consensus-aware dynamic\nconvolution model to explicitly and effectively perform the \"summarize and\nsearch\" process. To summarize consensus image features, we first summarize\nrobust features for every single image using an effective pooling method and\nthen aggregate cross-image consensus cues via the self-attention mechanism. By\ndoing this, our model meets the scalability and stability requirements. Next,\nwe generate dynamic kernels from consensus features to encode the summarized\nconsensus knowledge. Two kinds of kernels are generated in a supplementary way\nto summarize fine-grained image-specific consensus object cues and the coarse\ngroup-wise common knowledge, respectively. Then, we can effectively perform\nobject searching by employing dynamic convolution at multiple scales. Besides,\na novel and effective data synthesis method is also proposed to train our\nnetwork. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed method. Our code and saliency maps are available\nat \\url{https://github.com/nnizhang/CADC}.",

However, such\nshorter wavelengths are susceptible to higher scattering and path loss forcing\nthe link to depend predominantly on the line-of-sight (LOS) path. Dynamic\nmovement of humans has been identified as a major source of blockages to such\nLOS links. In this work, we aim to overcome this challenge by predicting human\nblockages to the LOS link enabling the transmitter to anticipate the blockage\nand act intelligently. We propose an end-to-end system of\ninfrastructure-mounted LiDAR sensors to capture the dynamics of the\ncommunication environment visually, process the data with deep learning and ray\ncasting techniques to predict future blockages. Experiments indicate that the\nsystem achieves an accuracy of 87% predicting the upcoming blockages while\nmaintaining a precision of 78% and a recall of 79% for a window of 300 ms.",

      "abstract": "We propose a method combining boundary integral equations and neural networks\n(BINet) to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in both bounded and\nunbounded domains. Unlike existing solutions that directly operate over\noriginal PDEs, BINet learns to solve, as a proxy, associated boundary integral\nequations using neural networks. The benefits are three-fold. Firstly, only the\nboundary conditions need to be fitted since the PDE can be automatically\nsatisfied with single or double layer representations according to the\npotential theory. Secondly, the dimension of the boundary integral equations is\ntypically smaller, and as such, the sample complexity can be reduced\nsignificantly. Lastly, in the proposed method, all differential operators of\nthe original PDEs have been removed, hence the numerical efficiency and\nstability are improved. Adopting neural tangent kernel (NTK) techniques, we\nprovide proof of the convergence of BINets in the limit that the width of the\nneural network goes to infinity. Extensive numerical experiments show that,\nwithout calculating high-order derivatives, BINet is much easier to train and\nusually gives more accurate solutions, especially in the cases that the\nboundary conditions are not smooth enough. Further, BINet outperforms strong\nbaselines for both one single PDE and parameterized PDEs in the bounded and\nunbounded domains.",

      "abstract": "Composed of spatially distributed sensors and actuators that communicate\nthrough wireless networks, networked control systems are emerging as a\nfundamental infrastructure technology in 5G and IoT technologies, including\ndiverse applications, such as autonomous vehicles, UAVs, and various sensing\ndevices. In order to increase flexibility and reduce deployment and maintenance\ncosts, many such applications consider battery-powered or energy-harvesting\nnetworks, which bring additional limitations on the energy consumption of the\nwireless network. Specifically, the operation of battery-powered or\nenergy-harvesting wireless communication networks needs to guarantee (i)\nefficient communication between nodes and (ii) preservation of available\nenergy. Motivated by these novel requirements, in this paper, we present and\nanalyze a novel distributed average consensus algorithm, which (i) operates\nexclusively on quantized values (in order to guarantee efficient communication\nand data storage), and (ii) relies on event-driven updates (in order to reduce\nenergy consumption, communication bandwidth, network congestion, and/or\nprocessor usage). We characterize the properties of the proposed algorithm and\nshow that its execution, on any time-invariant and strongly connected digraph,\nwill allow all nodes to reach, in finite time, a common consensus value that is\nequal to the exact average (represented as the ratio of two quantized values).\nFurthermore, we show that our algorithm allows each node to cease transmissions\nonce the exact average of the initial quantized values has been reached (in\norder to preserve its battery energy). Then, we present upper bounds on (i) the\nnumber of transmissions and computations each node has to perform during the\nexecution of the algorithm, and (ii) the memory and energy requirements of each\nnode in order for the algorithm to be executed.",

In this work, we examine questions posed about open source software\nlicensing using data from the following Stack Exchange sites: Stack Overflow,\nSoftware Engineering, Open Source and Law. We analyse the indication of\nspecific licenses and topics in the questions, investigate the attention the\nposts receive and trends over time, whether appropriate answers are provided\nand which type of questions are asked. Our results indicate that practitioners\nneed, among other, clarifications about licensing specific software when other\nlicenses are used, and for understanding license content.

      "abstract": "Creating realistic characters that can react to the users' or another\ncharacter's movement can benefit computer graphics, games and virtual reality\nhugely. However, synthesizing such reactive motions in human-human interactions\nis a challenging task due to the many different ways two humans can interact.\nWhile there are a number of successful researches in adapting the generative\nadversarial network (GAN) in synthesizing single human actions, there are very\nfew on modelling human-human interactions. In this paper, we propose a\nsemi-supervised GAN system that synthesizes the reactive motion of a character\ngiven the active motion from another character. Our key insights are two-fold.\nFirst, to effectively encode the complicated spatial-temporal information of a\nhuman motion, we empower the generator with a part-based long short-term memory\n(LSTM) module, such that the temporal movement of different limbs can be\neffectively modelled. We further include an attention module such that the\ntemporal significance of the interaction can be learned, which enhances the\ntemporal alignment of the active-reactive motion pair. Second, as the reactive\nmotion of different types of interactions can be significantly different, we\nintroduce a discriminator that not only tells if the generated movement is\nrealistic or not, but also tells the class label of the interaction. This\nallows the use of such labels in supervising the training of the generator. We\nexperiment with the SBU and the HHOI datasets. The high quality of the\nsynthetic motion demonstrates the effective design of our generator, and the\ndiscriminability of the synthesis also demonstrates the strength of our\ndiscriminator.",

      "abstract": "Although residual connection enables training very deep neural networks, it\nis not friendly for online inference due to its multi-branch topology. This\nencourages many researchers to work on designing DNNs without residual\nconnections at inference. For example, RepVGG re-parameterizes multi-branch\ntopology to a VGG-like (single-branch) model when deploying, showing great\nperformance when the network is relatively shallow. However, RepVGG can not\ntransform ResNet to VGG equivalently because re-parameterizing methods can only\nbe applied to linear blocks and the non-linear layers (ReLU) have to be put\noutside of the residual connection which results in limited representation\nability, especially for deeper networks. In this paper, we aim to remedy this\nproblem and propose to remove the residual connection in a vanilla ResNet\nequivalently by a reserving and merging (RM) operation on ResBlock.\nSpecifically, the RM operation allows input feature maps to pass through the\nblock while reserving their information and merges all the information at the\nend of each block, which can remove residual connections without changing the\noriginal output. As a plug-in method, RM Operation basically has three\nadvantages: 1) its implementation makes it naturally friendly for high ratio\nnetwork pruning. 2) it helps break the depth limitation of RepVGG. 3) it leads\nto better accuracy-speed trade-off network (RMNet) compared to ResNet and\nRepVGG. We believe the ideology of RM Operation can inspire many insights on\nmodel design for the community in the future. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/fxmeng/RMNet.",

A Parker spiral\nmagnetic field, characteristic of a wind or jet, is consistent with the\nobserved EHT polarization pattern. Even though there is no image of the jet\nconnecting with the annulus, it is argued that these circumstances are not\ncoincidental and the polarized portion of the EHT emission is mainly jet\nemission in the top layers of the disk that is diluted by emission from an\nunderlying turbulent disk.

This paper proposes a successive addition-subtraction\nalgorithm to generate noise error permutations. A noise error patterns\ngeneration scheme is presented by embedding the \"1\" and \"0\" bursts alternately.\nThen detailed procedures of the proposed algorithm are presented, and its\ncorrectness is also demonstrated through theoretical derivations. The aim of\nthis work is to provide a preliminary paradigm and reference for future\nresearch on GRAND algorithm and hardware implementation.",

      "abstract": "Physics-based simulation has been actively employed in generating offline\nvisual effects in the film and animation industry. However, the computations\nrequired for high-quality scenarios are generally immense, deterring its\nadoption in real-time applications, e.g., virtual production, avatar\nlive-streaming, and cloud gaming. We summarize the principles that can\naccelerate the computation pipeline on single-GPU and multi-GPU platforms\nthrough extensive investigation and comprehension of modern GPU architecture.\nWe further demonstrate the effectiveness of these principles by applying them\nto the material point method to build up our framework, which achieves\n$1.7\\times$--$8.6\\times$ speedup on a single GPU and $2.5\\times$--$14.8\\times$\non four GPUs compared to the state-of-the-art. Our pipeline is specifically\ndesigned for real-time applications (i.e., scenarios with small to medium\nparticles) and achieves significant multi-GPU efficiency. We demonstrate our\npipeline by simulating a snow scenario with 1.33M particles and a fountain\nscenario with 143K particles in real-time (on average, 68.5 and 55.9\nframe-per-second, respectively) on four NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs interconnected\nwith NVLinks.",

      "abstract": "Social media platforms have been exploited to disseminate misinformation in\nrecent years. The widespread online misinformation has been shown to affect\nusers' beliefs and is connected to social impact such as polarization. In this\nwork, we focus on misinformation's impact on specific user behavior and aim to\nunderstand whether general Twitter users changed their behavior after being\nexposed to misinformation. We compare the before and after behavior of exposed\nusers to determine whether the frequency of the tweets they posted, or the\nsentiment of their tweets underwent any significant change. Our results\nindicate that users overall exhibited statistically significant changes in\nbehavior across some of these metrics. Through language distance analysis, we\nshow that exposed users were already different from baseline users before the\nexposure. We also study the characteristics of two specific user groups,\nmulti-exposure and extreme change groups, which were potentially highly\nimpacted. Finally, we study if the changes in the behavior of the users after\nexposure to misinformation tweets vary based on the number of their followers\nor the number of followers of the tweet authors, and find that their behavioral\nchanges are all similar.",

      "abstract": "It is notoriously difficult to securely configure HTTPS, and poor server\nconfigurations have contributed to several attacks including the FREAK, Logjam,\nand POODLE attacks. In this work, we empirically evaluate the TLS security\nposture of popular websites and endeavor to understand the configuration\ndecisions that operators make. We correlate several sources of influence on\nsites' security postures, including software defaults, cloud providers, and\nonline recommendations. We find a fragmented web ecosystem: while most websites\nhave secure configurations, this is largely due to major cloud providers that\noffer secure defaults. Individually configured servers are more often insecure\nthan not. This may be in part because common resources available to individual\noperators -- server software defaults and online configuration guides -- are\nfrequently insecure. Our findings highlight the importance of considering SaaS\nservices separately from individually-configured sites in measurement studies,\nand the need for server software to ship with secure defaults.",

We show, on the other hand, that the apparent horizon and the region\nnear r = 0 of an evaporating charged, rotating black hole are both timelike.\nThis implies that there exists a channel, via which classical or quantum\ninformation can escape to the outside, as the black hole evaporates. Since\nastrophysical black holes have at least some rotation, our results apply to all\nblack holes in nature. We discuss the implications of our result.",

      "title": "Compound eruptions of twin flux ropes in a solar active region",
      "abstract": "Compound eruptions represent that multiple closely spaced magnetic structures\nerupt consecutively within a short interval, and then lead to a single flare\nand a single CME. However, it is still subtle for the links between multiple\neruptions and the associated single flare or/and single CME. In this Letter, we\nreport the compound eruptions of twin close flux ropes (FR1 and FR2) within a\nfew minutes that resulted in a flare with a single soft X-ray peak and a CME\nwith two cores. The successive groups of expanding loops and double peaks of\nintensity flux in AIA cool wavelengths indicate two episodes of internal\nmagnetic reconnections during the compound eruptions. Following the eruption of\nFR2, the erupting FR1 was accelerated, and then the expanding loops overlying\nFR2 were deflected. Moreover, the eruption of FR2 likely involved the external\nmagnetic reconnection between the bottom of the overlying stretching field\nlines and the rebounding loops that were previously pushed by the eruption of\nFR1, which was evidenced by a pair of groups of newly-formed loops. All results\nsuggest that the compound eruptions involved both internal and external\nmagnetic reconnections, and two erupting structures of twin FRs interacted at\nthe initial stage. We propose that two episodes of internal magnetic\nreconnections were likely united within a few minutes to form the continuous\nimpulsive phase of the single peaked flare, and two separated cores of the CME\nwas possibly because that the latter core was too slow to merge with the former\none.",

      "title": "Bridging Action Frames: Instagram Infographics in U.S.Ethnic Movements",
      "abstract": "Instagram infographics are a digital activism tool that have redefined action\nframes for technology-facilitated social movements. From the 1960s through the\n1980s, United States ethnic movements practiced collective action:\nideologically unified, resource-intensive traditional activism. Today,\ntechnologically enabled movements have been categorized as practicing\nconnective action: individualized, low-resource online activism. Yet, we argue\nthat Instagram infographics are both connective and collective. This paper\njuxtaposes the insights of past and present U.S. ethnic movement activists and\nanalyzes Black Lives Matter Instagram data over the course of 7 years\n(2014-2020). We find that Instagram infographic activism bridges connective and\ncollective action in three ways: (1) Scope for Education: Visually enticing and\ndigestible infographics reduce the friction of information dissemination,\nfacilitating collective movement education while preserving customizability.\n(2) Reconciliation for Credibility: Activists use connective features to combat\ninfographic misinformation and resolve internal differences, creating a trusted\ncollective movement front. (3) High-Resource Efforts for Transformative Change:\nInstagram infographic activism has been paired with boots on the ground and\naction-oriented content, curating a connective-to-collective pipeline that\nexpends movement resources. Our work unveils the vitality of evaluating digital\nactivism action frames at the movement integration level, exemplifies the\npowerful coexistence of connective and collective action, and offers meaningful\ndesign implications for activists seeking to leverage this novel tool.",

      "abstract": "Edge computing technology has great potential to improve various\ncomputation-intensive applications in vehicular networks by providing\nsufficient computation resources for vehicles. However, it is still a challenge\nto fully unleash the potential of edge computing in edge computing-enabled\nvehicular networks. In this paper, we develop the energy-efficient cooperative\noffloading scheme for edge computing-enabled vehicular networks, which splits\nthe task into multiple subtasks and offloads them to different roadside units\n(RSUs) located ahead along the route of the vehicle. We first establish novel\ncooperative offloading models for the offline and online scenarios in edge\ncomputing-enabled vehicular networks. In each offloading scenario, we formulate\nthe total energy minimization with respect to the task splitting ratio,\ncomputation resource, and communication resource. In the offline scenario, we\nequivalently transform the original problem to a convex problem and obtain\noptimal solutions for multi-vehicle case and single-vehicle case, respectively.\nFurthermore, we show that the method proposed for the offline scenario can also\nbe applied to solve the optimization problem in the online scenario. Finally,\nthrough numerical results, by analyzing the impact of network parameters on the\ntotal energy consumption, we verify that our proposed solution consumes lower\nenergy than baseline schemes.",

      "abstract": "The discovery of massive galaxies at high redshifts, especially the passive\nones, poses a big challenge for the current standard galaxy formation models.\nHere we use the semi-analytic galaxy formation model developed by Henriques et\nal. to explore the formation and evolution of massive galaxies (MGs,\nstellar-mass $M_{*}> 10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$). Different from previous works, we\nfocus on the ones just formed (e.g. just reach $\\simeq 10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$).\nWe find that most of the MGs are formed around $z=0.6$, with the earliest\nformation at $z>4$. Interestingly, although most of the MGs in the local\nUniverse are passive, we find that only $13\\%$ of the MGs are quenched at the\nformation time. Most of the quenched MGs at formation already hosts a very\nmassive supermassive black hole (SMBH) which could power the very effective AGN\nfeedback. For the star-forming MGs, the ones with more massive SMBH prefer to\nquench in shorter timescales; in particular, those with $M_{\\textrm{SMBH}} >\n10^{7.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ have a quenching timescale of $\\sim 0.5$ Gyr and the\ncharacteristic $M_{\\textrm{SMBH}}$ depends on the chosen stellar mass threshold\nin the definition of MGs as a result of their co-evolution. We also find that\nthe \"in-situ\" star formation dominates the stellar mass growth of MGs until\nthey are formed. Over the whole redshift range, we find the quiescent MGs\nprefer to stay in more massive dark matter halos, and have more massive SMBH\nand less cold gas masses. Our results provide a new angle on the whole life of\nthe growth of MGs in the Universe.",

To\nfacilitate the use of the SFOL pulse, it is best to use legacy DMEs that are\nalready deployed to transmit the SFOL pulse, rather than the current Gaussian\npulse, through software changes only. When attempting to transmit the SFOL\npulse in legacy DMEs, the greatest challenge is the pulse shape distortion\ncaused by the pulse-shaping circuits and power amplifiers in the transmission\nunit such that the original SFOL pulse shape is no longer preserved. This\nletter proposes an inverse-learning-based DME digital predistortion method and\npresents successfully transmitted SFOL pulses from a testbed based on a\ncommercial legacy DME that was designed to transmit Gaussian pulses.",

Despite its\nusefulness, the problem remains challenging due to the influences from noisy\nand outlier relative motions, and the difficulty to model analytically and\nsuppress them with high fidelity. In this work, we avoid handcrafting robust\nloss functions, and propose to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn\ntransformation synchronization. Unlike previous works which use complicated\nmulti-stage pipelines, we use an iterative approach where each step consists of\na single weight-shared message passing layer that refines the absolute poses\nfrom the previous iteration by predicting an incremental update in the tangent\nspace. To reduce the influence of outliers, the messages are weighted before\naggregation. Our iterative approach alleviates the need for an explicit\ninitialization step and performs well with identity initial poses. Although our\napproach is simple, we show that it performs favorably against existing\nhandcrafted and learned synchronization methods through experiments on both\nSO(3) and SE(3) synchronization.",

      "abstract": "Online learning to rank (OL2R) has attracted great research interests in\nrecent years, thanks to its advantages in avoiding expensive relevance labeling\nas required in offline supervised ranking model learning. Such a solution\nexplores the unknowns (e.g., intentionally present selected results on top\npositions) to improve its relevance estimation. This however triggers concerns\non its ranking fairness: different groups of items might receive differential\ntreatments during the course of OL2R. But existing fair ranking solutions\nusually require the knowledge of result relevance or a performing ranker\nbeforehand, which contradicts with the setting of OL2R and thus cannot be\ndirectly applied to guarantee fairness.\n  In this work, we propose a general framework to achieve fairness defined by\ngroup exposure in OL2R. The key idea is to calibrate exploration and\nexploitation for fairness control, relevance learning and online ranking\nquality. In particular, when the model is exploring a set of results for\nrelevance feedback, we confine the exploration within a subset of random\npermutations, where fairness across groups is maintained while the feedback is\nstill unbiased. Theoretically we prove such a strategy introduces minimum\ndistortion in OL2R's regret to obtain fairness. Extensive empirical analysis is\nperformed on two public learning to rank benchmark datasets to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed solution compared to existing fair OL2R\nsolutions.",

In order to improve users'\nexperience, recommendation systems have been widely used in music\nrecommendations, movie recommendations, online shopping, and other scenarios.\nRecently, Knowledge Graph (KG) has been proven to be an effective tool to\nimprove the performance of recommendation systems. However, a huge challenge in\napplying knowledge graphs for recommendation is how to use knowledge graphs to\nobtain better user codes and item codes. In response to this problem, this\nresearch proposes a user Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder and item\nencoder recommendation algorithm based on Knowledge Graph (URIR). This study\nencodes items by capturing high-level neighbor information to generate items'\nrepresentation vectors and applies an RNN and items' representation vectors to\nencode users to generate users' representation vectors, and then perform inner\nproduct operation on users' representation vectors and items' representation\nvectors to get probabilities of users interaction with items. Numerical\nexperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that URIR is superior\nperformance to state-of-the-art algorithms in indicators such as AUC,\nPrecision, Recall, and MRR. This implies that URIR can effectively use\nknowledge graph to obtain better user codes and item codes, thereby obtaining\nbetter recommendation results.",

      "abstract": "Another year of the multimodal brain tumor segmentation challenge (BraTS)\n2021 provides an even larger dataset to facilitate collaboration and research\nof brain tumor segmentation methods, which are necessary for disease analysis\nand treatment planning. A large dataset size of BraTS 2021 and the advent of\nmodern GPUs provide a better opportunity for deep-learning based approaches to\nlearn tumor representation from the data. In this work, we maintained an\nencoder-decoder based segmentation network, but focused on a modification of\nnetwork training process that minimizes redundancy under perturbations. Given a\nset trained networks, we further introduce a confidence based ensembling\ntechniques to further improve the performance. We evaluated the method on BraTS\n2021 validation board, and achieved 0.8600, 0.8868 and 0.9265 average dice for\nenhanced tumor core, tumor core and whole tumor, respectively.

      "abstract": "The cooperative control of the connected and automated vehicle (CAV) is\nrecognized as an effective approach to alleviate traffic congestion and improve\ntraffic safety, especially for on-ramp bottlenecks. However, in the mixed\ntraffic, the uncertainty of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) makes the on-ramp\nmerging control for CAVs more challenging. This paper proposes a decentralized\noptimal control method to address the merging control problem of CAVs at\nhighway on-ramps in the mixed traffic. We first formulate the optimal merging\ncontrol problem, which includes the constraints of safety and vehicle dynamics,\nwith the objectives of minimizing travel time and energy consumption. Then, a\ncontrol framework, combining control barrier functions (CBFs) and control\nLyapunov functions (CLFs) is proposed. CBFs render the system subject to\nsafety-critical constraints, while CLFs stabilize the system to the objectives.\nIn addition, to enable effective control of CAVs in the mixed traffic, a\nrecursive merging control framework is proposed, where HDVs are regarded as\ndisturbances, and CAVs collect surrounding vehicles' states repeatedly and\nupdate their trajectories recursively to satisfy strict merging requirements.\nFinally, the merging problem is reformulated as a quadratic programming\nproblem, which allows for real-time application. Simulation results show that\nthe proposed on-ramp merging control method is robust in resisting disturbance\nfrom the HDV with traffic efficiency and energy economy improvement.",

We first employ a bias rectify module to alleviate the adverse\nimpact caused by the intra-class variations. bias rectify module is able to\nfocus on the features that are more discriminative for classification by given\ndifferent weights.

MetroLoc is built atop an IMU-centric state\nestimator that tightly couples light detection and ranging (LiDAR), visual, and\ninertial information with the convenience of loosely coupled methods. The\nproposed framework is composed of three submodules: IMU odometry,\nLiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO), and Visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The IMU is\ntreated as the primary sensor, which achieves the observations from LIO and VIO\nto constrain the accelerometer and gyroscope biases. Compared to previous\npoint-only LIO methods, our approach leverages more geometry information by\nintroducing both line and plane features into motion estimation. The VIO also\nutilizes the environmental structure information by employing both lines and\npoints. Our proposed method has been extensively tested in the long-during\nmetro environments with a maintenance vehicle. Experimental results show the\nsystem more accurate and robust than the state-of-the-art approaches with\nreal-time performance.

      "abstract": "3D interacting hand reconstruction is essential to facilitate human-machine\ninteraction and human behaviors understanding. Previous works in this field\neither rely on auxiliary inputs such as depth images or they can only handle a\nsingle hand if monocular single RGB images are used. Single-hand methods tend\nto generate collided hand meshes, when applied to closely interacting hands,\nsince they cannot model the interactions between two hands explicitly. In this\npaper, we make the first attempt to reconstruct 3D interacting hands from\nmonocular single RGB images. Our method can generate 3D hand meshes with both\nprecise 3D poses and minimal collisions. This is made possible via a two-stage\nframework. Specifically, the first stage adopts a convolutional neural network\nto generate coarse predictions that tolerate collisions but encourage\npose-accurate hand meshes. The second stage progressively ameliorates the\ncollisions through a series of factorized refinements while retaining the\npreciseness of 3D poses. We carefully investigate potential implementations for\nthe factorized refinement, considering the trade-off between efficiency and\naccuracy. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results on large-scale\ndatasets such as InterHand2.6M demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach.",

      "abstract": "Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are relevant sources of radiation that might\nhave helped reionising the Universe during its early epochs. The super-massive\nblack holes (SMBHs) they host helped accreting material and emitting large\namounts of energy into the medium. Recent studies have shown that, for epochs\nearlier than $z~{\\sim}~5$, the number density of SMBHs is on the order of few\nhundreds per square degree. Latest observations place this value below $300$\nSMBHs at $z~{\\gtrsim}~6$ for the full sky. To overcome this gap, it is\nnecessary to detect large numbers of sources at the earliest epochs. Given the\nlarge areas needed to detect such quantities, using traditional redshift\ndetermination techniques -- spectroscopic and photometric redshift -- is no\nlonger an efficient task. Machine Learning (ML) might help obtaining precise\nredshift for large samples in a fraction of the time used by other methods. We\nhave developed and implemented an ML model which can predict redshift values\nfor WISE-detected AGN in the HETDEX Spring Field. We obtained a median\nprediction error of $\\sigma_{z}^{N} = 1.48 \\times (z_{\\mathrm{Predicted}} -\nz_{{\\mathrm{True}}}) / (1 + z_{\\mathrm{True}}) = 0.1162$ and an outlier\nfraction of $\\eta = 11.58 \\%$ at $(z_{\\mathrm{Predicted}} -\nz_{{\\mathrm{True}}}) / (1 + z_{\\mathrm{True}}) > 0.15$, in line with previous\napplications of ML to AGN. We also applied the model to data from the Stripe 82\narea obtaining a prediction error of $\\sigma_{z}^{N} = 0.2501$.",

      "abstract": "In the current era of digitization, online payment systems are attracting\nconsiderable interest. Improving the efficiency of a payment system is\nimportant since it has a substantial impact on revenues for businesses. A\ngateway is an integral component of a payment system through which every\ntransaction is routed. In an online payment system, payment processors\nintegrate with these gateways by means of various configurations such as\npricing, methods, risk checks, etc. These configurations are called terminals.\nEach gateway can have multiple terminals associated with it. Routing a payment\ntransaction through the best terminal is crucial to increase the probability of\na payment transaction being successful. Machine learning (ML) and artificial\nintelligence (AI) techniques can be used to accurately predict the best\nterminals based on their previous performance and various payment-related\nattributes. We have devised a pipeline consisting of static and dynamic\nmodules. The static module does the initial filtering of the terminals using\nstatic rules and a logistic regression model that predicts gateway downtimes.\nSubsequently, the dynamic module computes a lot of novel features based on\nsuccess rate, payment attributes, time lag, etc. to model the terminal\nbehaviour accurately. These features are updated using an adaptive time decay\nrate algorithm in real-time using a feedback loop and passed to a random forest\nclassifier to predict the success probabilities for every terminal. This\npipeline is currently in production at Razorpay routing millions of\ntransactions through it in real-time and has given a 4-6\\% improvement in\nsuccess rate across all payment methods (credit card, debit card, UPI, net\nbanking). This has made our payment system more resilient to performance drops,\nwhich has improved the user experience, instilled more trust in the merchants,\nand boosted the revenue of the business.",

      "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) methods have seen widespread adoption in seismology in\nrecent years. The ability of these techniques to efficiently infer the\nstatistical properties of large datasets often provides significant\nimprovements over traditional techniques. With the entire spectrum of\nseismological tasks, e.g., seismic picking, source property estimation, ground\nmotion prediction, hypocentre determination; among others, now incorporating ML\napproaches, numerous models are emerging as these techniques are further\nadopted within seismology. To evaluate these algorithms, quality controlled\nbenchmark datasets that contain representative class distributions are vital.\nIn addition to this, models require implementation through a common framework\nto facilitate comparison. Accessing these various benchmark datasets for\ntraining and implementing the standardization of models is currently a\ntime-consuming process, hindering further advancement of ML techniques within\nseismology. These development bottlenecks also affect \"practitioners\" seeking\nto deploy the latest models on seismic data, without having to necessarily\nlearn entirely new ML frameworks to perform this task. We present SeisBench as\na software package to tackle these issues. SeisBench is an open-source\nframework for deploying ML in seismology. SeisBench standardises access to both\nmodels and datasets, whilst also providing a range of common processing and\ndata augmentation operations through the API. Through SeisBench, users can\naccess several seismological ML models and benchmark datasets available in the\nliterature via a single interface. SeisBench is built to be extensible, with\ncommunity involvement encouraged to expand the package. Having such frameworks\navailable for accessing leading ML models forms an essential tool for\nseismologists seeking to iterate and apply the next generation of ML techniques\nto seismic data.",

To get rid of the dilemma, in this work, we borrow ideas\nfrom knowledge graph (KG), and propose a knowledge-driven model for site\nselection, short for KnowSite. Specifically, motivated by distilled knowledge\nand rich semantics in KG, we firstly construct an urban KG (UrbanKG) with\ncities' key elements and semantic relationships captured. Based on UrbanKG, we\nemploy pre-training techniques for semantic representations, which are fed into\nan encoder-decoder structure for site decisions. With multi-relational message\npassing and relation path-based attention mechanism developed, KnowSite\nsuccessfully reveals the relationship between various businesses and site\nselection criteria. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that\nKnowSite outperforms representative baselines with both effectiveness and\nexplainability achieved.",

Recent\nresearch in pedestrian tracking has shown that motion can be inferred from\ninertial data using convolutional neural networks. A learned inertial\ndisplacement measurement can improve state estimation in challenging scenarios\nwhere leg odometry is unreliable, such as slipping and compressible terrains.\nOur work learns to estimate a displacement measurement from IMU data which is\nthen fused with traditional leg odometry. Our approach greatly reduces the\ndrift of proprioceptive state estimation, which is critical for legged robots\ndeployed in vision and lidar denied environments such as foggy sewers or dusty\nmines. We compared results from an EKF and an incremental fixed-lag factor\ngraph estimator using data from several real robot experiments crossing\nchallenging terrains. Our results show a reduction of relative pose error by\n37% in challenging scenarios when compared to a traditional kinematic-inertial\nestimator without learned measurement. We also demonstrate a 22% reduction in\nerror when used with vision systems in visually degraded environments such as\nan underground mine.",

The curved paths originate from a basic mechanical\nmodel (a compressed plate model), which is used to mimic the motion of the chip\non the rake face of the tool without performing real cutting simulations.\nConsequently, actual cutting forces are predicted using orthogonal cutting data\nand the orthogonal-to-oblique transformations.

      "abstract": "A recurrent question in climate risk analysis is determining how climate\nchange will affect heavy precipitation patterns. Dividing the globe into\nhomogeneous sub-regions should improve the modelling of heavy precipitation by\ninferring common regional distributional parameters. In addition, in the\ndetection and attribution (D&A) field, biases due to model errors in global\nclimate models (GCMs) should be considered to attribute the anthropogenic\nforcing effect. Within this D&A context, we propose an efficient clustering\nalgorithm that, compared to classical regional frequency analysis (RFA)\ntechniques, is covariate-free and accounts for dependence. It is based on a new\nnon-parametric dissimilarity that combines both the RFA constraint and the\npairwise dependence. We derive asymptotic properties of our dissimilarity\nestimator, and we interpret it for generalised extreme value distributed pairs.\n  As a D&A application, we cluster annual daily precipitation maxima of 16 GCMs\nfrom the coupled model intercomparison project. We combine the climatologically\nconsistent subregions identified for all GCMs. This improves the spatial\nclusters coherence and outperforms methods either based on margins or on\ndependence. Finally, by comparing the natural forcings partition with the one\nwith all forcings, we assess the impact of anthropogenic forcing on\nprecipitation extreme patterns.",

Apart from economic\ngains, this would reduce the amount of antibiotics used in livestock farming\nwhich otherwise enters the human diet exasperating the epidemic of antibiotic\nresistance - a leading cause of death. We could use standard video cameras,\navailable in most modern farms, to monitor livestock. However, most computer\nvision algorithms perform poorly on this task, primarily because, (i) animals\nbred in farms look identical, lacking any obvious spatial signature, (ii) none\nof the existing trackers are robust for long duration, and (iii) real-world\nconditions such as changing illumination, frequent occlusion, varying camera\nangles, and sizes of the animals make it hard for models to generalize.

      "abstract": "In a protocluster USS1558-003 at z=2.53, galaxies in the dense cores show\nsystematically elevated star-forming activities than those in less dense\nregions. To understand its origin, we look into the gas properties of the\ngalaxies in the dense cores by conducting deep 1.1mm observations with Atacama\nLarge Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We detect interstellar dust\ncontinuum emissions from 12 member galaxies and estimate their molecular gas\nmasses. Comparing these gas masses with our previous measurements from CO(3-2)\nline, we infer that the latter might be overestimated. We find that the gas to\nstellar mass ratios of the galaxies in the dense cores tend to be higher (at M*\n~ 10^{10} M_sun) where we see the enhanced star-forming activities), suggesting\nthat such large gas masses can sustain their high star-forming activities.\nHowever, if we compare the gas properties of these protocluster galaxies with\nthe gas scaling relations constructed for field galaxies at similar cosmic\nepoch, we find no significant environmental difference at the same stellar mass\nand star formation rate. Although both gas mass ratios and star-forming\nactivities are enhanced in the majority of member galaxies, they appear to\nfollow the same scaling relation as field galaxies. Our results are consistent\nwith the scenario that the cold gas is efficiently supplied to protocluster\ncores and to galaxies therein along surrounding filamentary structures, which\nleads to the high gas mass fractions and thus the elevated star-formation\nactivities, but without changing the star formation law.",

The tests\nprovide a strict control for Type I errors and high statistical power, even for\nnon-normally and non-linearly dependent predictions, often seen in machine\nlearning. Applying the proposed tests on models trained on functional brain\nconnectivity data from the Human Connectome Project and the Autism Brain\nImaging Data Exchange dataset reveals confounders that were previously\nunreported or found to be hard to correct for with state-of-the-art confound\nmitigation approaches.

A diffraction grating is hence introduced in the\nreference arm of the interferometer, allowing the coherence plane of the\nreference beam to be tilted following angular dispersion. The phase planes of\nthe reference beam and the object beam appears to be coplanar. The principle\nand performance of low-coherence off-axis digital holographic microscopy are\ndemonstrated.

However,\nEssence is a rich language in which there are many equivalent ways to specify a\ngiven problem. A user may therefore omit the use of domain attributes or\nabstract types, resulting in fewer refinement rules being applicable and\ntherefore a reduced set of output models from which to select. This paper\naddresses the problem of recovering this information automatically to increase\nthe robustness of the quality of the output constraint models in the face of\nvariation in the input Essence specification. We present reformulation rules\nthat can change the type of a decision variable or add attributes that shrink\nits domain.

      "abstract": "Modelling various spatio-temporal dependencies is the key to recognising\nhuman actions in skeleton sequences. Most existing methods excessively relied\non the design of traversal rules or graph topologies to draw the dependencies\nof the dynamic joints, which is inadequate to reflect the relationships of the\ndistant yet important joints. Furthermore, due to the locally adopted\noperations, the important long-range temporal information is therefore not well\nexplored in existing works. To address this issue, in this work we propose\nLSTA-Net: a novel Long short-term Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network, which\ncan effectively capture the long/short-range dependencies in a spatio-temporal\nmanner. We devise our model into a pure factorised architecture which can\nalternately perform spatial feature aggregation and temporal feature\naggregation. To improve the feature aggregation effect, a channel-wise\nattention mechanism is also designed and employed. Extensive experiments were\nconducted on three public benchmark datasets, and the results suggest that our\napproach can capture both long-and-short range dependencies in the space and\ntime domain, yielding higher results than other state-of-the-art methods.

We present here our approach of ``living literature reviews''\nwhere the core information is represented as Linked Data which can be amended\nwith new findings after the publication of the literature review. We present a\nprototype implementation, which we use for a case study where we expose\npotential users to a concrete literature review modeled with our approach. We\nobserve that our model is technically feasible and is received well by\nresearchers, with our ``living'' versions scoring higher than their traditional\ncounterparts in our user study. In conclusion, we find that there are strong\nbenefits to using a Linked Data solution to extend the effective lifetime of a\nliterature review.",

      "abstract": "There has been a large focus in recent years on making assets in scientific\nresearch findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, collectively known\nas the FAIR principles. A particular area of focus lies in applying these\nprinciples to scientific computational workflows. Jupyter notebooks are a very\npopular medium by which to program and communicate computational scientific\nanalyses. However, they present unique challenges when it comes to reuse of\nonly particular steps of an analysis without disrupting the usual flow and\nbenefits of the notebook approach, making it difficult to fully comply with the\nFAIR principles. Here we present an approach and toolset for adding the power\nof semantic technologies to Python-encoded scientific workflows in a simple,\nautomated and minimally intrusive manner. The semantic descriptions are\npublished as a series of nanopublications that can be searched and used in\nother notebooks by means of a Jupyter Lab plugin. We describe the\nimplementation of the proposed approach and toolset, and provide the results of\na user study with 15 participants, designed around image processing workflows,\nto evaluate the usability of the system and its perceived effect on FAIRness.\nOur results show that our approach is feasible and perceived as user-friendly.\nOur system received an overall score of 78.75 on the System Usability Scale,\nwhich is above the average score reported in the literature.",

We report a proof-of-principle\nresult on Mn in the role of tuning vacancy diffusion by an anomalous Friedel\nOscillations effect in an equivalent NiCoFeCrMn high entropy alloy. The vacancy\ninduced Friedel Oscillations is destroyed by the presence of the first nearest\nneighboring Mn, opening a channel for long-range influence on the surrounding\natoms from the vacancy, resulting in a lower vacancy diffusion barrier energy,\ndespite of the atom type. The effects lead to a remarkable diffusion overlaps\nof the two type defects, vacancy and interstitial, enhancing their\nrecombination, which can explain well for the experimental results with\nsuppression of vacancy clusters under irradiation. This finding presents new\nunderstanding on the atomic diffusion mechanism and thus suggests novel\nconcepts for tuning defect properties in the design of advanced materials with\noutstanding properties, in a broad field.",

      "abstract": "Shared autonomy provides a framework where a human and an automated system,\nsuch as a robot, jointly control the system's behavior, enabling an effective\nsolution for various applications, including human-robot interaction. However,\na challenging problem in shared autonomy is safety because the human input may\nbe unknown and unpredictable, which affects the robot's safety constraints. If\nthe human input is a force applied through physical contact with the robot, it\nalso alters the robot's behavior to maintain safety. We address the safety\nissue of shared autonomy in real-time applications by proposing a two-layer\ncontrol framework. In the first layer, we use the history of human input\nmeasurements to infer what the human wants the robot to do and define the\nrobot's safety constraints according to that inference. In the second layer, we\nformulate a rapidly-exploring random tree of barrier pairs, with each barrier\npair composed of a barrier function and a controller. Using the controllers in\nthese barrier pairs, the robot is able to maintain its safe operation under the\nintervention from the human input. This proposed control framework allows the\nrobot to assist the human while preventing them from encountering safety\nissues. We demonstrate the proposed control framework on a simulation of a\ntwo-linkage manipulator robot.",

Existing methods utilizing flow-based warping for non-rigid\nhuman image generation have achieved great success.

To this end,\nwe propose the Flow-based Dual Attention GAN (FDA-GAN) to apply occlusion- and\ndeformation-aware feature fusion for higher generation quality. Specifically,\ndeformable local attention and flow similarity attention, constituting the dual\nattention mechanism, can derive the output features responsible for deformable-\nand occlusion-aware fusion, respectively. Besides, to maintain the pose and\nglobal position consistency in transferring, we design a pose normalization\nnetwork for learning adaptive normalization from the target pose to the source\nperson.

      "abstract": "This paper challenges the cross-domain semantic segmentation task, aiming to\nimprove the segmentation accuracy on the unlabeled target domain without\nincurring additional annotation. Using the pseudo-label-based unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA) pipeline, we propose a novel and effective Multiple\nFusion Adaptation (MFA) method. MFA basically considers three parallel\ninformation fusion strategies, i.e., the cross-model fusion, temporal fusion\nand a novel online-offline pseudo label fusion. Specifically, the\nonline-offline pseudo label fusion encourages the adaptive training to pay\nadditional attention to difficult regions that are easily ignored by offline\npseudo labels, therefore retaining more informative details. While the other\ntwo fusion strategies may look standard, MFA pays significant efforts to raise\nthe efficiency and effectiveness for integration, and succeeds in injecting all\nthe three strategies into a unified framework. Experiments on two widely used\nbenchmarks, i.e., GTA5-to-Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes, show that our\nmethod significantly improves the semantic segmentation adaptation, and sets up\nnew state of the art (58.2% and 62.5% mIoU, respectively).

For that\npurpose, we show that any knot is a Murasugi sum of any two knots, and we give\nlower and upper bounds for the minimal complexity of Murasugi sum to obtain\n$K_3$ by $K_1$ and $K_2$. As an application, we show that given any three\nknots, there is a braid for one knot which splits along a string into braids\nfor the other two knots.",

      "title": "Exploring Social Posterior Collapse in Variational Autoencoder for\n  Interaction Modeling",
      "abstract": "Multi-agent behavior modeling and trajectory forecasting are crucial for the\nsafe navigation of autonomous agents in interactive scenarios. Variational\nAutoencoder (VAE) has been widely applied in multi-agent interaction modeling\nto generate diverse behavior and learn a low-dimensional representation for\ninteracting systems. However, existing literature did not formally discuss if a\nVAE-based model can properly encode interaction into its latent space. In this\nwork, we argue that one of the typical formulations of VAEs in multi-agent\nmodeling suffers from an issue we refer to as social posterior collapse, i.e.,\nthe model is prone to ignoring historical social context when predicting the\nfuture trajectory of an agent. It could cause significant prediction errors and\npoor generalization performance. We analyze the reason behind this\nunder-explored phenomenon and propose several measures to tackle it. Afterward,\nwe implement the proposed framework and experiment on real-world datasets for\nmulti-agent trajectory prediction. In particular, we propose a novel sparse\ngraph attention message-passing (sparse-GAMP) layer, which helps us detect\nsocial posterior collapse in our experiments. In the experiments, we verify\nthat social posterior collapse indeed occurs. Also, the proposed measures are\neffective in alleviating the issue. As a result, the model attains better\ngeneralization performance when historical social context is informative for\nprediction.",

      "abstract": "Temporal action localization has long been researched in computer vision.\nExisting state-of-the-art action localization methods divide each video into\nmultiple action units (i.e., proposals in two-stage methods and segments in\none-stage methods) and then perform action recognition/regression on each of\nthem individually, without explicitly exploiting their relations during\nlearning. In this paper, we claim that the relations between action units play\nan important role in action localization, and a more powerful action detector\nshould not only capture the local content of each action unit but also allow a\nwider field of view on the context related to it. To this end, we propose a\ngeneral graph convolutional module (GCM) that can be easily plugged into\nexisting action localization methods, including two-stage and one-stage\nparadigms. To be specific, we first construct a graph, where each action unit\nis represented as a node and their relations between two action units as an\nedge. Here, we use two types of relations, one for capturing the temporal\nconnections between different action units, and the other one for\ncharacterizing their semantic relationship. Particularly for the temporal\nconnections in two-stage methods, we further explore two different kinds of\nedges, one connecting the overlapping action units and the other one connecting\nsurrounding but disjointed units. Upon the graph we built, we then apply graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs) to model the relations among different action\nunits, which is able to learn more informative representations to enhance\naction localization. Experimental results show that our GCM consistently\nimproves the performance of existing action localization methods, including\ntwo-stage methods (e.g., CBR and R-C3D) and one-stage methods (e.g., D-SSAD),\nverifying the generality and effectiveness of our GCM.",

      "abstract": "The commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) component based ecosystem provides an\nattractive system design paradigm due to the drastic reduction in development\ntime and cost compared to custom solutions. However, it brings in a growing\nconcern of trustworthiness arising from the possibility of embedded malicious\nlogic, or hardware Trojans in COTS components. Existing trust-verification\napproaches are typically not applicable to COTS hardware due to the absence of\ngolden models and the lack of observability of internal signals. In this work,\nwe propose a novel approach for runtime Trojan detection and resilience in\nuntrusted COTS processors through judicious modifications in software. The\nproposed approach does not rely on any hardware redundancy or architectural\nmodification and hence seamlessly integrates with the COTS-based system design\nprocess. Trojan resilience is achieved through the execution of multiple\nfunctionally equivalent software variants. We have developed and implemented a\nsolution for compiler-based automatic generation of program variants,\nmetric-guided selection of variants, and their integration in a single\nexecutable. To evaluate the proposed approach, we first analyzed the\neffectiveness of program variants in avoiding the activation of a random pool\nof Trojans. By implementing several Trojans in an OpenRISC 1000 processor, we\nanalyzed the detectability and resilience during Trojan activation in both\nsingle and multiple variants. We also present delay and code size overhead for\nthe automatically generated variants for several programs and discuss future\nresearch directions to reduce the overhead.",

Recently, important real-world applications, such as medical diagnosis\nand cybersecurity, have generated renewed interest in the Neyman-Pearson (NP)\nclassification paradigm, which constrains the more severe type of error (e.g.,\nthe type I error) under a preferred level while minimizing the other (e.g., the\ntype II error). However, there has been little research on the NP paradigm\nunder label noise. It is somewhat surprising that even when common NP\nclassifiers ignore the label noise in the training stage, they are still able\nto control the type I error with high probability. However, the price they pay\nis excessive conservativeness of the type I error and hence a significant drop\nin power (i.e., $1 - $ type II error). Assuming that domain experts provide\nlower bounds on the corruption severity, we propose the first theory-backed\nalgorithm that adapts most state-of-the-art classification methods to the\ntraining label noise under the NP paradigm. The resulting classifiers not only\ncontrol the type I error with high probability under the desired level but also\nimprove power.",

      "abstract": "Existing person re-identification (ReID) methods typically directly load the\npre-trained ImageNet weights for initialization. However, as a fine-grained\nclassification task, ReID is more challenging and exists a large domain gap\nbetween ImageNet classification. Inspired by the great success of\nself-supervised representation learning with contrastive objectives, in this\npaper, we design an Unsupervised Pre-training framework for ReID based on the\ncontrastive learning (CL) pipeline, dubbed UP-ReID. During the pre-training, we\nattempt to address two critical issues for learning fine-grained ReID features:\n(1) the augmentations in CL pipeline may distort the discriminative clues in\nperson images. (2) the fine-grained local features of person images are not\nfully-explored. Therefore, we introduce an intra-identity\n(I$^2$-)regularization in the UP-ReID, which is instantiated as two constraints\ncoming from global image aspect and local patch aspect: a global consistency is\nenforced between augmented and original person images to increase robustness to\naugmentation, while an intrinsic contrastive constraint among local patches of\neach image is employed to fully explore the local discriminative clues.\nExtensive experiments on multiple popular Re-ID datasets, including PersonX,\nMarket1501, CUHK03, and MSMT17, demonstrate that our UP-ReID pre-trained model\ncan significantly benefit the downstream ReID fine-tuning and achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance.

      "abstract": "We consider an online allocation problem that involves a set $P$ of $n$\nplayers and a set $E$ of $m$ indivisible entities over discrete time steps\n$1,2,\\ldots,\\tau$. At each time step $t \\in [1,\\tau]$, for every entity $e \\in\nE$, there is a restriction list $L_t(e)$ that prescribes the subset of players\nto whom $e$ can be assigned and a non-negative value $v_t(e,p)$ of $e$ to every\nplayer $p \\in P$. The sets $P$ and $E$ are fixed beforehand. The sets\n$L_t(\\cdot)$ and values $v_t(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ are given in an online fashion. An\nallocation is a distribution of $E$ among $P$, and we are interested in the\nminimum total value of the entities received by a player according to the\nallocation. In the static case, it is NP-hard to find an optimal allocation the\nmaximizes this minimum value. On the other hand, $\\rho$-approximation\nalgorithms have been developed for certain values of $\\rho \\in (0,1]$. We\npropose a $w$-lookahead algorithm for the multistage online maxmin allocation\nproblem for any fixed $w \\geq 1$ in which the restriction lists and values of\nentities may change between time steps, and there is a fixed stability reward\nfor an entity to be assigned to the same player from one time step to the next.\nThe objective is to maximize the sum of the minimum values and stability\nrewards over the time steps $1, 2, \\ldots, \\tau$. Our algorithm achieves a\ncompetitive ratio of $(1-c)\\rho$, where $c$ is the positive root of the\nequation $wc^2 = \\rho (w+1)(1-c)$. When $w = 1$, it is greater than\n$\\frac{\\rho}{4\\rho+2} + \\frac{\\rho}{10}$, which improves upon the previous\nratio of $\\frac{\\rho}{4\\rho+2 - 2^{1-\\tau}(2\\rho+1)}$ obtained for the case of\n1-lookahead.",

      "abstract": "In response to the threat of adversarial examples, adversarial training\nprovides an attractive option for enhancing the model robustness by training\nmodels on online-augmented adversarial examples. However, most of the existing\nadversarial training methods focus on improving the robust accuracy by\nstrengthening the adversarial examples but neglecting the increasing shift\nbetween natural data and adversarial examples, leading to a dramatic decrease\nin natural accuracy. To maintain the trade-off between natural and robust\naccuracy, we alleviate the shift from the perspective of feature adaption and\npropose a Feature Adaptive Adversarial Training (FAAT) optimizing the\nclass-conditional feature adaption across natural data and adversarial\nexamples. Specifically, we propose to incorporate a class-conditional\ndiscriminator to encourage the features become (1) class-discriminative and (2)\ninvariant to the change of adversarial attacks. The novel FAAT framework\nenables the trade-off between natural and robust accuracy by generating\nfeatures with similar distribution across natural and adversarial data, and\nachieve higher overall robustness benefited from the class-discriminative\nfeature characteristics. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that FAAT\nproduces more discriminative features and performs favorably against\nstate-of-the-art methods.

However, emerging\nmemory technology is intrinsically unstable, resulting in random fluctuations\nof data reads. This can translate to non-negligible accuracy loss, potentially\nnullifying the gains.

We thus obtain a multi-scale quantity\nthat is not restricted to the first two moments of the density distribution,\nnor to the covariance, but that probes the complete dependences in the process.\nThis index indeed provides a measure of the regularity of the process at a\ngiven scale.Not only is this index able to indicate whether a realization of\nthe process is stationary, but its evolution across scales also indicates how\nrough and non-stationary it is.We show how the index behaves for various\nsynthetic processes proposed to model fluid turbulence, as well as on\nexperimental fluid turbulence measurements.",

      "abstract": "Developing an accurate tourism forecasting model is essential for making\ndesirable policy decisions for tourism management. Early studies on tourism\nmanagement focus on discovering external factors related to tourism demand.\nRecent studies utilize deep learning in demand forecasting along with these\nexternal factors. They mainly use recursive neural network models such as LSTM\nand RNN for their frameworks. However, these models are not suitable for use in\nforecasting tourism demand. This is because tourism demand is strongly affected\nby changes in various external factors, and recursive neural network models\nhave limitations in handling these multivariate inputs. We propose a multi-head\nattention CNN model (MHAC) for addressing these limitations. The MHAC uses\n1D-convolutional neural network to analyze temporal patterns and the attention\nmechanism to reflect correlations between input variables. This model makes it\npossible to extract spatiotemporal characteristics from time-series data of\nvarious variables. We apply our forecasting framework to predict inbound\ntourist changes in South Korea by considering external factors such as\npolitics, disease, season, and attraction of Korean culture. The performance\nresults of extensive experiments show that our method outperforms other\ndeep-learning-based prediction frameworks in South Korea tourism forecasting.",

      "abstract": "Although the performance of 3D human pose and shape estimation methods has\nimproved significantly in recent years, existing approaches typically generate\n3D poses defined in camera or human-centered coordinate system. This makes it\ndifficult to estimate a person's pure pose and motion in world coordinate\nsystem for a video captured using a moving camera. To address this issue, this\npaper presents a camera motion agnostic approach for predicting 3D human pose\nand mesh defined in the world coordinate system. The core idea of the proposed\napproach is to estimate the difference between two adjacent global poses (i.e.,\nglobal motion) that is invariant to selecting the coordinate system, instead of\nthe global pose coupled to the camera motion. To this end, we propose a network\nbased on bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs) that predicts the global\nmotion sequence from the local pose sequence consisting of relative rotations\nof joints called global motion regressor (GMR). We use 3DPW and synthetic\ndatasets, which are constructed in a moving-camera environment, for evaluation.\nWe conduct extensive experiments and prove the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod empirically.

In order to study the influence of twin boundaries on\nthe crack growth behaviour, single and multiple twin boundaries were introduced\nperpendicular to crack growth direction. The results indicate that the\n(111)$<$110$>$ crack in single crystal BCC Fe grows in brittle manner.

Further, increasing the number of twin\nboundaries increased the amount of plastic deformation leading to better crack\nresistance and high failure strains.

Thus far,\nsequence models have yielded fruitful results with note-level (MIDI-equivalent)\nsymbolic representations of music. Although the note-level representations can\ncomprise sufficient information to reproduce music aurally, they cannot contain\nadequate information to represent music visually in terms of notation. Musical\nscores contain various musical symbols (e.g., clef, key signature, and notes)\nand attributes (e.g., stem direction, beam, and tie) that enable us to visually\ncomprehend musical content. However, automated estimation of these elements has\nyet to be comprehensively addressed. In this paper, we first design score token\nrepresentation corresponding to the various musical elements. We then train the\nTransformer model to transcribe note-level representation into appropriate\nmusic notation. Evaluations of popular piano scores show that the proposed\nmethod significantly outperforms existing methods on all 12 musical aspects\nthat were investigated.

This work is about compressing vectors over categorical\nattributes to low-dimension discrete vectors. The current hash-based methods\ncompressing vectors over categorical attributes to low-dimension discrete\nvectors do not provide any guarantee on the Hamming distances between the\ncompressed representations. Here we present FSketch to create sketches for\nsparse categorical data and an estimator to estimate the pairwise Hamming\ndistances among the uncompressed data only from their sketches. We claim that\nthese sketches can be used in the usual data mining tasks in place of the\noriginal data without compromising the quality of the task. For that, we ensure\nthat the sketches also are categorical, sparse, and the Hamming distance\nestimates are reasonably precise. Both the sketch construction and the Hamming\ndistance estimation algorithms require just a single-pass; furthermore, changes\nto a data point can be incorporated into its sketch in an efficient manner. The\ncompressibility depends upon how sparse the data is and is independent of the\noriginal dimension -- making our algorithm attractive for many real-life\nscenarios. Our claims are backed by rigorous theoretical analysis of the\nproperties of FSketch and supplemented by extensive comparative evaluations\nwith related algorithms on some real-world datasets. We show that FSketch is\nsignificantly faster, and the accuracy obtained by using its sketches are among\nthe top for the standard unsupervised tasks of RMSE, clustering and similarity\nsearch.",

      "abstract": "Precise measurement of flow velocity in microfluidic channels is of\nimportance in microfluidic applications, such as quantitative chemical\nanalysis, sample preparation and drug synthesis. However, simple approaches for\nquickly and precisely measuring the flow velocity in microchannels are still\nlacking. Herein, we propose a deep neural networks assisted scalar image\nvelocimetry (DNN-SIV) for quick and precise extraction of fluid velocity in a\nshallow microfluidic channel with a high aspect ratio, which is a basic\ngeometry for cell culture, from a dye concentration field with spatiotemporal\ngradients. DNN-SIV is built on physics-informed neural networks and residual\nneural networks that integrate data of scalar field and physics laws to\ndetermine the velocity in the height direction. The underlying enforcing\nphysics laws are derived from the Navier-Stokes equation and the scalar\ntransport equation. Apart from this, dynamic concentration boundary condition\nis adopted to improve the velocity measurement of laminar flow with small\nReynolds Number in microchannels. The proposed DNN-SIV is validated and\nanalyzed by numerical simulations. Compared to integral minimization algorithm\nused in conventional SIV, DNN-SIV is robust to noise in the measured scalar\nfield and more efficiently allowing real-time flow visualization. Furthermore,\nthe fundamental significance of rational construction of concentration field in\nmicrochannels is also underscored. The proposed DNN-SIV in this paper is\nagnostic to initial and boundary conditions that can be a promising velocity\nmeasurement approach for many potential applications in microfluidic chips.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computing is performed on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)\nhardware in the short term. Only small circuits can be executed reliably on a\nquantum machine due to the unavoidable noisy quantum operations on NISQ\ndevices, leading to the under-utilization of hardware resources. With the\ngrowing demand to access quantum hardware, how to utilize it more efficiently\nwhile maintaining output fidelity is becoming a timely issue. A parallel\ncircuit execution technique has been proposed to address this problem by\nexecuting multiple programs on hardware simultaneously. It can improve the\nhardware throughput and reduce the overall runtime. However, accumulative\nnoises such as crosstalk can decrease the output fidelity in parallel workload\nexecution. In this paper, we first give an in-depth overview of stateof-the-art\nparallel circuit execution methods. Second, we propose a Quantum\nCrosstalk-aware Parallel workload execution method (QuCP) without the overhead\nof crosstalk characterization. Third, we investigate the trade-off between\nhardware throughput and fidelity loss to explore the hardware limitation with\nparallel circuit execution. Finally, we apply parallel circuit execution to VQE\nand zero-noise extrapolation error mitigation method to showcase its various\napplications on advancing NISQ computing.",

Hence, we create a comprehensive comparison between the\nvarious machine learning models to predict the rate of success of a movie. The\neffectiveness of these models along with their statistical significance is\nstudied to conclude which of these models is the best predictor. Some insights\nregarding factors that affect the success of the movies are also found. The\nmodels studied include some Regression models, Machine Learning models, a Time\nSeries model and a Neural Network with the Neural Network being the best\nperforming model with an accuracy of about 86%.

      "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer events partition a gene tree $T$ and thus, its leaf\nset into subsets of genes whose evolutionary history is described by speciation\nand duplication events alone. Indirect phylogenetic methods can be used to\ninfer such partitions $\\mathcal{P}$ from sequence similarity or evolutionary\ndistances without any a priory knowledge about the underlying tree $T$. In this\ncontribution, we assume that such a partition $\\mathcal{P}$ of a set of genes\n$X$ is given and that, independently, an estimate $T$ of the original gene tree\non $X$ has been derived. We then ask to what extent $T$ and the xenology\ninformation, i.e., $\\mathcal{P}$ can be combined to determine the horizontal\ntransfer edges in $T$. We show that for each pair of genes $x$ and $y$ with\n$x,y$ being in different parts of $\\mathcal{P}$, it can be decided whether\nthere always exists or never exists a horizontal gene transfer in $T$ along the\npath connecting $y$ and the most recent common ancestor of $x$ and $y$. This\nproblem is equivalent to determining the presence or absence of the directed\nedge $(x,y)$ in so-called Fitch graphs; a more fine-grained version of graphs\nthat represent the dependencies between the sets in $\\mathcal{P}$. We then\nconsider the generalization to insufficiently resolved gene trees and show that\nanalogous results can be obtained. We show that the classification of $(x,y)$\ncan be computed in constant time after linear-time preprocessing. Using\nsimulated gene family histories, we observe empirically that the vast majority\nof horizontal transfer edges in the gene tree $T$ can be recovered\nunambiguously.",

Spiral learning aims to learn\ngeneralized local correlations, enabling models to gradually enhance global\nlearning and thus understand complex correlations. Our implementation is based\non a 2-stage \\emph{Reinforced Self-Revised (RSR)} framework: \\emph{preview} and\n\\emph{review}. RSR first previews visual information to construct diverse\nattribute groups in a weakly-supervised manner. Then, it spirally learns\nrefined localities based on attribute groups and uses localities to revise\nglobal semantic correlations. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art\nalgorithms on four benchmark datasets in both zero-shot and generalized\nzero-shot settings, which demonstrates the effectiveness of spiral learning in\nlearning generalizable and complex correlations.

To tackle such difficulty, we utilise factor modelling to reduce\ndimension and capture temporal dependence simultaneously. A factor-based\nbootstrap procedure is constructed, which conducts AR-sieve bootstrap on the\nextracted low-dimensional common factor time series and then recovers the\nbootstrap samples for original data from the factor model. Asymptotic\nproperties for bootstrap mean statistics and extreme eigenvalues are\nestablished.

We show the network of systemic\nrisk-flows across the world. We find that rich countries expose poor countries\nmuch more to systemic risk than the other way round. We demonstrate that higher\nsystemic risk levels are not compensated with a risk premium in GDP, nor do\nthey correlate with economic growth. Systemic risk around the globe appears to\nbe distributed more unequally than wealth. These findings put the often praised\nbenefits for developing countries from globalized production in a new light,\nsince they relate them to the involved risks in the production processes.\nExposure risks present a new dimension of global inequality, that most affects\nthe poor in supply shock crises.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has been used in a range of simulated real-world\ntasks, e.g., sensor coordination, traffic light control, and on-demand mobility\nservices. However, real world deployments are rare, as RL struggles with\ndynamic nature of real world environments, requiring time for learning a task\nand adapting to changes in the environment. Transfer Learning (TL) can help\nlower these adaptation times. In particular, there is a significant potential\nof applying TL in multi-agent RL systems, where multiple agents can share\nknowledge with each other, as well as with new agents that join the system. To\nobtain the most from inter-agent transfer, transfer roles (i.e., determining\nwhich agents act as sources and which as targets), as well as relevant transfer\ncontent parameters (e.g., transfer size) should be selected dynamically in each\nparticular situation. As a first step towards fully dynamic transfers, in this\npaper we investigate the impact of TL transfer parameters with fixed source and\ntarget roles. Specifically, we label every agent-environment interaction with\nagent's epistemic confidence, and we filter the shared examples using varying\nthreshold levels and sample sizes. We investigate impact of these parameters in\ntwo scenarios, a standard predator-prey RL benchmark and a simulation of a\nride-sharing system with 200 vehicle agents and 10,000 ride-requests.",

      "title": "How to use Persistent Memory in your Database",
      "abstract": "Persistent or Non Volatile Memory (PMEM or NVM) has recently become\ncommercially available under several configurations with different purposes and\ngoals. Despite the attention to the topic, we are not aware of a comprehensive\nempirical analysis of existing relational database engines under different PMEM\nconfigurations. Such a study is important to understand the performance\nimplications of the various hardware configurations and how different DB\nengines can benefit from them. To this end, we analyze three different engines\n(PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLServer) under common workloads (TPC-C and TPC-H)\nwith all possible PMEM configurations supported by Intel's Optane NVM devices\n(PMEM as persistent memory in AppDirect mode and PMEM as volatile memory in\nMemory mode). Our results paint a complex picture and are not always intuitive\ndue to the many factors involved. Based on our findings, we provide insights on\nhow the different engines behave with PMEM and which configurations and queries\nperform best. Our results show that using PMEM as persistent storage usually\nspeeds up query execution, but with some caveats as the I/O path is not fully\noptimized. Additionally, using PMEM in Memory mode does not offer any\nperformance advantage despite the larger volatile memory capacity. Through the\nextensive coverage of engines and parameters, we provide an important starting\npoint for exploiting PMEM in databases and tuning relational engines to take\nadvantage of this new technology.",

Our differentiation is the\ndecomposition of the wider distribution shift of uncontrolled testing on\nin-the-wild data, to three distinct distribution shifts.

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth function and a\ncomposition of a zero-one loss function with a linear operator, namely zero-one\ncomposite optimization problem (0/1-COP). It is a versatile model including the\nsupport vector machine (SVM), multi-label classification (MLC), maximum rank\ncorrelation (MRC) and so on. However, due to the nonconvexity, discontinuity\nand NP-hardness of the 0/1-COP, it is intractable to design a globally\nconvergent algorithm and the work attempting to solve it directly is scarce. In\nthis paper, we first define and characterize the proximal stationarity to\nderive the minimum and the strongly exact penalization of the Lyapunov\nfunction, which is a variant of the augmented Lagrangian function for the\n0/1-COP. Based on this, we propose an inexact augmented Lagrangian method\n(IALM) for solving 0/1-COP, where the subproblem is solved by the zero-one\nBregman alternating linearized minimization (0/1-BALM) algorithm with low\ncomputational complexity. Under some suitable assumptions, we prove that the\nwhole sequence generated by the IALM converges to the local minimizer of\n0/1-COP. As a direct application, we obtain the global convergence of IALM\nunder the assumption that the data matrix is full row rank for solving the SVM,\nMLC and MRC.",
