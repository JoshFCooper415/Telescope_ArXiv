      "title": "Channelling Multimodality Through a Unimodalizing Transport: Warp-U\n  Sampler and Stochastic Bridge Sampling",
      "abstract": "Monte Carlo integration is fundamental in scientific and statistical\ncomputation, but requires reliable samples from the target distribution, which\nposes a substantial challenge in the case of multi-modal distributions.\nExisting methods often involve time-consuming tuning, and typically lack\ntailored estimators for efficient use of the samples. This paper adapts the\nWarp-U transformation [Wang et al., 2022] to form multi-modal sampling strategy\ncalled Warp-U sampling. It constructs a stochastic map to transport a\nmulti-modal density into a uni-modal one, and subsequently inverts the\ntransport but with new stochasticity injected. For efficient use of the samples\nfor normalising constant estimation, we propose (i) an unbiased estimation\nscheme based coupled chains, where the Warp-U sampling is used to reduce the\ncoupling time; and (ii) a stochastic Warp-U bridge sampling estimator, which\nimproves its deterministic counterpart given in Wang et al. [2022]. Our overall\napproach requires less tuning and is easier to apply than common alternatives.\nTheoretically, we establish the ergodicity of our sampling algorithm and that\nour stochastic Warp-U bridge sampling estimator has greater (asymptotic)\nprecision per CPU second compared to the Warp-U bridge estimator of Wang et al.\n[2022] under practical conditions. The advantages and current limitations of\nour approach are demonstrated through simulation studies and an application to\nexoplanet detection.",

Based on the variational framework of the\nMcKean-Vlasov system with jumps, it is turned into weak convergence for the\ncontrolled system. Unlike general two-time scale system, the controlled\nMcKean-Vlasov system is related to the law of the original system, which causes\ndifficulties in qualitative analysis. In solving this problem, employing\nasymptotics of the original system and a Khasminskii-type averaging principle\ntogether is efficient.

      "abstract": "Pre-training, which utilizes extensive and varied datasets, is a critical\nfactor in the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across numerous\napplications. However, the detailed makeup of these datasets is often not\ndisclosed, leading to concerns about data security and potential misuse. This\nis particularly relevant when copyrighted material, still under legal\nprotection, is used inappropriately, either intentionally or unintentionally,\ninfringing on the rights of the authors.\n  In this paper, we introduce a detailed framework designed to detect and\nassess the presence of content from potentially copyrighted books within the\ntraining datasets of LLMs. This framework also provides a confidence estimation\nfor the likelihood of each content sample's inclusion. To validate our\napproach, we conduct a series of simulated experiments, the results of which\naffirm the framework's effectiveness in identifying and addressing instances of\ncontent misuse in LLM training processes. Furthermore, we investigate the\npresence of recognizable quotes from famous literary works within these\ndatasets.

      "abstract": "The dominant paradigm for end-to-end robot learning focuses on optimizing\ntask-specific objectives that solve a single robotic problem such as picking up\nan object or reaching a target position. However, recent work on high-capacity\nmodels in robotics has shown promise toward being trained on large collections\nof diverse and task-agnostic datasets of video demonstrations. These models\nhave shown impressive levels of generalization to unseen circumstances,\nespecially as the amount of data and the model complexity scale. Surgical robot\nsystems that learn from data have struggled to advance as quickly as other\nfields of robot learning for a few reasons: (1) there is a lack of existing\nlarge-scale open-source data to train models, (2) it is challenging to model\nthe soft-body deformations that these robots work with during surgery because\nsimulation cannot match the physical and visual complexity of biological\ntissue, and (3) surgical robots risk harming patients when tested in clinical\ntrials and require more extensive safety measures. This perspective article\naims to provide a path toward increasing robot autonomy in robot-assisted\nsurgery through the development of a multi-modal, multi-task,\nvision-language-action model for surgical robots. Ultimately, we argue that\nsurgical robots are uniquely positioned to benefit from general-purpose models\nand provide three guiding actions toward increased autonomy in robot-assisted\nsurgery.",

      "title": "Benchmarking Large Language Models on Controllable Generation under\n  Diversified Instructions",
      "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive\ninstruction-following capabilities, it is still unclear whether and to what\nextent they can respond to explicit constraints that might be entailed in\nvarious instructions. As a significant aspect of LLM alignment, it is thus\nimportant to formulate such a specialized set of instructions as well as\ninvestigate the resulting behavior of LLMs. To address this vacancy, we propose\na new benchmark CoDI-Eval to systematically and comprehensively evaluate LLMs'\nresponses to instructions with various constraints. We construct a large\ncollection of constraints-attributed instructions as a test suite focused on\nboth generalization and coverage. Specifically, we advocate an instruction\ndiversification process to synthesize diverse forms of constraint expression\nand also deliberate the candidate task taxonomy with even finer-grained\nsub-categories. Finally, we automate the entire evaluation process to\nfacilitate further developments. Different from existing studies on\ncontrollable text generation, CoDI-Eval extends the scope to the prevalent\ninstruction-following paradigm for the first time. We provide extensive\nevaluations of representative LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Vicuna) on CoDI-Eval,\nrevealing their limitations in following instructions with specific constraints\nand there is still a significant gap between open-source and commercial\nclosed-source LLMs. We believe this benchmark will facilitate research into\nimproving the controllability of LLMs' responses to instructions.

Three-dimensional\nradiation-hydrodynamic (3D RHD) ``box-in-a-star'' simulations of stellar\natmospheres offer a more realistic representation of surface convection\noccurring in late-type stars compared to traditional one-dimensional (1D)\nhydrostatic models.

This review describes the ongoing and transformational work\nto advance the state-of-the-art and replace 1D LTE spectrum synthesis with its\n3D non-LTE counterpart. In summary:\n  1) 3D and non-LTE effects are intricately coupled and consistent modelling\nthereof is necessary for high-precision abundances, which is currently feasible\nfor individual elements in large surveys.

      "abstract": "In recent years, text-to-video retrieval methods based on CLIP have\nexperienced rapid development. The primary direction of evolution is to exploit\nthe much wider gamut of visual and textual cues to achieve alignment.\nConcretely, those methods with impressive performance often design a heavy\nfusion block for sentence (words)-video (frames) interaction, regardless of the\nprohibitive computation complexity. Nevertheless, these approaches are not\noptimal in terms of feature utilization and retrieval efficiency. To address\nthis issue, we adopt multi-granularity visual feature learning, ensuring the\nmodel's comprehensiveness in capturing visual content features spanning from\nabstract to detailed levels during the training phase. To better leverage the\nmulti-granularity features, we devise a two-stage retrieval architecture in the\nretrieval phase. This solution ingeniously balances the coarse and fine\ngranularity of retrieval content. Moreover, it also strikes a harmonious\nequilibrium between retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, in\ntraining phase, we design a parameter-free text-gated interaction block (TIB)\nfor fine-grained video representation learning and embed an extra Pearson\nConstraint to optimize cross-modal representation learning. In retrieval phase,\nwe use coarse-grained video representations for fast recall of top-k\ncandidates, which are then reranked by fine-grained video representations.\nExtensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and\neffectiveness. Notably, our method achieves comparable performance with the\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods while being nearly 50 times faster.",

      "abstract": "Nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) is an important prior that has been\nsuccessfully applied in multi-dimensional data processing tasks, e.g., image\nand video recovery. However, existing NSS-based methods are solely suitable for\nmeshgrid data such as images and videos, but are not suitable for emerging\noff-meshgrid data, e.g., point cloud and climate data. In this work, we revisit\nthe NSS from the continuous representation perspective and propose a novel\nContinuous Representation-based NonLocal method (termed as CRNL), which has two\ninnovative features as compared with classical nonlocal methods. First, based\non the continuous representation, our CRNL unifies the measure of\nself-similarity for on-meshgrid and off-meshgrid data and thus is naturally\nsuitable for both of them. Second, the nonlocal continuous groups can be more\ncompactly and efficiently represented by the coupled low-rank function\nfactorization, which simultaneously exploits the similarity within each group\nand across different groups, while classical nonlocal methods neglect the\nsimilarity across groups. This elaborately designed coupled mechanism allows\nour method to enjoy favorable performance over conventional NSS methods in\nterms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive multi-dimensional data\nprocessing experiments on-meshgrid (e.g., image inpainting and image denoising)\nand off-meshgrid (e.g., climate data prediction and point cloud recovery)\nvalidate the versatility, effectiveness, and efficiency of our CRNL as compared\nwith state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Integer sorting is a fundamental problem in computer science. This paper\nstudies parallel integer sort both in theory and in practice. In theory, we\nshow tighter bounds for a class of existing practical integer sort algorithms,\nwhich provides a solid theoretical foundation for their widespread usage in\npractice and strong performance. In practice, we design a new integer sorting\nalgorithm, \\textsf{DovetailSort}, that is theoretically-efficient and has good\npractical performance.\n  In particular, \\textsf{DovetailSort} overcomes a common challenge in existing\nparallel integer sorting algorithms, which is the difficulty of detecting and\ntaking advantage of duplicate keys. The key insight in \\textsf{DovetailSort} is\nto combine algorithmic ideas from both integer- and comparison-sorting\nalgorithms. In our experiments, \\textsf{DovetailSort} achieves competitive or\nbetter performance than existing state-of-the-art parallel integer and\ncomparison sorting algorithms on various synthetic and real-world datasets.",

      "title": "Steering of vortices by magnetic-field tilting in superconductor\n  nanotubes",
      "abstract": "In planar superconductor thin films, the places of nucleation and\narrangements of moving vortices are determined by structural defects. However,\nvarious applications of superconductors require reconfigurable steering of\nfluxons, which is hard to realize with geometrically predefined vortex pinning\nlandscapes. Here, on the basis of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation,\nwe present an approach for steering of vortex chains and vortex jets in\nsuperconductor nanotubes containing a slit. The idea is based on tilting of the\nmagnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ at an angle $\\alpha$ in the plane perpendicular to\nthe axis of a nanotube carrying an azimuthal transport current. Namely, while\nat $\\alpha=0^\\circ$ vortices move paraxially in opposite directions within each\nhalf-tube, an increase of $\\alpha$ displaces the areas with the\nclose-to-maximum normal component $|B_\\mathrm{n}|$ to the\nclose(opposite)-to-slit regions, giving rise to descending (ascending) branches\nin the induced-voltage frequency spectrum $f_\\mathrm{U}(\\alpha)$. At lower $B$,\nupon reaching the critical angle $\\alpha_\\mathrm{c}$, close-to-slit vortex\nchains disappear, yielding $f_\\mathrm{U}$ of the $nf_1$-type ($n\\geq1$: an\ninteger; $f_1$: vortex nucleation frequency). At higher $B$, $f_\\mathrm{U}$ is\nlargely blurry because of multifurcations of vortex trajectories, leading to\nthe coexistence of a vortex jet with two vortex chains at $\\alpha=90^\\circ$. In\naddition to prospects for tuning of GHz-frequency spectra and steering of\nvortices as information bits, our findings lay foundations for on-demand tuning\nof vortex arrangements in 3D superconductor membranes in tilted magnetic\nfields.",

      "title": "Dynamics of the Beta Pictoris planetary system and its falling\n  evaporating bodies",
      "abstract": "For decades, the spectral variations of Beta Pictoris have been modelled as\nthe result of the evaporation of exocomets close to the star, termed falling\nevaporating bodies (FEBs). Resonant perturbations by a giant planet have been\nproposed to explain the dynamical origin of these stargrazers. The disk is now\nknown to harbour two giant planets, Beta Pic b and c, orbiting the star at 9.9\nau and 2.7 au. While the former almost matches the planet formerly suspected,\nthe discovery of the latter complicates the picture. We first question the\nstability of the two-planet system. Then we investigate the dynamics of a disk\nof planetesimals orbiting the star with both planets to check the validity of\nthe FEB generation mechanism. Symplectic N-body simulations are used to\ndetermine which regions of the planetesimal disk are dynamically stable. Then\nwe focus on regions where disk particles are able to reach high eccentricities\nthanks to resonant mechanisms. The first result is that the system is\ndynamically stable. Both planets may temporarily fall in 7:1 mean motion\nresonance (MMR). Then, simulations reveal that the whole region extending\nbetween ~1.5 au and ~25 au is unstable to planetary perturbations. However, a\ndisk below 1.5 au survives, which appears to constitute an active source of\nFEBs via high-order MMRs with Beta Pic c. Beta Pic b acts as a distant\nperturber that helps sustain the whole process. These simulations rule out the\npreceding FEB generation mechanism model, which placed their origin at around\n4-5 au. Conversely, FEBs are likely to originate from a region much further in\nand related to MMRs with Beta Pic c. That mechanism also appears to last\nlonger, as new planetesimals are able to continuously enter the MMRs and evolve\ntowards the FEB state. Subsequently, the physical nature of the FEBs may differ\nfrom that previously thought, and presumably may not be icy.",

      "abstract": "The occurrence of asymmetric rolling moments in wraparound fin (WAF)\nprojectiles, even at zero free stream angle of attack, and their potential to\ninduce roll reversal and resonant instabilities has long been recognized. The\ninduced rolling moment is seen to flip sign depending on the WAF configuration\n(with concave surface leading into the roll or vice versa), and between\nsubsonic and supersonic Mach numbers. In this work, we propose a simple\nmechanism that can explain the anomalous rolling behavior of WAF projectiles in\nthe subsonic regime. By modeling the curved fin by discrete span-wise linear\nsegments, the wraparound fin can be approximated as a wing with a deflected\nwinglet, and the experimental data available in the literature for such wing\nconfigurations can be applied to the curved fin of WAF projectiles. The lifting\ncharacteristic of the curved fin can be seen to differ depending on whether the\nwingtip appears to be deflected up or down relative to the local flow incidence\nangle. Based on this differential lift between a pair of oppositely-placed\ncurved fins on a WAF rocket, it becomes possible to explain the observed sign\nof the induced rolling moment as well as its dependence on the free stream\nangle of attack for small values of the angle of attack. The physical mechanism\nfor the differential lift, and hence the induced rolling moment, can be traced\nto the span-wise location and the liftoff height of the tip vortex from the\nwraparound fin tips.",

      "abstract": "Existing deep-learning-based methods for nighttime video deraining rely on\nsynthetic data due to the absence of real-world paired data. However, the\nintricacies of the real world, particularly with the presence of light effects\nand low-light regions affected by noise, create significant domain gaps,\nhampering synthetic-trained models in removing rain streaks properly and\nleading to over-saturation and color shifts. Motivated by this, we introduce\nNightRain, a novel nighttime video deraining method with adaptive-rain-removal\nand adaptive-correction. Our adaptive-rain-removal uses unlabeled rain videos\nto enable our model to derain real-world rain videos, particularly in regions\naffected by complex light effects. The idea is to allow our model to obtain\nrain-free regions based on the confidence scores. Once rain-free regions and\nthe corresponding regions from our input are obtained, we can have region-based\npaired real data. These paired data are used to train our model using a\nteacher-student framework, allowing the model to iteratively learn from less\nchallenging regions to more challenging regions. Our adaptive-correction aims\nto rectify errors in our model's predictions, such as over-saturation and color\nshifts. The idea is to learn from clear night input training videos based on\nthe differences or distance between those input videos and their corresponding\npredictions. Our model learns from these differences, compelling our model to\ncorrect the errors. From extensive experiments, our method demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art performance. It achieves a PSNR of 26.73dB, surpassing\nexisting nighttime video deraining methods by a substantial margin of 13.7%.",

      "abstract": "The perfectly matched layers method is a well known truncation technique for\nits efficiency and convenience in numerical implementations of wave scattering\nproblems in unbounded domains. In this paper, we study the convergence of the\nperfectly matched layers (PML) for wave scattering from a local perturbation of\nan open waveguide in the half space above the real line, where the refractive\nindex is a function which is periodic along the axis of the waveguide and\nequals to one above a finite height. The problem is challenging due to the\nexistence of guided waves, and a typical way to deal with the difficulty is to\napply the limiting absorption principle. Based on the Floquet-Bloch transform\nand a curve deformation theory, the solution from the limiting absorption\nprinciple is rewritten as the integral of a coupled family of quasi-periodic\nproblems with respect to the quasi-periodicity parameter on a particularly\ndesigned curve. By comparing the Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on a straight line\nabove the locally perturbed periodic layer, we finally show that the PML method\nconverges exponentially with respect to the PML parameter. Finally, the\nnumerical examples are shown to illustrate the theoretical results.",

In the extreme case the very large anisotropy leads to the unity of\nthe complexity growth rate and complexity itself, it means that in this case\ngetting the target state from the reference state is reachable by no effort.\nMoreover, we suggest that $\\frac{1}{M}\\frac{dC}{dt}$ is a better representation\nof system degrees of freedom rather than the complexity growth rate\n$\\frac{dC}{dt}$ and show that how it is related to inverse anisotropic\ncatalysis.

      "abstract": "Constant weight codes (CWCs) and constant composition codes (CCCs) are two\nimportant classes of codes that have been studied extensively in both\ncombinatorics and coding theory for nearly sixty years. In this paper we show\nthat for {\\it all} fixed odd distances, there exist near-optimal CWCs and CCCs\nasymptotically achieving the classic Johnson-type upper bounds.\n  Let $A_q(n,w,d)$ denote the maximum size of $q$-ary CWCs of length $n$ with\nconstant weight $w$ and minimum distance $d$.

      "abstract": "The structure of a network has a major effect on dynamical processes on that\nnetwork. Many studies of the interplay between network structure and dynamics\nhave focused on models of phenomena such as disease spread, opinion formation\nand changes, coupled oscillators, and random walks. In parallel to these\ndevelopments, there have been many studies of wave propagation and other\nspatially extended processes on networks. These latter studies consider metric\nnetworks, in which the edges are associated with real intervals. Metric\nnetworks give a mathematical framework to describe dynamical processes that\ninclude both temporal and spatial evolution of some quantity of interest --\nsuch as the concentration of a diffusing substance or the amplitude of a wave\n-- by using edge-specific intervals that quantify distance information between\nnodes. Dynamical processes on metric networks often take the form of partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we present a collection of\ntechniques and paradigmatic linear PDEs that are useful to investigate the\ninterplay between structure and dynamics in metric networks. We start by\nconsidering a time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation. We then use both\nfinite-difference and spectral approaches to study the Poisson, heat, and wave\nequations as paradigmatic examples of elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDE\nproblems on metric networks. Our spectral approach is able to account for\ndegenerate eigenmodes. In our numerical experiments, we consider metric\nnetworks with up to about $10^4$ nodes and about $10^4$ edges. A key\ncontribution of our paper is to increase the accessibility of studying PDEs on\nmetric networks.

      "abstract": "The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in\nlight field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of\nconvolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area.\nNevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many\nexisting methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional\nsubspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side\neffect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a\nOne-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly\npreventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this\npaper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel\nMany-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular\ninformation in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention\nmechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all\nsub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is\nenabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With\nM2MT as the pivotal component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network\nfor LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various public datasets. We further conduct\nin-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual\ninterpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly\nnon-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace\nisolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.",

      "abstract": "Machine translation systems have been widely adopted in our daily life,\nmaking life easier and more convenient. Unfortunately, erroneous translations\nmay result in severe consequences, such as financial losses. This requires to\nimprove the accuracy and the reliability of machine translation systems.\nHowever, it is challenging to test machine translation systems because of the\ncomplexity and intractability of the underlying neural models. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a novel metamorphic testing approach by syntactic tree\npruning (STP) to validate machine translation systems. Our key insight is that\na pruned sentence should have similar crucial semantics compared with the\noriginal sentence. Specifically, STP (1) proposes a core semantics-preserving\npruning strategy by basic sentence structure and dependency relations on the\nlevel of syntactic tree representation; (2) generates source sentence pairs\nbased on the metamorphic relation; (3) reports suspicious issues whose\ntranslations break the consistency property by a bag-of-words model. We further\nevaluate STP on two state-of-the-art machine translation systems (i.e., Google\nTranslate and Bing Microsoft Translator) with 1,200 source sentences as inputs.\nThe results show that STP can accurately find 5,073 unique erroneous\ntranslations in Google Translate and 5,100 unique erroneous translations in\nBing Microsoft Translator (400% more than state-of-the-art techniques), with\n64.5% and 65.4% precision, respectively. The reported erroneous translations\nvary in types and more than 90% of them cannot be found by state-of-the-art\ntechniques. There are 9,393 erroneous translations unique to STP, which is\n711.9% more than state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, STP is quite effective\nto detect translation errors for the original sentences with a recall reaching\n74.0%, improving state-of-the-art techniques by 55.1% on average.",

      "abstract": "Post-stack seismic inversion is a widely used technique to retrieve\nhigh-resolution acoustic impedance models from migrated seismic data. Its\nmodelling operator assumes that a migrated seismic data can be generated from\nthe convolution of a source wavelet and the time derivative of the acoustic\nimpedance model. Given the band-limited nature of the seismic wavelet, the\nconvolutional model acts as a filtering operator on the acoustic impedance\nmodel, thereby making the problem of retrieving acoustic impedances from\nseismic data ambiguous. In order to compensate for missing frequencies,\npost-stack seismic inversion is often regularized, meaning that prior\ninformation about the structure of the subsurface is included in the inversion\nprocess. Recently, the Plug-and-Play methodology has gained wide interest in\nthe inverse problem community as a new form of implicit regularization, often\noutperforming state-of-the-art regularization. Plug-and-Play can be applied to\nany proximal algorithm by simply replacing the proximal operator of the\nregularizer with any denoiser of choice. We propose to use Plug-and-Play\nregularization with a 2D pre-trained, deep denoiser for 2D post-stack seismic\ninversion. Additionally, we show that a generalization of Plug-and-Play, called\nMulti-Agent Consensus Equilibrium, can be adopted to solve 3D post-stack\ninversion whilst leveraging the same 2D pre-trained denoiser used in the 2D\ncase. More precisely, Multi-Agent Consensus Equilibrium combines the results of\napplying such 2D denoiser in the inline, crossline, and time directions in an\noptimal manner. We verify the proposed methods on a portion of the SEAM Phase 1\nvelocity model and the Sleipner field dataset. 1",

      "abstract": "The crux of graph classification lies in the effective representation\nlearning for the entire graph. Typical graph neural networks focus on modeling\nthe local dependencies when aggregating features of neighboring nodes, and\nobtain the representation for the entire graph by aggregating node features.\nSuch methods have two potential limitations: 1) the global node saliency w.r.t.\ngraph classification is not explicitly modeled, which is crucial since\ndifferent nodes may have different semantic relevance to graph classification;\n2) the graph representation directly aggregated from node features may have\nlimited effectiveness to reflect graph-level information. In this work, we\npropose the Saliency-Aware Regularized Graph Neural Network (SAR-GNN) for graph\nclassification, which consists of two core modules: 1) a traditional graph\nneural network serving as the backbone for learning node features and 2) the\nGraph Neural Memory designed to distill a compact graph representation from\nnode features of the backbone. We first estimate the global node saliency by\nmeasuring the semantic similarity between the compact graph representation and\nnode features. Then the learned saliency distribution is leveraged to\nregularize the neighborhood aggregation of the backbone, which facilitates the\nmessage passing of features for salient nodes and suppresses the less relevant\nnodes. Thus, our model can learn more effective graph representation. We\ndemonstrate the merits of SAR-GNN by extensive experiments on seven datasets\nacross various types of graph data.

Although various existing works have\nachieved remarkable progress, the model performance can be further improved by\nfully extracting the trends, variations, and the correlation between the trends\nand variations in dynamic features. In addition, sparse visit records limit the\nperformance of deep learning models. To address these issues, we propose the\nMulti-perspective Patient Representation Extractor (MPRE) for disease\nprediction. Specifically, we propose Frequency Transformation Module (FTM) to\nextract the trend and variation information of dynamic features in the\ntime-frequency domain, which can enhance the feature representation. In the 2D\nMulti-Extraction Network (2D MEN), we form the 2D temporal tensor based on\ntrend and variation. Then, the correlations between trend and variation are\ncaptured by the proposed dilated operation. Moreover, we propose the\nFirst-Order Difference Attention Mechanism (FODAM) to calculate the\ncontributions of differences in adjacent variations to the disease diagnosis\nadaptively.

Here we study the spin dynamics of a ferromagnetic\nKondo-Heisenberg lattice model at finite temperature, and propose a mechanism\nof magnon damping that explains the intriguing experimental results. In\nparticular, we find the magnon damping rate $\\gamma(T)$ firstly decreases as\ntemperature lowers, due to the reduced magnon-magnon scatterings. It then\nreaches a minimum at $T_{\\rm d}^*$, and rises up again following a logarithmic\nscaling $\\gamma(T) \\sim \\ln{(T_0/T)}$ (with $T_0$ a constant) for $T < T_{\\rm\nd}^*$, which can be attributed to electron-magnon scatterings of spin-flip\ntype. Moreover, we obtain the phase diagram containing the ferromagnetic and\nKondo insulator phases by varying the Kondo coupling, which may be relevant for\nexperiments on pressured FGT. The presence of a magnon damping minimum and\nlogarithmic scaling at low temperature indicates the emergence of the Kondo\neffect reflected in the collective excitations of local moments in a Kondo\nlattice system.",

Despite this, they are prone to generating factual and commonsense\nerrors, raising concerns in critical areas like healthcare, journalism, and\neducation to mislead users. Current methods for evaluating LLMs' veracity are\nlimited by test data leakage or the need for extensive human labor, hindering\nefficient and accurate error detection. To tackle this problem, we introduce a\nnovel, automatic testing framework, FactChecker, aimed at uncovering factual\ninaccuracies in LLMs. This framework involves three main steps: First, it\nconstructs a factual knowledge graph by retrieving fact triplets from a\nlarge-scale knowledge database. Then, leveraging the knowledge graph,\nFactChecker employs a rule-based approach to generates three types of questions\n(Yes-No, Multiple-Choice, and WH questions) that involve single-hop and\nmulti-hop relations, along with correct answers. Lastly, it assesses the LLMs'\nresponses for accuracy using tailored matching strategies for each question\ntype. Our extensive tests on six prominent LLMs, including text-davinci-002,\ntext-davinci-003, ChatGPT~(gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4), Vicuna, and LLaMA-2, reveal\nthat FactChecker can trigger factual errors in up to 45\\% of questions in these\nmodels. Moreover, we demonstrate that FactChecker's test cases can improve\nLLMs' factual accuracy through in-context learning and fine-tuning (e.g.,\nllama-2-13b-chat's accuracy increase from 35.3\\% to 68.5\\%).

In today's world, security\nhas become an inevitable part of our day-to-day life, right from normal\nbrowsing to performing critical payment transactions. Hackers work endlessly to\nbreak the security present in the apps/websites on which we perform day-to-day\noperations and salvage valuable information. Because of this, many illegal\nactivities have taken place which affect the user. One such illegal activity is\ntapping the voice communication between two users. If left unencrypted, the\ncommunication between the users is compromised, thereby causing issues. One way\nto prevent this act is to encrypt the audio in that the contents cannot have\ntampered with unless the receiver has the valid key to decrypt it. The proposed\nsolution termed \"HexE\" aims to create a puzzle-based algorithm which would\nencrypt and decrypt the audio files without manipulating the file header, thus\nsecuring the contents. The algorithm works on an NxN SuDoKu-based puzzle which\nis accepted both by the sender and receiver. Using the timestamp of the event\n(UNIX based), a grid from the puzzle is chosen which in turn will act as the\nkey for both encryption and decryption. If the timestamp is slightly adjusted,\nthe process will end up in failure during decryption, thus ensuring\nconfidentiality. Another approach to secure the audio files is to implement\nIPFS (Inter Planetary File System) alongside the puzzle algorithm in which the\nencrypted audio is stored on it and the receiver can fetch the audio provided\nif the valid IPFS Hash of the file is present. In this way, the audio file is\nsecured.",

We show that the ellipticity of stars deformed by such a\nLorentz force is of the same order of magnitude as previous theoretical and\nastrophysical constraints.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a theoretical, experimental, and numerical study of\nthe dynamics of cavitation bubbles inside a droplet suspended in another host\nfluid. On the theoretical side, we provided a modified Rayleigh collapse time\nand natural frequency for spherical bubbles in our particular context,\ncharacterized by the density ratio between the two liquids and the\nbubble-to-droplet size ratio. Regarding the experimental aspect, experiments\nwere carried out for laser-induced cavitation bubbles inside oil-in-water (O/W)\nor water-in-oil (W/O) droplets. Two distinct fluid-mixing mechanisms were\nunveiled in the two systems, respectively. In the case of O/W droplets, a\nliquid jet emerges around the end of the bubble collapse phase, effectively\npenetrating the droplet interface. We offer a detailed analysis of the criteria\ngoverning jet penetration, involving the standoff parameter and impact velocity\nof the bubble jet on the droplet surface. Conversely, in the scenario involving\nW/O droplets, the bubble traverses the droplet interior, inducing global motion\nand eventually leading to droplet pinch-off when the local Weber number exceeds\na critical value. This phenomenon is elucidated through the equilibrium between\ninterfacial and kinetic energies. Lastly, our boundary integral model\nfaithfully reproduces the essential physics of nonspherical bubble dynamics\nobserved in the experiments. We conduct a parametric study spanning a wide\nparameter space to investigate bubble-droplet interactions.

      "abstract": "Processors with extensible instruction sets are often used today as\nprogrammable hardware accelerators for various domains. When extending RISC-V\nand other similar extensible processor architectures, the task of designing\nspecialized instructions arises. This task can be solved automatically by using\ninstruction synthesis algorithms. In this paper, we consider algorithms that\ncan be used in addition to the known approaches and improve the synthesized\ninstruction sets by recomputing common operations (the result of which is\nconsumed by multiple operations) of a program inside clustered synthesized\ninstructions (common operations clustering algorithm), and by identifying\nredundant (which have equivalents among the other instructions) synthesized\ninstructions (subsuming functions algorithm).\n  Experimental evaluations of the developed algorithms are presented for the\ntests from the domains of cryptography and three-dimensional graphics. For\nMagma cipher test, the common operations clustering algorithm allows reducing\nthe size of the compiled code by 9%, and the subsuming functions algorithm\nallows reducing the synthesized instruction set extension size by 2 times. For\nAES cipher test, the common operations clustering algorithm allows reducing the\nsize of the compiled code by 10%, and the subsuming functions algorithm allows\nreducing the synthesized instruction set extension size by 2.5 times. Finally,\nfor the instruction set extension from Volume Ray-Casting test, the additional\nuse of subsuming functions algorithm allows reducing problem-specific\ninstruction extension set size from 5 to only 2 instructions without losing its\nfunctionality.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, edge computing has served as a paradigm that enables many\nfuture technologies like AI, Robotics, IoT, and high-speed wireless sensor\nnetworks (like 5G) by connecting cloud computing facilities and services to the\nend users. Especially in medical and healthcare applications, it provides\nremote patient monitoring and increases voluminous multimedia. From the\nrobotics angle, robot-assisted therapy (RAT) is an active-assistive robotic\ntechnology in rehabilitation robotics, attracting many researchers to study and\nbenefit people with disability like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children.\nHowever, the main challenge of RAT is that the model capable of detecting the\naffective states of ASD people exists and can recall individual preferences.\nMoreover, involving expert diagnosis and recommendations to guide robots in\nupdating the therapy approach to adapt to different statuses and scenarios is a\ncrucial part of the ASD therapy process. This paper proposes the architecture\nof edge cognitive computing by combining human experts and assisted robots\ncollaborating in the same framework to help ASD patients with long-term\nsupport. By integrating the real-time computing and analysis of a new cognitive\nrobotic model for ASD therapy, the proposed architecture can achieve a seamless\nremote diagnosis, round-the-clock symptom monitoring, emergency warning,\ntherapy alteration, and advanced assistance.",

      "abstract": "Highway traffic crashes exert a considerable impact on both transportation\nsystems and the economy. In this context, accurate and dependable emergency\nresponses are crucial for effective traffic management. However, the influence\nof crashes on traffic status varies across diverse factors and may be biased\ndue to selection bias. Therefore, there arises a necessity to accurately\nestimate the heterogeneous causal effects of crashes, thereby providing\nessential insights to facilitate individual-level emergency decision-making.\nThis paper proposes a novel causal machine learning framework to estimate the\ncausal effect of different types of crashes on highway speed. The Neyman-Rubin\nCausal Model (RCM) is employed to formulate this problem from a causal\nperspective. The Conditional Shapley Value Index (CSVI) is proposed based on\ncausal graph theory to filter adverse variables, and the Structural Causal\nModel (SCM) is then adopted to define the statistical estimand for causal\neffects. The treatment effects are estimated by Doubly Robust Learning (DRL)\nmethods, which combine doubly robust causal inference with classification and\nregression machine learning models. Experimental results from 4815 crashes on\nHighway Interstate 5 in Washington State reveal the heterogeneous treatment\neffects of crashes at varying distances and durations. The rear-end crashes\ncause more severe congestion and longer durations than other types of crashes,\nand the sideswipe crashes have the longest delayed impact. Additionally, the\nfindings show that rear-end crashes affect traffic greater at night, while\ncrash to objects has the most significant influence during peak hours.\nStatistical hypothesis tests, error metrics based on matched \"counterfactual\noutcomes\", and sensitive analyses are employed for assessment, and the results\nvalidate the accuracy and effectiveness of our method.",

To better understand the\nphysics involved in this experiment, we have developed a quantum master\nequation theory by treating the Rubidium atoms as three-level systems, and\ncoupling them with a dressed laser and an optical cavity. Our simulations show\ndifferent superradiant Raman scattering pulses for the systems within the\ncrossover and strong coupling regime, and the shifted and broader spectrum of\nthe steady-state Raman scattering. Thus, our studies provide a unified view on\nthe superradiant Raman scattering pulses, and an alternative explanation to the\nbroad spectrum of the steady-state Raman scattering, as observed in the\nexperiment. In future, our theory can be readily applied to study other\ninteresting phenomena relying on the superradiant Raman scattering, such as\nmagnetic field sensing, real-time tracking of quantum phase, Dicke phase\ntransition of non-equilibrium dynamics and so on.",

We introduce Astraios, a suite of 28\ninstruction-tuned OctoCoder models using 7 tuning methods and 4 model sizes up\nto 16 billion parameters. Through investigations across 5 tasks and 8 different\ndatasets encompassing both code comprehension and code generation tasks, we\nfind that FFT generally leads to the best downstream performance across all\nscales, and PEFT methods differ significantly in their efficacy based on the\nmodel scale. LoRA usually offers the most favorable trade-off between cost and\nperformance. Further investigation into the effects of these methods on both\nmodel robustness and code security reveals that larger models tend to\ndemonstrate reduced robustness and less security.

We\nobserve that, more generally, under some conditions on a compact space endowed\nwith a finite Borel measure an analogous Polish group topology can be defined\non the subgroup of the homeomorphism group which push forward the measure to\nanother one with which it is mutually absolutely continuous. We use a\nprobabilistic argument involving approximations by supmartingale processes to\nshow that in many cases there is no group topology between $\\tau_{ac}$ and the\nrestriction $\\tau_{co}$ of the compact-open topology.

The standard deviation around a best-fit curve ranges\nfrom 0.14 to 0.34 magnitude, smaller than most previous estimates. The\ndifference in scatter between stars is significant, but does not correlate with\nsuch things as range or quickness of variation, or even with color. Naked-eye\nvariables, which would be expected to be more difficult to observe accurately,\nin fact show the smallest scatter. The difference between observers (bias) is\nless important than each observer's internal precision. A given observer's\nprecision is not set but varies from star to star for unknown reasons.

      "abstract": "Stellar evolution theory predicts the existence of He-core remnants of the\nprimary components of intermediate-mass close binaries that lost most of their\nH/He envelopes due to the mass exchange. They are expected to be observed as\n(1-7) solar mass hot He-rich stars located in the HRD between sdO/B and\nWR-stars. Several thousands of such stars are expected to exist in the Galaxy,\nbut none of them have been identified so far. We aim to provide comprehensive\npredictions of the numbers and fundamental properties of He-stars and their\ncompanions in the Galaxy. This is a necessary first step to guide observations,\nto enable a comparison between evolutionary models and observed populations,\nand to determine the feedback of He-stars in the Galaxy. We expanded the\npreviously considered space of parameters describing progenitors of He-stars\nand applied a population synthesis based on a grid of models computed by the\ncode MESA. The estimated number of Galactic binaries hosting (1-7) solar mass\nHe-stars is about 20000; it declines to about 3000 for mass exceeding two solar\nones. The decisive factor that defines the number of He-stars is runaway mass\nloss after Roche lobe overflow by primary components, resulting in formation of\ncommon envelopes and merger of components. He-stars are much less numerous than\nexpected, since a fraction of close binaries with primary masses below (5-7)\nsolar ones produce subdwarfs with masses below solar. Overwhelming majority of\nHe-stars reside in binaries with an early-type companions and can be identified\nneither by the UV excess nor by emission features. The large periods of a\nsignificant fraction of binaries hosting stripped stars (exceeding several\nhundred days) also hamper their discovery. (Abridged).",

Community acceptance of aircraft noise is among the most\nnoticeable of these challenges when launching or scaling up a UAM system.\nProperly managing community noise is fundamental to establishing a UAM system\nthat is environmentally and socially sustainable. In this work, we develop a\nholistic and equitable approach to manage UAM air traffic and its community\nnoise impact in urban environments. The proposed approach is a hybrid approach\nthat considers a mix of different noise mitigation strategies, including\nlimiting the number of operations, cruising at higher altitudes, and ambient\nnoise masking. We tackle the problem through the lens of network system control\nand formulate a multi-objective optimization model for managing traffic flow in\na multi-layer UAM network while concurrently pursuing demand fulfillment, noise\ncontrol, and energy saving. Further, we use a social welfare function in the\noptimization model as the basis for the efficiency-fairness trade-off in both\ndemand fulfillment and noise control. We apply the proposed approach to a\ncomprehensive case study in the city of Austin and perform design trade-offs\nthrough both visual and quantitative analyses.",

The velocities are used with a rotation\ncurve to refine the distances to the clumps and to calculate the clumps'\nproperties using a distance-dependent gas-to-dust ratio. We have determined\nreliable physical parameters for 3200 outer Galaxy dense clumps (~90% of the\nHiGAL sources in the region). We find a trend of decreasing luminosity-to-mass\nratio with increasing Galactocentric distance, suggesting the star formation\nefficiency is lower in the outer Galaxy or that it is resulting in more lower\nmass stars than in the inner Galaxy.

      "abstract": "The prominent large language models (LLMs) of today differ from past language\nmodels not only in size, but also in the fact that they are trained on a\ncombination of natural language and formal language (code).

In\nthis survey, we present an overview of the various benefits of integrating code\ninto LLMs' training data. Specifically, beyond enhancing LLMs in code\ngeneration, we observe that these unique properties of code help (i) unlock the\nreasoning ability of LLMs, enabling their applications to a range of more\ncomplex natural language tasks; (ii) steer LLMs to produce structured and\nprecise intermediate steps, which can then be connected to external execution\nends through function calls; and (iii) take advantage of code compilation and\nexecution environment, which also provides diverse feedback for model\nimprovement. In addition, we trace how these profound capabilities of LLMs,\nbrought by code, have led to their emergence as intelligent agents (IAs) in\nsituations where the ability to understand instructions, decompose goals, plan\nand execute actions, and refine from feedback are crucial to their success on\ndownstream tasks. Finally, we present several key challenges and future\ndirections of empowering LLMs with code.",

      "abstract": "By 2050, it is predicted that there will be 9 billion people on the planet,\nwhich will call for more production, lower costs, and the preservation of\nnatural resources. It is anticipated that atypical occurrences and climate\nchange will pose severe risks to agricultural output. It follows that a 70% or\nmore significant rise in food output is anticipated. Smart farming, often known\nas agriculture 4.0, is a tech-driven revolution in agriculture with the goal of\nraising industry production and efficiency. Four primary trends are responsible\nfor it: food waste, climate change, population shifts, and resource scarcity.\nThe agriculture industry is changing as a result of the adoption of emerging\ntechnologies. Using cutting-edge technology like IoT, AI, and other sensors,\nsmart farming transforms traditional production methods and international\nagricultural policies. The objective is to establish a value chain that is\noptimized to facilitate enhanced monitoring and decreased labor expenses. The\nagricultural sector has seen tremendous transformation as a result of the\nfourth industrial revolution, which has combined traditional farming methods\nwith cutting-edge technology to increase productivity, sustainability, and\nefficiency. To effectively utilize the potential of technology gadgets in the\nagriculture sector, collaboration between governments, private sector entities,\nand other stakeholders is necessary. This paper covers Agriculture 4.0, looks\nat its possible benefits and drawbacks of the implementation methodologies,\ncompatibility, reliability, and investigates the several digital tools that are\nbeing utilized to change the agriculture industry and how to mitigate the\nchallenges.",

      "abstract": "Removing shadows requires an understanding of both lighting conditions and\nobject textures in a scene. Existing methods typically learn pixel-level color\nmappings between shadow and non-shadow images, in which the joint modeling of\nlighting and object textures is implicit and inadequate. We observe that in a\nshadow region, the degradation degree of object textures depends on the local\nillumination, while simply enhancing the local illumination cannot fully\nrecover the attenuated textures. Based on this observation, we propose to\ncondition the restoration of attenuated textures on the corrected local\nlighting in the shadow region. Specifically, We first design a shadow-aware\ndecomposition network to estimate the illumination and reflectance layers of\nshadow regions explicitly. We then propose a novel bilateral correction network\nto recast the lighting of shadow regions in the illumination layer via a novel\nlocal lighting correction module, and to restore the textures conditioned on\nthe corrected illumination layer via a novel illumination-guided texture\nrestoration module. We further annotate pixel-wise shadow masks for the public\nSRD dataset, which originally contains only image pairs. Experiments on three\nbenchmarks show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art shadow\nremoval methods.",

As the adsorption of OH fragment on top of the\nsurfaces is known as the limiting factor in the Oxygen Reduction Reactions\n(ORR) process in these systems, our calculations propose to determine the\ninfluence of the local geometry of the various sites on the adsorption energy\nof OH in order to discover a simple descriptor allowing to predict the\nreactivity at these surfaces as a function of their morphology and strain. For\nthis purpose, the geometry of Pt slabs with various thickness (3, 5 and 7\natomic layers) including a large number of point defects are optimized in order\nto generate a very rich catalog of inequivalent sites of reactivity on both\nsurfaces of the slabs. Given the very large distortion of the geometry of the\nsites, these latter had to be categorized into several classes for which the\nbehavior with respect to catalytic activity is determined.

The present paper focuses on the application of MPC to a Rijke\ntube, in which a heating source and acoustic dynamics interact to produce\nself-excited oscillations. Since the dynamics of a Rijke tube are difficult to\nmodel to a high level of accuracy, the implementation of MPC requires\nleveraging data from the physical setup as well as knowledge about\nthermoacoustics, which is labor intensive and requires domain expertise. With\nthis motivation, the present paper uses predictive cost adaptive control (PCAC)\nfor sampled-data control of an experimental Rijke-tube setup. PCAC performs\nonline closed-loop linear model identification for receding-horizon\noptimization based on the backward propagating Riccati equation. In place of\nanalytical modeling, open-loop experiments are used to create a simple\nemulation model, which is used for choosing PCAC hyperparameters.

      "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the DIstribution Correction Estimation (DICE)\nmethods, an important line of work in offline reinforcement learning (RL) and\nimitation learning (IL). DICE-based methods impose state-action-level behavior\nconstraint, which is an ideal choice for offline learning. However, they\ntypically perform much worse than current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that\nsolely use action-level behavior constraint. After revisiting DICE-based\nmethods, we find there exist two gradient terms when learning the value\nfunction using true-gradient update: forward gradient (taken on the current\nstate) and backward gradient (taken on the next state). Using forward gradient\nbears a large similarity to many offline RL methods, and thus can be regarded\nas applying action-level constraint. However, directly adding the backward\ngradient may degenerate or cancel out its effect if these two gradients have\nconflicting directions. To resolve this issue, we propose a simple yet\neffective modification that projects the backward gradient onto the normal\nplane of the forward gradient, resulting in an orthogonal-gradient update, a\nnew learning rule for DICE-based methods. We conduct thorough theoretical\nanalyses and find that the projected backward gradient brings state-level\nbehavior regularization, which reveals the mystery of DICE-based methods: the\nvalue learning objective does try to impose state-action-level constraint, but\nneeds to be used in a corrected way. Through toy examples and extensive\nexperiments on complex offline RL and IL tasks, we demonstrate that DICE-based\nmethods using orthogonal-gradient updates (O-DICE) achieve SOTA performance and\ngreat robustness.",

The resulting local controllers are then pieced\ntogether using gain scheduling. For applications in which the aerodynamics are\nunmodeled, the present paper proposes an autopilot based on predictive cost\nadaptive control (PCAC). As an indirect adaptive control extension of model\npredictive control, PCAC uses recursive least squares (RLS) with variable-rate\nforgetting for online, closed-loop system identification. At each time step,\nRLS-based system identification updates the coefficients of an input-output\nmodel whose order is a hyperparameter specified by the user. For MPC, the\nreceding-horizon optimization can be performed by either the\nbackward-propagating Riccati equation or quadratic programming. The present\npaper investigates the performance of PCAC for fixed-wing aircraft without the\nuse of any aerodynamic modeling or offline/prior data collection.",

In practice however,\napplying primal-dual methods to SRL is challenging, due to the inter-dependency\nof the learning rate (LR) and Lagrangian multipliers (dual variables) each time\nan embedded unconstrained RL problem is solved. In this paper, we propose,\nanalyze and evaluate adaptive primal-dual (APD) methods for SRL, where two\nadaptive LRs are adjusted to the Lagrangian multipliers so as to optimize the\npolicy in each iteration. We theoretically establish the convergence,\noptimality and feasibility of the APD algorithm. Finally, we conduct numerical\nevaluation of the practical APD algorithm with four well-known environments in\nBullet-Safey-Gym employing two state-of-the-art SRL algorithms: PPO-Lagrangian\nand DDPG-Lagrangian. All experiments show that the practical APD algorithm\noutperforms (or achieves comparable performance) and attains more stable\ntraining than the constant LR cases. Additionally, we substantiate the\nrobustness of selecting the two adaptive LRs by empirical evidence.",

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of collision cascades\nin W have been carried out using five interatomic potentials (IAP) including\nthe quantum accurate machine learned (ML) spectral neighbor analysis potential\n(WSNAP), the ML based tabGAP potential and three embedded atom method (EAM)\nbased potentials. A total of 3500 MD simulations with the primary knock-on\natoms (PKA) having energys 5, 10, 20, 50, 75, 100 and 150 keV were carried out.\nThe PKA are launched in hundred random directions at each of the PKA energies\nto obtain statistically valid results. Analysis using CSaransh, a web based\ntool to analyze a large collision cascade database, was carried out to obtain\nthe number of defects (individual and in clusters), the defect cluster\nmorphologies, the defect cluster size distributions and the number of\nsub-cascades formed. It is seen that <1 1 1> clusters dominate across all the\ninter-atomic potentials (IAP), except for the WSNAP potential. The WSNAP\npotential shows significantly higher number of C-15 like rings across all PKA\nenergies. The WSNAP potential also shows a higher fraction of in-cluster\nvacancies.

      "abstract": "Anthropogenic influences have been linked to tropical cyclone (TC) poleward\nmigration, TC extreme precipitation, and an increased proportion of major\nhurricanes [1, 2, 3, 4]. Understanding past TC trends and variability is\ncritical for projecting future TC impacts on human society considering the\nchanging climate [5]. However, past trends of TC structure/energy remain\nuncertain due to limited observations; subjective-analyzed and\nspatiotemporal-heterogeneous \"best-track\" datasets lead to reduced confidence\nin the assessed TC repose to climate change [6, 7]. Here, we use deep learning\nto reconstruct past \"observations\" and yield an objective global TC wind\nprofile dataset during 1981 to 2020, facilitating a comprehensive examination\nof TC structure/energy. By training with uniquely labeled data integrating best\ntracks and numerical model analysis of 2004 to 2018 TCs, our model converts\nmultichannel satellite imagery to a 0-750-km wind profile of axisymmetric\nsurface winds. The model performance is verified to be sufficient for climate\nstudies by comparing it to independent satellite-radar surface winds. Based on\nthe new homogenized dataset, the major TC proportion has increased by ~13% in\nthe past four decades. Moreover, the proportion of extremely high-energy TCs\nhas increased by ~25%, along with an increasing trend (> one standard deviation\nof the 40-y variability) of the mean total energy of high-energy TCs. Although\nthe warming ocean favors TC intensification, the TC track migration to higher\nlatitudes and altered environments further affect TC structure/energy. This new\ndeep learning method/dataset reveals novel trends regarding TC structure\nextremes and may help verify simulations/studies regarding TCs in the changing\nclimate.",

Acquiring all MR\nmodalities, however, can be expensive, and, during a scanning session, certain\nMR images may be missed depending on the study protocol. The typical solution\nwould be to synthesize the missing modalities from the acquired images such as\nusing generative adversarial networks (GANs).

To address\nthis, in this work, we propose a transformer-based modality infuser designed to\nsynthesize multimodal brain MR images. In our method, we extract\nmodality-agnostic features from the encoder and then transform them into\nmodality-specific features using the modality infuser. Furthermore, the\nmodality infuser captures long-range relationships among all brain structures,\nleading to the generation of more realistic images. We carried out experiments\non the BraTS 2018 dataset, translating between four MR modalities, and our\nexperimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in\nterms of synthesis quality.

This depth $\\alpha(n)$ is the minimum possible to\nwithin an additive constant 2; we credit the nearly-matching depth lower bound\nto G\\'{a}l et al., since it directly follows their method (although not\nexplicitly claimed or fully verified in that work), and is obtained by making\nsome constants explicit in a graph-theoretic lemma of Pudl\\'{a}k\n[Combinatorica, 14(2), 1994], extending it to super-constant depths.\n  We also study a subclass of MDS codes $C: \\mathbb{F}^n \\to \\mathbb{F}^m$\ncharacterized by the Hamming-distance relation $\\mathrm{dist}(C(x), C(y)) \\ge m\n- \\mathrm{dist}(x, y) + 1$ for any distinct $x, y \\in \\mathbb{F}^n$. (For\nlinear codes this is equivalent to the generator matrix being totally\ninvertible.) We call these superconcentrator-induced codes, and we show their\ntight connection with superconcentrators. Specifically, we observe that any\nlinear or nonlinear circuit encoding a superconcentrator-induced code must be a\nsuperconcentrator graph, and any superconcentrator graph can be converted to a\nlinear circuit, over a sufficiently large field (exponential in the size of the\ngraph), encoding a superconcentrator-induced code.",

In the considered model, multiple physical devices in the\nphysical network (PN) needs to frequently offload the computation task related\ndata to the digital network twin (DNT), which is generated and controlled by\nthe central server. Due to limited energy budget of the physical devices, both\ncomputation accuracy and wireless transmission power must be considered during\nthe DT procedure.

To solve this problem, an alternating algorithm with iteratively\nsolving device scheduling, power control, and data offloading subproblems. For\nthe device scheduling subproblem, the optimal solution is obtained in closed\nform through the dual method. For the special case with one physical device,\nthe optimal number of transmission times is reveled. Based on the theoretical\nfindings, the original problem is transformed into a simplified problem and the\noptimal device scheduling can be found.

      "abstract": "In this thesis, we have studied the evolution of superconductivity in\namorphous Molybdenum Germanium ($\\textit{a}$-MoGe) thin films. The work can be\nbroken down into two parts. In the first part, we investigate the effect of\ndecreasing thickness on the suppression of superconductivity in\n$\\textit{a}$-MoGe thin films. Thick $\\textit{a}$-MoGe thin film is a typical\ntype-II superconductor and follows the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer\n(BCS) equation. Conventionally, it is believed that decreasing thickness will\ndecrease the effective attractive pairing interaction because of the gradual\nloss of screening which holds true for large thicknesses in $\\textit{a}$-MoGe.\nBut for lower thicknesses, a new mechanism comes into the picture where\nsuperfluid density is suppressed making the superconductor vulnerable to phase\nfluctuations. This is known as the Bosonic mechanism, where superconductivity\nis destroyed due to the loss of phase coherence of the superconducting state\neven though the attractive pairing amplitude remains finite above the\ntransition temperature. In the second part, we explore the electromagnetic\nresponse of vortices in $\\textit{a}$-MoGe thin film by low-frequency two-coil\nmutual inductance technique. Penetration depth measured from the two-coil\ntechnique was earlier used to determine superfluid density. However in the\npresent work, by analyzing the in-field penetration depth data with the help of\na mean-field model proposed by Coffey and Clem, we have demonstrated a\nprocedure of extraction of vortex parameters such as pinning restoring force\nconstant or Labusch parameter, vortex lattice drag coefficient and pinning\npotential barrier for the thermally activated motion of vortices. The\ntemperature variation of vortex parameters suggests the dominant effect of\nthermal fluctuations.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) hold a pivotal role in modeling event\nsequences across diverse domains, including social networking and e-commerce,\nand have significantly contributed to the advancement of recommendation systems\nand information retrieval strategies. Through the analysis of events such as\nuser interactions and transactions, TPPs offer valuable insights into\nbehavioral patterns, facilitating the prediction of future trends. However,\naccurately forecasting future events remains a formidable challenge due to the\nintricate nature of these patterns. The integration of Neural Networks with\nTPPs has ushered in the development of advanced deep TPP models. While these\nmodels excel at processing complex and nonlinear temporal data, they encounter\nlimitations in modeling intensity functions, grapple with computational\ncomplexities in integral computations, and struggle to capture long-range\ntemporal dependencies effectively. In this study, we introduce the CuFun model,\nrepresenting a novel approach to TPPs that revolves around the Cumulative\nDistribution Function (CDF). CuFun stands out by uniquely employing a monotonic\nneural network for CDF representation, utilizing past events as a scaling\nfactor. This innovation significantly bolsters the model's adaptability and\nprecision across a wide range of data scenarios. Our approach addresses several\ncritical issues inherent in traditional TPP modeling: it simplifies\nlog-likelihood calculations, extends applicability beyond predefined density\nfunction forms, and adeptly captures long-range temporal patterns. Our\ncontributions encompass the introduction of a pioneering CDF-based TPP model,\nthe development of a methodology for incorporating past event information into\nfuture event prediction, and empirical validation of CuFun's effectiveness\nthrough extensive experimentation on synthetic and real-world datasets.",

      "abstract": "The computation and memory-intensive nature of DNNs limits their use in many\nmobile and embedded contexts. Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)\nhardware accelerators employ matrix multiplication units (such as the systolic\narrays) and dedicated nonlinear function units to speed up DNN computations. A\nclose examination of these ASIC accelerators reveals that the designs are often\nspecialized and lack versatility across different networks, especially when the\nnetworks have different types of computation. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel systolic array architecture, which is capable of executing nonlinear\nfunctions. By encompassing both inherent linear and newly enabled nonlinear\nfunctions within the systolic arrays, the proposed architecture facilitates\nversatile network inferences, substantially enhancing computational power and\nenergy efficiency. Experimental results show that employing this systolic array\nenables seamless execution of entire DNNs, incurring only a negligible loss in\nthe network inference accuracy. Furthermore, assessment and evaluation with\nFPGAs reveal that integrating nonlinear computation capacity into a systolic\narray does not introduce extra notable (less than 1.5%) block memory memories\n(BRAMs), look-up-tables (LUTs), or digital signal processors (DSPs) but a mere\n13.3% - 24.1% more flip flops (FFs). In comparison to existing methodologies,\nexecuting the networks with the proposed systolic array, which enables the\nflexibility of different network models, yields up to 25.73x, 5.21x, and 1.54x\ncomputational efficiency when compared to general-purpose CPUs, GPUs, and SoCs\nrespectively, while achieving comparable (83.4% - 135.8%) performance with the\nconventional accelerators which are designed for specific neural network\nmodels.",

Recognizing this challenge, we have made a\nnoteworthy observation: traffic patterns exhibit similarities across diverse\ncities. Building on this key insight, we propose a solution for the cross-city\nfew-shot traffic forecasting problem called Multi-scale Traffic Pattern Bank\n(MTPB). Primarily, MTPB initiates its learning process by leveraging data-rich\nsource cities, effectively acquiring comprehensive traffic knowledge through a\nspatial-temporal-aware pre-training process. Subsequently, the framework\nemploys advanced clustering techniques to systematically generate a multi-scale\ntraffic pattern bank derived from the learned knowledge. Next, the traffic data\nof the data-scarce target city could query the traffic pattern bank,\nfacilitating the aggregation of meta-knowledge. This meta-knowledge, in turn,\nassumes a pivotal role as a robust guide in subsequent processes involving\ngraph reconstruction and forecasting. Empirical assessments conducted on\nreal-world traffic datasets affirm the superior performance of MTPB, surpassing\nexisting methods across various categories and exhibiting numerous attributes\nconducive to the advancement of cross-city few-shot forecasting methodologies.\nThe code is available in https://github.com/zhyliu00/MTPB.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on improving autonomous driving safety via task\noffloading from cellular vehicles (CVs), using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)\nlinks, to an multi-access edge computing (MEC) server. Considering that the\nfrequencies used for V2I links can be reused for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)\ncommunications to improve spectrum utilization, the receiver of each V2I link\nmay suffer from severe interference, causing outages in the task offloading\nprocess. To tackle this issue, we propose the deployment of a reconfigurable\nintelligent computational surface (RICS) to enable, not only V2I reflective\nlinks, but also interference cancellation at the V2V links exploiting the\ncomputational capability of its metamaterials. We devise a joint optimization\nformulation for the task offloading ratio between the CVs and the MEC server,\nthe spectrum sharing strategy between V2V and V2I communications, as well as\nthe RICS reflection and refraction matrices, with the objective to maximize a\nsafety-based autonomous driving task. Due to the non-convexity of the problem\nand the coupling among its free variables, we transform it into a more\ntractable equivalent form, which is then decomposed into three sub-problems and\nsolved via an alternate approximation method. Our simulation results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RICS optimization in improving\nthe safety in autonomous driving networks.",

      "abstract": "We address the challenge of societal bias in Large Language Models (LLMs),\nfocusing on the Llama 2 7B Chat model. As LLMs are increasingly integrated into\ndecision-making processes with substantial societal impact, it becomes\nimperative to ensure these models do not reinforce existing biases. Our\napproach employs activation steering to probe for and mitigate biases related\nto gender, race, and religion. This method manipulates model activations to\ndirect responses towards or away from biased outputs, utilizing steering\nvectors derived from the StereoSet dataset and custom GPT4 generated gender\nbias prompts. Our findings reveal inherent gender bias in Llama 2 7B Chat,\npersisting even after Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We\nalso observe a predictable negative correlation between bias and the model's\ntendency to refuse responses. Significantly, our study uncovers that RLHF tends\nto increase the similarity in the model's representation of different forms of\nsocietal biases, which raises questions about the model's nuanced understanding\nof different forms of bias. This work also provides valuable insights into\neffective red-teaming strategies for LLMs using activation steering,\nparticularly emphasizing the importance of integrating a refusal vector.",

      "abstract": "The Critical Node Problem (CNP) is concerned with identifying the critical\nnodes in a complex network. These nodes play a significant role in maintaining\nthe connectivity of the network, and removing them can negatively impact\nnetwork performance. CNP has been studied extensively due to its numerous\nreal-world applications. Among the different versions of CNP, CNP-1a has gained\nthe most popularity. The primary objective of CNP-1a is to minimize the\npair-wise connectivity in the remaining network after deleting a limited number\nof nodes from a network. Due to the NP-hard nature of CNP-1a, many\nheuristic/metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem.\nHowever, most existing algorithms start with a random initialization, leading\nto a high cost of obtaining an optimal solution. To improve the efficiency of\nsolving CNP-1a, a knowledge-guided genetic algorithm named K2GA has been\nproposed. Unlike the standard genetic algorithm framework, K2GA has two main\ncomponents: a pretrained neural network to obtain prior knowledge on possible\ncritical nodes, and a hybrid genetic algorithm with local search for finding an\noptimal set of critical nodes based on the knowledge given by the trained\nneural network. The local search process utilizes a cut node-based greedy\nstrategy. The effectiveness of the proposed knowledgeguided genetic algorithm\nis verified by experiments on 26 realworld instances of complex networks.\nExperimental results show that K2GA outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms\nregarding the best, median, and average objective values, and improves the best\nupper bounds on the best objective values for eight realworld instances.",

Also\nknown as the Sturm-Liouville problem (SLP), this paper explores the intricacies\nof this classical problem, particularly the relationship between its canonical\nand Liouville normal (Schr\\\"odinger) forms. While the conversion from canonical\nto Schr\\\"odinger form using Liouville's transformation is well-known in the\nliterature, the inverse transformation seems to be neglected. Our study\nattempts to fill this gap by investigating the inverse of Liouville's\ntransformation, that is, given any SLP in the Schr\\\"odinger form with some\ninvariant function, we seek the SLP in its canonical form. By examining closely\nthe second Paine-de Hoog-Anderson (PdHA) problem, we argue that retrieving the\nSLP to its canonical form can be notoriously difficult and even impossible to\nachieve in its exact form. Finding the inverse relationship between the two\nindependent variables seems to be the main obstacle. We confirm this claim by\nconsidering four different scenarios depending on the potential and density\nfunctions that appear in the corresponding invariant function. In the second\nPdHA problem, this invariant function takes a reciprocal quadratic binomial\nform. In some cases, the inverse Liouville's transformation produces an exact\nexpression for the SLP in its canonical form.

      "abstract": "Designing quantum systems with the measurement speed and accuracy needed for\nquantum error correction using superconducting qubits requires iterative design\nand test informed by accurate models and characterization tools. We introduce a\nsingle protocol, with few prerequisite calibrations, which measures the\ndispersive shift, resonator linewidth, and drive power used in the dispersive\nreadout of superconducting qubits. We find that the resonator linewidth is\npoorly controlled with a factor of 2 between the maximum and minimum measured\nvalues, and is likely to require focused attention in future quantum error\ncorrection experiments. We also introduce a protocol for measuring the readout\nsystem efficiency using the same power levels as are used in typical qubit\nreadout, and without the need to measure the qubit coherence. We routinely run\nthese protocols on chips with tens of qubits, driven by automation software\nwith little human interaction. Using the extracted system parameters, we find\nthat a model based on those parameters predicts the readout signal to noise\nratio to within 10% over a device with 54 qubits.",

The paper\ndeals with the application of a rigid-perfectly plastic two-phase model\nextended by the Drucker-Prager yield criterion to simulate granular media with\na finite volume flow solver (FV). The model refers to the combination of a\nBingham fluid and an Eulerian strain measure to assess the failure region of\ngranular dam slides. A monolithic volume-of-fluid (VoF) method is used to\ndistinguish between the air and granular phases, both governed by the\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The numerical framework enables\nmodeling of large displacements and arbitrary shapes for large-scale\napplications. The displayed validation and verification focuses on the\nrigid-perfectly plastic material model for non-cohesive and cohesive materials\nwith varying angles of repose.

This study presents, for the first time, an exhaustive review\nof the transferability aspect of adversarial attacks. It systematically\ncategorizes and critically evaluates various methodologies developed to augment\nthe transferability of adversarial attacks. This study encompasses a spectrum\nof techniques, including Generative Structure, Semantic Similarity, Gradient\nEditing, Target Modification, and Ensemble Approach. Concurrently, this paper\nintroduces a benchmark framework \\textit{TAA-Bench}, integrating ten leading\nmethodologies for adversarial attack transferability, thereby providing a\nstandardized and systematic platform for comparative analysis across diverse\nmodel architectures. Through comprehensive scrutiny, we delineate the efficacy\nand constraints of each method, shedding light on their underlying operational\nprinciples and practical utility. This review endeavors to be a quintessential\nresource for both scholars and practitioners in the field, charting the complex\nterrain of adversarial transferability and setting a foundation for future\nexplorations in this vital sector.

      "abstract": "Recently, there have been tremendous efforts in developing lightweight Deep\nNeural Networks (DNNs) with satisfactory accuracy, which can enable the\nubiquitous deployment of DNNs in edge devices. The core challenge of developing\ncompact and efficient DNNs lies in how to balance the competing goals of\nachieving high accuracy and high efficiency. In this paper we propose two novel\ntypes of convolutions, dubbed \\emph{Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) and\nBinary PDC (Bi-PDC)} which enjoy the following benefits: capturing higher-order\nlocal differential information, computationally efficient, and able to be\nintegrated with existing DNNs. With PDC and Bi-PDC, we further present two\nlightweight deep networks named \\emph{Pixel Difference Networks (PiDiNet)} and\n\\emph{Binary PiDiNet (Bi-PiDiNet)} respectively to learn highly efficient yet\nmore accurate representations for visual tasks including edge detection and\nobject recognition. Extensive experiments on popular datasets (BSDS500,\nImageNet, LFW, YTF, \\emph{etc.}) show that PiDiNet and Bi-PiDiNet achieve the\nbest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. For edge detection, PiDiNet is the first\nnetwork that can be trained without ImageNet, and can achieve the human-level\nperformance on BSDS500 at 100 FPS and with $<$1M parameters. For object\nrecognition, among existing Binary DNNs, Bi-PiDiNet achieves the best accuracy\nand a nearly $2\\times$ reduction of computational cost on ResNet18.

Our aim is to study\nclassical and quantum dynamics for the corresponding Landau Hamiltonian. It\nturns out that the results depend strongly on the chosen gauge. For the Landau\ngauge the position observable is unbounded for \"almost all\" non resonant\nfrequencies $\\omega$. On the contrary, for the symmetric gauge we obtain that,\nfor \"almost all\" non resonant frequencies $\\omega$, the Landau Hamiltonian is\nreducible to a two dimensional harmonic oscillator and thus gives rise to\nbounded dynamics. The proofs use KAM algorithms for the classical dynamics.\nQuantum applications are given.

In particular, they encode how physical properties like,\ne.g., charge, energy, momentum, and pressure are spatially distributed. While\nnucleon electromagnetic form factors have been studied for a long time, the\nfirst extraction of nucleon gravitational form factors from experimental data\nwas reported in 2018, triggering a lot of enthusiasm and attention in the\nhadronic community. In this contribution we review some theoretical bases,\ndiscuss recent developments regarding the physical interpretation of these form\nfactors, and give a glimpse of what can be learned about the mass and spin\nstructure of the nucleon.",

      "abstract": "Rigorous implementation of the effects of collisions in modeling the\nformation of the polarized solar lines is of utmost importance in order to\nrealistically analyze the available, highly sensitive solar spectropolarimetric\nobservations. Indeed, even when an observation seems to fit well with theory,\none can misinterpret results if important effects due to collisions are not\ncorrectly implemented in the modeling process. We point out inconsistencies in\nthe models adopted to implement the Paschen Back effect together with\ncollisional effects on the solar linear polarization formed by scattering of\nanisotropic radiation. Because the significance of these inconsistencies\nincreases as polarization becomes increasingly responsive to collisions, we\ninvestigate the range of hydrogen densities $n_\\text{H}$ to which the\npolarization is sensitive. We used the density matrix formalism in the\ntensorial irreducible basis, which was developed within the theory of\natom-radiation interaction and of atomic collisions. We solved the statistical\nequilibrium equations for multi-level atoms with hyperfine structure (HFS) in\norder to evaluate the collisional depolarization of levels of the D1-D2 lines\nof the K I atom. We find that collisions play a prominent role, particularly at\nhydrogen densities of between 10$^{13}$ and 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$. So far,\nanalyses of polarized lines formed in the presence of solar magnetic field have\nincorporated, if at all, collisional rates calculated assuming zero magnetic\nfield. This could be a good approximation in the Hanle regime but not in the\nPaschen Back regime. For typical quiet Sun magnetic fields, the latter regime\ncould be reached, and level-crossing takes place in several atomic systems.\nTherefore, one must be careful when using collisional rates calculated in the\nzero-field case to interpret linear polarization formed in magnetized media.",

      "abstract": "Due to the data imbalance and the diversity of defects, student-teacher\nnetworks (S-T) are favored in unsupervised anomaly detection, which explores\nthe discrepancy in feature representation derived from the knowledge\ndistillation process to recognize anomalies. However, vanilla S-T network is\nnot stable. Employing identical structures to construct the S-T network may\nweaken the representative discrepancy on anomalies. But using different\nstructures can increase the likelihood of divergent performance on normal data.\nTo address this problem, we propose a novel dual-student knowledge distillation\n(DSKD) architecture. Different from other S-T networks, we use two student\nnetworks a single pre-trained teacher network, where the students have the same\nscale but inverted structures. This framework can enhance the distillation\neffect to improve the consistency in recognition of normal data, and\nsimultaneously introduce diversity for anomaly representation. To explore\nhigh-dimensional semantic information to capture anomaly clues, we employ two\nstrategies. First, a pyramid matching mode is used to perform knowledge\ndistillation on multi-scale feature maps in the intermediate layers of\nnetworks. Second, an interaction is facilitated between the two student\nnetworks through a deep feature embedding module, which is inspired by\nreal-world group discussions. In terms of classification, we obtain pixel-wise\nanomaly segmentation maps by measuring the discrepancy between the output\nfeature maps of the teacher and student networks, from which an anomaly score\nis computed for sample-wise determination. We evaluate DSKD on three benchmark\ndatasets and probe the effects of internal modules through ablation\nexperiments. The results demonstrate that DSKD can achieve exceptional\nperformance on small models like ResNet18 and effectively improve vanilla S-T\nnetworks.",

      "abstract": "Programs must be correct with respect to their application domain. Yet, the\nprogram specification and verification approaches so far only consider\ncorrectness in terms of computations. In this work, we present a two-tier Hoare\nLogic that integrates assertions for both implementation and domain. For domain\nspecification, we use description logics and semantic lifting, a recently\nproposed approach to interpret a program as a knowledge graph. We present a\ncalculus that uses translations between both kinds of assertions, thus\nseparating the concerns in specification, but enabling the use of description\nlogic in verification.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, social planners have used crowdfunding to raise funds for\npublic projects. As these public projects are non-excludable, the beneficiaries\nmay free-ride. Thus, there is a need to design incentive mechanisms for such\nstrategic agents to contribute to the project. The existing mechanisms, like\nPPR or PPRx, assume that the agent's beliefs about the project getting funded\ndo not change over time, i.e., their beliefs are static. Researchers highlight\nthat unless appropriately incentivized, the agents defer their contributions in\nstatic settings, leading to a ``race'' to contribute at the deadline. In this\nwork, we model the evolution of agents' beliefs as a random walk. We study PPRx\n-- an existing mechanism for the static belief setting -- in this dynamic\nbelief setting and refer to it as PPRx-DB for readability. We prove that in\nPPRx-DB, the project is funded at equilibrium. More significantly, we prove\nthat under certain conditions on agent's belief evolution, agents will\ncontribute as soon as they arrive at the mechanism. Thus, we believe that by\nincorporating dynamic belief evolution in analysis, the social planner can\nmitigate the concern of race conditions in many mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "The monogamy property of entanglement is an intriguing feature of\nmultipartite quantum entanglement. Most entanglement measures satisfying the\nmonogamy inequality are turned out to be convex. Whether nonconvex entanglement\nmeasures obeys the monogamy inequalities remains less known at present. As a\nwell known measure of entanglement, the logarithmic negativity is not convex.\nWe elucidate the constraints of multi-qubit entanglement based on the\nlogarithmic convex-roof extended negativity (LCREN) and the logarithmic\nconvex-roof extended negativity of assistance (LCRENoA). Using the Hamming\nweight derived from the binary vector associated with the distribution of\nsubsystems, we establish monogamy inequalities for multi-qubit entanglement in\nterms of the $\\alpha$th-power ($\\alpha\\geq 4\\ln2$) of LCREN, and polygamy\ninequalities utilizing the $\\alpha$th-power ($0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 2$) of\nLCRENoA. We demonstrate that these inequalities give rise to tighter\nconstraints than the existing ones. Furthermore, our monogamy inequalities are\nshown to remain valid for the high dimensional states that violate the CKW\nmonogamy inequality. Detailed examples are presented to illustrate the\neffectiveness of our results in characterizing the multipartite entanglement\ndistributions.",

In this project,\nExB poloidal flows are implemented in a classical l=2 stellarator\nconfiguration, by imposing a simple radial electric potential profile via\ninitial conditions. The influence of this sheared background flow velocity on\npressure-driven modes is interrogated, demonstrating a stabilizing effect when\nthe shearing rate is comparable to the growth rate. This effect is observed for\nmultiple toroidal modes and at different viscosities, demonstrating that the\nstabilization occurs as a result of shear decorrelation. Oscillations of the\nlinear growth rate are observed in cases with higher flow speeds; this\nphenomenon is hypothesized to be due to phase misalignment between the\npoloidally coupled modes contributing to the ballooning mode.

      "abstract": "This letter presents a non-local study on the electric field tunable edge\ntransport in an hBN-encapsulated dual-gated Bernal stacked (ABA) trilayer\ngraphene across various displacement fields ($D$) and temperatures ($T$). Our\nmeasurements revealed that the non-local resistance ($R_{NL}$) surpassed the\nexpected classical ohmic contribution by a factor of at least two orders of\nmagnitude. Through scaling analysis, we found that the non-local resistance\nscales linearly with the local resistance ($R_{L}$) only when the $D$ exceeds a\ncritical value of $\\sim0.2$ V/nm. Additionally, we observed that the scaling\nexponent remains constant at unity for temperatures below the bulk-band gap\nenergy threshold ($T<25$ K). Further, the value of $R_{NL}$ decreases in a\nlinear fashion as the channel length ($L$) increases. These experimental\nfindings provide evidence for edge-mediated charge transport in ABA trilayer\ngraphene under the influence of a finite displacement field. Furthermore, our\ntheoretical calculations support these results by demonstrating the emergence\nof dispersive edge modes within the bulk-band gap energy range when a\nsufficient displacement field is applied.",

      "abstract": "Online harms, such as hate speech, misinformation, harassment and self-harm\npromotion, continue to be widespread. While some work suggests that women are\ndisproportionately affected by such harms, other studies find little evidence\nfor gender differences in overall exposure. Here, we present preliminary\nresults from a large, nationally representative survey of UK adults (N = 2000).\nWe asked about exposure to 15 specific harms, along with fears surrounding\nexposure and comfort engaging in certain online behaviours. While men and women\nreport seeing online harms to a roughly equal extent overall, we find that\nwomen are significantly more fearful of experiencing every type of harm that we\nasked about, and are significantly less comfortable partaking in several online\nbehaviours. Strikingly, just 24% of women report being comfortable expressing\npolitical opinions online compared with almost 40% of men, with similar overall\nproportions for challenging certain content. Our work suggests that women may\nsuffer an additional psychological burden in response to the proliferation of\nharmful online content, doing more 'safety work' to protect themselves. With\nmuch public discourse happening online, gender inequality in public voice is\nlikely to be perpetuated if women feel too fearful to participate. Our results\nare important because to establish greater equality in society, we must take\nmeasures to ensure all members feel safe and able to participate in the online\nspace.",

      "abstract": "A novel coding design is proposed to enhance information retrieval in a\nwireless network of users with partial access to the data, in the sense of\nobservation, measurement, computation, or storage. Information exchange in the\nnetwork is assisted by a multi-antenna base station (BS), with no direct access\nto the data. Accordingly, the missing parts of data are exchanged among users\nthrough an uplink (UL) step followed by a downlink (DL) step. In this paper,\nnew coding strategies, inspired by coded caching (CC) techniques, are devised\nto enhance both UL and DL steps. In the UL step, users transmit encoded and\nproperly combined parts of their accessible data to the BS. Then, during the DL\nstep, the BS carries out the required processing on its received signals and\nforwards a proper combination of the resulting signal terms back to the users,\nenabling each user to retrieve the desired information. Using the devised coded\ndata retrieval strategy, the data exchange in both UL and DL steps requires the\nsame communication delay, measured by normalized delivery time (NDT).\nFurthermore, the NDT of the UL/DL step is shown to coincide with the optimal\nNDT of the original DL multi-input single-output CC scheme, in which the BS is\nconnected to a centralized data library.",

The communication overhead, a\ncritical factor affecting the execution fidelity of quantum circuits, arises\nfrom inevitable qubit routing that brings interacting qubits into physical\nproximity by the means of serial SWAP gates to enable the direct two-qubit gate\napplication. Characterizing the qubit movement across the processor is crucial\nfor tailoring techniques for minimizing the SWAP gates. This work presents a\ncomparative analysis of the resulting communication overhead among three\nprocessor topologies: star, heavy-hexagon lattice, and square lattice\ntopologies, according to performance metrics of communication-to-computation\nratio, mean qubit hotspotness, and temporal burstiness, showcasing that the\nsquare lattice layout is favourable for quantum computer architectures at a\nscale.",

      "abstract": "Starting from a classical thermodynamic approach, we derive rate-type\nequations to describe the behavior of heat flow in deformable media.\nConstitutive equations are defined in the material (Lagrangian) description\nwhere the standard time derivative satisfies the principle of objectivity. The\nstatement of the Second Law is formulated in the classical form and the\nthermodynamic restrictions are then developed following the Coleman-Noll\nprocedure. However, instead of the Clausius Duhem inequality we consider the\ncorresponding equality where the entropy production rate is prescribed by a\nnon-negative constitutive function. Both the free energy and the entropy\nproduction are assumed to depend on a common set of independent variables\ninvolving, in addition to temperature, both temperature gradient and heat-flux\nvector together with their time derivatives. This approach results in rate-type\nconstitutive equations for the heat-flux vector that are intrinsically\nconsistent with the Second Law and easily amenable to analysis. In addition to\nobtaining already known models (e.g. Cattaneo-Maxwell's, Jeffreys-like and\nGreen-Naghdi's heat conductors), this scheme allows us to build new and more\ncomplex models of heat transport that may have applications in describing the\nthermal behavior in nanosystems. Indeed, when higher order time derivatives of\nthe heat flux vector are involved, many different relaxation times occur within\nthe rate equation.",

In this study, we present SA-MDKIF, a scalable and adaptable\nframework that aims to inject medical knowledge into general-purpose LLMs\nthrough instruction tuning, thereby enabling adaptability for various\ndownstream tasks. SA-MDKIF consists of two stages: skill training and skill\nadaptation. In the first stage, we define 12 basic medical skills and use\nAdaLoRA to train these skills based on uniformly formatted instructional\ndatasets that we have constructed. In the next stage, we train the skill router\nusing task-specific downstream data and use this router to integrate the\nacquired skills with LLMs during inference. Experimental results on 9 different\nmedical tasks show that SA-MDKIF improves performance by 10-20% compared to the\noriginal LLMs. Notably, this improvement is particularly pronounced for unseen\nmedical tasks, showing an improvement of up to 30%.",

      "abstract": "We consider the communication of natural language text from a source to a\ndestination over noiseless and character-erasure channels. We exploit\nlanguage's inherent correlations and predictability to constrain transmission\ncosts by allowing the destination to predict or complete words with potential\ndissimilarity with the source text. Concretely, our objective is to obtain\nachievable $(\\bar{c}, \\bar{s})$ pairs, where $\\bar{c}$ is the average\ntransmission cost at the source and $\\bar{s}$ is the average semantic\nsimilarity measured via cosine similarity between vector embedding of words at\nthe source and those predicted/completed at the destination. We obtain\n$(\\bar{c}, \\bar{s})$ pairs for neural language and first-order Markov\nchain-based small language models (SLM) for prediction, using both a threshold\npolicy that transmits a word if its cosine similarity with that\npredicted/completed at the destination is below a threshold, and a periodic\npolicy, which transmits words after a specific interval and predicts/completes\nthe words in between, at the destination. We adopt an SLM for word completion.\nWe demonstrate that, when communication occurs over a noiseless channel, the\nthreshold policy achieves a higher $\\bar{s}$ for a given $\\bar{c}$ than the\nperiodic policy and that the $\\bar{s}$ achieved with the neural SLM is greater\nthan or equal to that of the Markov chain-based algorithm for the same\n$\\bar{c}$. The improved performance comes with a higher complexity in terms of\ntime and computing requirements. However, when communication occurs over a\ncharacter-erasure channel, all prediction algorithms and scheduling policies\nperform poorly. Furthermore, if character-level Huffman coding is used, the\nrequired $\\bar{c}$ to achieve a given $\\bar{s}$ is reduced, but the above\nobservations still apply.",

The SAA is an effective paradigm to address risks and\nuncertainty in stochastic models from the perspective of Monte Carlo principle.\nNonetheless, a numerical conflict arises from the sample size of SAA when one\nhas to make a tradeoff between the accuracy of solutions and the computational\ncost. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate a gradually reinforced SAA scheme\ninto a differentiable homotopy method and develop a gradually reinforced\nsample-average-approximation (GRSAA) differentiable homotopy method in this\npaper. By introducing a series of continuously differentiable functions of the\nhomotopy parameter $t$ ranging between zero and one, we establish a\ndifferentiable homotopy system, which is able to gradually increase the sample\nsize of SAA as $t$ descends from one to zero. The set of solutions to the\nhomotopy system contains an everywhere smooth path, which starts from an\narbitrary point and ends at a solution to the SAA with any desired accuracy.\nThe GRSAA differentiable homotopy method serves as a bridge to link the\ngradually reinforced SAA scheme and a differentiable homotopy method and\nretains the nice property of global convergence the homotopy method possesses\nwhile greatly reducing the computational cost for attaining a desired solution\nto the original SSE.

      "abstract": "High-quality control is a fundamental requirement for quantum computation,\nbut practically it is often hampered by the presence of various types of\nnoises, which can be static or time-dependent. In many realistic scenarios,\nmultiple noise sources coexist, and their resulting noise effects need be\ncorrected to a sufficient order, posing significant challenges for the design\nof effective robust control methods. Here, we explore the method of robust\nquantum optimal control to generally tackle the problem of resisting multiple\nnoises from a complicated noise environment. Specifically, we confine our\nanalysis to unitary noises that can be described by classical noise models.\nThis method employs a gradient-based multiobjective optimization algorithm to\nmaximize the control figure of merit, and meanwhile to minimize the\nperturbative effects of the noises that are allowed for. To verify its\neffectiveness, we apply this method to a number of examples, including roubust\nentangling gate in trapped ion system and robust controlled-Z gate in\nsuperconducting qubits, under commonly encountered static and time-dependent\nnoises. Our simulation results reveal that robust optimal control can find\nsmooth, robust pulses that can simultaneously resist several noises and thus\nachieve high-fidelity gates.

      "abstract": "Existing auto-encoder (AE)-based channel state information (CSI) frameworks\nhave focused on a specific configuration of user equipment (UE) and base\nstation (BS), and thus the input and output sizes of the AE are fixed. However,\nin the real-world scenario, the input and output sizes may vary depending on\nthe number of antennas of the BS and UE and the allocated resource block in the\nfrequency dimension. A naive approach to support the different input and output\nsizes is to use multiple AE models, which is impractical for the UE due to the\nlimited HW resources. In this paper, we propose a universal AE framework that\ncan support different input sizes and multiple compression ratios. The proposed\nAE framework significantly reduces the HW complexity while providing comparable\nperformance in terms of compression ratio-distortion trade-off compared to the\nnaive and state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Hex-dominant mesh generation has received significant attention in recent\nresearch due to its superior robustness compared to pure hex-mesh generation\ntechniques. In this work, we introduce the first structure for analyzing\nhex-dominant meshes. This structure builds on the base complex of pure\nhex-meshes but incorporates the non-hex elements for a more comprehensive and\ncomplete representation. We provide its definition and describe its\nconstruction steps. Based on this structure, we present an extraction and\ncategorization of sheets using advanced graph matching techniques to handle the\nnon-hex elements. This enables us to develop an enhanced visual analysis of the\nstructure for any hex-dominant meshes.We apply this structure-based visual\nanalysis to compare hex-dominant meshes generated by different methods to study\ntheir advantages and disadvantages. This complements the standard quality\nmetric based on the non-hex element percentage for hex-dominant meshes.\nMoreover, we propose a strategy to extract a cleaned (optimized) valence-based\nsingularity graph wireframe to analyze the structure for both mesh and sheets.\nOur results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid base complex provides a coarse\nrepresentation for mesh element, and the proposed valence singularity graph\nwireframe provides a better internal visualization of hex-dominant meshes.",

A thorough\ninvestigation of the shock deformation of powder materials is of great\nengineering significance. Here we combine nonequilibrium molecular dynamics\n(NEMD) simulations and X-ray diffraction (XRD) simulation methods to\ninvestigate the deformation twinning and pore compaction in shock-compressed\nnp-Mg. Significant anisotropy and strong dependence on crystallographic\norientation are presented during shock-induced deformation twinning. During the\nshock stage, three typical types of twins were firstly induced, namely {11-21}\ntwin (T1), {11-22} twin (T2) and {10-12} twin (T3). Most of them were generated\nin grains with a larger angle between the impact direction and the c-axis of\nthe lattice. With the increase in strain rate, the types and quantities of\ntwins continued to enrich, but they did not occur when the strain rate was too\nhigh. We also discussed the deformation mechanisms of the three types of twins\nand found that the coupling of slip and shuffle dominated twin deformation. In\naddition, void filling occurred due to the interaction of twinning and other\nplastic deformations, leading to the densification of np-Mg. During the release\nstage, an interesting reverse change was observed, where the twins produced by\nthe impact receded, and twins were produced in grains that were previously\ndifficult to produce.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, embedded multi-label feature selection methods,\nincorporating the search for feature subsets into model optimization, have\nattracted considerable attention in accurately evaluating the importance of\nfeatures in multi-label classification tasks. Nevertheless, the\nstate-of-the-art embedded multi-label feature selection algorithms based on\nleast square regression usually cannot preserve sufficient discriminative\ninformation in multi-label data. To tackle the aforementioned challenge, a\nnovel embedded multi-label feature selection method, termed global redundancy\nand relevance optimization in orthogonal regression (GRROOR), is proposed to\nfacilitate the multi-label feature selection. The method employs orthogonal\nregression with feature weighting to retain sufficient statistical and\nstructural information related to local label correlations of the multi-label\ndata in the feature learning process. Additionally, both global feature\nredundancy and global label relevancy information have been considered in the\northogonal regression model, which could contribute to the search for\ndiscriminative and non-redundant feature subsets in the multi-label data. The\ncost function of GRROOR is an unbalanced orthogonal Procrustes problem on the\nStiefel manifold. A simple yet effective scheme is utilized to obtain an\noptimal solution. Extensive experimental results on ten multi-label data sets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of GRROOR.",

These\npossibilities are important because they challenge the viability of WIMP DM in\nlight of tight constraints from experiments such as direct detection. We begin\nby analyzing a fermion dark matter possibility with an axion-like particle\n(ALP) portal. We consider theoretical and experimental limits related to\nneutrino and ALP data within a certain mass range, and we find the allowed\nparameter space. This possibility resolves the problem of the lack of direct\ndetection of WIMP DM through the ALP portal. Furthermore, we examine the limits\non photon signals from HESS and Fermi-LAT data. Next, we look at a\ntwo-component scalar and fermion dark matter possibility, following a similar\napproach to our previous work. This simple possibility requires only a few\nadditional fields and symmetries to explain neutrino mass and dark matter\ncandidates. By finding parameter space that satisfies various bounds, such as\nrelic density, direct detection, and invisible Higgs width, we show that both\nscalar and fermion particles can serve as DM. This possibility is consistent\nand offers a rich spectrum of phenomenology that can be tested through\ncollider-based experiments. In our final work, we removie the extra Z2 symmetry\nand added a new pseudoscalar particle in our two compoent model. We test this\npseudoscalar particle against multiple DM and non-DM related bounds, including\nDM lifetime bound, Planck bound, direct-detection limits from various target\nmaterials, and invisible Higgs width. The possibility exhibits a significant\nparameter space for our pseudoscalar DM while being in agreement with\ntheoretical and experimental limits.",

(2021) defend the idea that the ambiguity\nof the term \"explanation\" in explainable AI (XAI) can be solved by adopting any\nof four different extant accounts of explanation in the philosophy of science:\nthe Deductive Nomological, Inductive Statistical, Causal Mechanical, and New\nMechanist models. In this chapter, I show that the authors' claim that these\naccounts can be applied to deep neural networks as they would to any natural\nphenomenon is mistaken. I also provide a more general argument as to why the\nnotion of explainability as it is currently used in the XAI literature bears\nlittle resemblance to the traditional concept of scientific explanation. It\nwould be more fruitful to use the label \"understandable AI\" to avoid the\nconfusion that surrounds the goal and purposes of XAI. In the second half of\nthe chapter, I argue for a pragmatic conception of understanding that is better\nsuited to play the central role attributed to explanation in XAI.

Importantly, our proposed CS term\ncharacterization and two-particle WZ term mechanism provide a unique\nperspective to design TOTIs (TOTSCs) in terms of minimal ingredients, feasibly\nguiding the search for underlying materials, with promising candidates being\ndiscussed. This work shall advance both the theoretical and experimental\nresearch for highest-order topological matters.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for solving\nmanagement problems including inventory management, dynamic pricing, and\nrecommendation. This DRL approach has the potential to lead to a large\nmanagement model based on certain transformer neural network structures,\nresulting in an artificial general intelligence paradigm for various management\ntasks. Traditional methods have limitations for solving complex real-world\nproblems, and we demonstrate how DRL can surpass existing heuristic approaches\nfor solving management tasks. We aim to solve the problems in a unified\nframework, considering the interconnections between different tasks. Central to\nour methodology is the development of a foundational decision model\ncoordinating decisions across the different domains through generative\ndecision-making. Our experimental results affirm the effectiveness of our\nDRL-based framework in complex and dynamic business environments.

We further propose a variational framework where the encoded\nlogical constraint is expressed as a distributional loss that is compatible\nwith the model's original training loss.

      "abstract": "Graph Partitioning is widely used in many real-world applications such as\nfraud detection and social network analysis, in order to enable the distributed\ngraph computing on large graphs. However, existing works fail to balance the\ncomputation cost and communication cost on machines with different power\n(including computing capability, network bandwidth and memory size), as they\nonly consider replication factor and neglect the difference of machines in\nrealistic data centers. In this paper, we propose a general graph partitioning\nalgorithm WindGP, which can support fast and high-quality edge partitioning on\nheterogeneous machines. WindGP designs novel preprocessing techniques to\nsimplify the metric and balance the computation cost according to the\ncharacteristics of graphs and machines. Also, best-first search is proposed\ninstead of BFS and DFS, in order to generate clusters with high cohesion.\nFurthermore, WindGP adaptively tunes the partition results by sophisticated\nlocal search methods. Extensive experiments show that WindGP outperforms all\nstate-of-the-art partition methods by 1.35 - 27 times on both dense and sparse\ndistributed graph algorithms, and has good scalability with graph size and\nmachine number.",

Presently, two dominant paradigms for\ncollecting tuning data are natural-instruct (human-written) and self-instruct\n(automatically generated). Natural-instruct includes diverse and correct codes\nbut lacks instruction-code pairs, and exists improper code formats like nested\nsingle-line codes. In contrast, self-instruct automatically generates proper\npaired data. However, it suffers from low diversity due to generating\nduplicates and cannot ensure the correctness of codes. To bridge the both\nparadigms, we propose \\textbf{Semi-Instruct}. It first converts diverse but\nimproper codes from natural-instruct into proper instruction-code pairs through\na method similar to self-instruct. To verify the correctness of generated\ncodes, we design a novel way to construct test cases by generating cases'\ninputs and executing correct codes from natural-instruct to get outputs.\nFinally, diverse and correct instruction-code pairs are retained for\ninstruction tuning.

      "abstract": "Ultra-densely deploying access points (APs) to support the increasing data\ntraffic would significantly escalate the cell-edge problem resulting from\ntraditional cellular networks. By removing the cell boundaries and coordinating\nall APs for joint transmission, the cell-edge problem can be alleviated, which\nin turn leads to unaffordable system complexity and channel measurement\noverhead. A new scalable clustered cell-free network architecture has been\nproposed recently, under which the large-scale network is flexibly partitioned\ninto a set of independent subnetworks operating parallelly. In this paper, we\nstudy the energy-efficient clustered cell-free networking problem with AP\nselection. Specifically, we propose a user-centric ratio-fixed AP-selection\nbased clustering (UCR-ApSel) algorithm to form subnetworks dynamically.\nFollowing this, we analyze the average energy efficiency achieved with the\nproposed UCR-ApSel scheme theoretically and derive an effective closed-form\nupper-bound. Based on the analytical upper-bound expression, the optimal\nAP-selection ratio that maximizes the average energy efficiency is further\nderived as a simple explicit function of the total number of APs and the number\nof subnetworks. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived\noptimal AP-selection ratio and show that the proposed UCR-ApSel algorithm with\nthe optimal AP-selection ratio achieves around 40% higher energy efficiency\nthan the baselines. The analysis provides important insights to the design and\noptimization of future ultra-dense wireless communication systems.",

However, optimizing polarization control requires\ncontinuous improvements in areas such as dynamic tunability, materials, and\nefficiency. In this work, we propose a borophene-based structure capable of\nconverting linearly polarized light into arbitrarily polarized light through\nthe coherent excitation of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in optical\ncommunication band. Furthermore, a double-layer borophene structure can be\nachieved by placing a second borophene array at the top of the first one with a\n90{\\deg} relative rotation of their crystalline plane. The rotation direction\nof the polarization state of the reflected light can be switched by\nindependently controlling the carrier concentration of the two-layer borophene.\nFinally, a dipole source is used to realize the emission of polarized light,\nwhich is two orders of magnitude higher than the emission rate in free space,\nand the polarization state can be dynamically controlled by manipulating the\ncarrier concentration. Our study is simple and compact, with potential\napplications in the fields of polarizers, polarization detectors, and quantum\nemitters.",

The derived force terms\nallow evaluating bulk streaming with high-order harmonics at GHz and provide an\nexact expression compared to the existing empirical formulas. Numerical results\nshow that the contribution of higher-order harmonics increases the streaming\nflow velocity by more than 20%. We show that the expression introduced by\nNyborg should be avoided in numerical computations as it includes part of the\nacoustic radiation force that does not lead to acoustic streaming.",

      "abstract": "In representation learning, a disentangled representation is highly desirable\nas it encodes generative factors of data in a separable and compact pattern.\nResearchers have advocated leveraging disentangled representations to complete\ndownstream tasks with encouraging empirical evidence. This paper further\ninvestigates the necessity of disentangled representation in downstream\napplications. Specifically, we show that dimension-wise disentangled\nrepresentations are unnecessary on a fundamental downstream task, abstract\nvisual reasoning. We provide extensive empirical evidence against the necessity\nof disentanglement, covering multiple datasets, representation learning\nmethods, and downstream network architectures. Furthermore, our findings\nsuggest that the informativeness of representations is a better indicator of\ndownstream performance than disentanglement. Finally, the positive correlation\nbetween informativeness and disentanglement explains the claimed usefulness of\ndisentangled representations in previous works.

      "abstract": "The multi-modality and stochastic characteristics of human behavior make\nmotion prediction a highly challenging task, which is critical for autonomous\ndriving. While deep learning approaches have demonstrated their great potential\nin this area, it still remains unsolved to establish a connection between\nmultiple driving scenes (e.g., merging, roundabout, intersection) and the\ndesign of deep learning models. Current learning-based methods typically use\none unified model to predict trajectories in different scenarios, which may\nresult in sub-optimal results for one individual scene. To address this issue,\nwe propose Multi-Scenes Network (aka. MS-Net), which is a multi-path sparse\nmodel trained by an evolutionary process. MS-Net selectively activates a subset\nof its parameters during the inference stage to produce prediction results for\neach scene. In the training stage, the motion prediction task under\ndifferentiated scenes is abstracted as a multi-task learning problem, an\nevolutionary algorithm is designed to encourage the network search of the\noptimal parameters for each scene while sharing common knowledge between\ndifferent scenes. Our experiment results show that with substantially reduced\nparameters, MS-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on\nwell-established pedestrian motion prediction datasets, e.g., ETH and UCY, and\nranks the 2nd place on the INTERACTION challenge.",

In\nthese proofs, we utilize properties of the game trajectories given by very\nelementary game strategies and consider reachability of each player.

      "abstract": "Regular physical activity is crucial for reducing the risk of\nnon-communicable disease (NCD). With NCDs on the rise globally, there is an\nurgent need for effective health interventions, with chatbots emerging as a\nviable and cost-effective option because of limited healthcare accessibility.\nAlthough health professionals often utilize behavior change techniques (BCTs)\nto boost physical activity levels and enhance client engagement and motivation\nby affiliative humor, the efficacy of humor in chatbot-delivered interventions\nis not well-understood. This study conducted a randomized controlled trial to\nexamine the impact of the generative humorous communication style in a 10-day\nchatbot-delivered intervention for physical activity. It further investigated\nif user engagement and motivation act as mediators between the communication\nstyle and changes in physical activity levels. 66 participants engaged with the\nchatbots across three groups (humorous, non-humorous, and no-intervention) and\nresponded to daily ecological momentary assessment questionnaires assessing\nengagement, motivation, and physical activity levels. Multilevel time series\nanalyses revealed that an affiliative humorous communication style positively\nimpacted physical activity levels over time, with user engagement acting as a\nmediator in this relationship, whereas motivation did not. These findings\nclarify the role of humorous communication style in chatbot-delivered physical\nactivity interventions, offering valuable insights for future development of\nintelligent conversational agents incorporating humor.",

However, the correlation is\nnegative and significant only for epochs of high arousal, while positive but\nnon-significant relationships were found for epochs of medium or low arousal.\nThe average time lag for the relationship between arousal and pupil diameter\nwas 2.8 ms.

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithm by combining the clustering algorithm with QACO\nalgorithm, so that this extended QACO can handle large-scale optimization\nproblems, which makes the practical application of QACO based on available\nquantum computation resource possible. To verify the effectiveness and\nperformance of the algorithm, we tested the developed QACO algorithm with the\nTravelling Salesman Problem (TSP) as benchmarks. The developed QACO algorithm\nshows better performance under multiple data set. In addition, the developed\nQACO algorithm also manifests the robustness to noise of calculation process,\nwhich is typically a major barrier for practical application of quantum\ncomputers. Our work shows that the combination of the clustering algorithm with\nQACO has effectively extended the application scenario of QACO in current NISQ\nera of quantum computing.",

      "abstract": "Providing personalized recommendations for insurance products is particularly\nchallenging due to the intrinsic and distinctive features of the insurance\ndomain. First, unlike more traditional domains like retail, movie etc., a large\namount of user feedback is not available and the item catalog is smaller.\nSecond, due to the higher complexity of products, the majority of users still\nprefer to complete their purchases over the phone instead of online. We present\ndifferent recommender models to address such data scarcity in the insurance\ndomain. We use recurrent neural networks with 3 different types of loss\nfunctions and architectures (cross-entropy, censored Weibull, attention). Our\nmodels cope with data scarcity by learning from multiple sessions and different\ntypes of user actions. Moreover, differently from previous session-based\nmodels, our models learn to predict a target action that does not happen within\nthe session. Our models outperform state-of-the-art baselines on a real-world\ninsurance dataset, with ca. 44K users, 16 items, 54K purchases and 117K\nsessions. Moreover, combining our models with demographic data boosts the\nperformance. Analysis shows that considering multiple sessions and several\ntypes of actions are both beneficial for the models, and that our models are\nnot unfair with respect to age, gender and income.",

However, the optimization of E2E models lacks\nan intuitive method for handling decoding shifts, especially in scenarios with\na large number of domain-specific rare words that hold specific important\nmeanings. Furthermore, the absence of knowledge-intensive speech datasets in\nacademia has been a significant limiting factor, and the commonly used speech\ncorpora exhibit significant disparities with realistic conversation. To address\nthese challenges, we present Medical Interview (MED-IT), a multi-turn\nconsultation speech dataset that contains a substantial number of\nknowledge-intensive named entities. We also explore methods to enhance the\nrecognition performance of rare words for E2E models. We propose a novel\napproach, post-decoder biasing, which constructs a transform probability matrix\nbased on the distribution of training transcriptions. This guides the model to\nprioritize recognizing words in the biasing list. In our experiments, for\nsubsets of rare words appearing in the training speech between 10 and 20 times,\nand between 1 and 5 times, the proposed method achieves a relative improvement\nof 9.3% and 5.1%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "In the last years, Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy (IRRAS) became\na standard technique to study vibrational excitations of molecules. These\ninvestigations are strongly motivated by perspective applications in monitoring\nchemical processes. For a better understanding of the adsorption mechanism of\nmolecules on dielectrics, the polarization-dependence of an interaction of\ninfrared light with adsorbates at dielectric surfaces is commonly used. Thus,\nthe peak positions in absorption spectra could be different for s- and\np-polarized light. This shift between the peak positions depends on both the\nmolecule itself and the dielectric substrate. While the origin of this shift is\nwell understood for infinite two-dimensional adsorbate layers, finite-size\nsamples, which consist of 2D islands of a small number of molecules, have never\nbeen considered. Here, we present a study on polarization-dependent finite-size\neffects in the optical response of such islands on dielectric substrates. The\nstudy uses a multi-scale modeling approach that connects quantum chemistry\ncalculations to Maxwell scattering simulations. We distinguish the optical\nresponse of a single molecule, a finite number of molecules, and a\ntwo-dimensional adsorbate layer. We analyze CO and CO$_2$ molecules deposited\non CeO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates. The evolution of the shift between the\npolarization-dependent absorbance peaks is firstly studied for a single\nmolecule, which it does not exhibit for at all, and for finite molecular\nislands, which it increases with increasing island size for, as well as for an\ninfinite two-dimensional adsorbate layer. In the latter case, the agreement\nbetween the obtained results and the experimental IRRAS data and more\ntraditional three/four-layer-model theoretical studies supports the predictive\npower of the multi-scale approach.",

Due to their locality, these energies are potentially\ninteresting in fitting atomistic machine learning models as they inform about\nphysically relevant properties. However, computationally, quantum-mechanically\naccurate local energies are notoriously difficult to obtain for large systems.\nHere, we show that by employing semi-empirical correlations between different\ncomponents of the total energy, we can obtain well-defined local energies at a\nmoderate cost. We employ this methodology to investigate energetics in noble\nliquids or argon, krypton, and their mixture. Instead of using these local\nenergies to fit atomistic models, we show how well these local energies are\nreproduced by machine-learned models trained on the total energies. The results\nof our investigation suggest that smaller neural networks, trained only on the\ntotal energy of an atomistic system, are more likely to reproduce the\nunderlying local energy partitioning faithfully than larger networks.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that networks more capable of this energy\ndecomposition are, in turn, capable of transferring to previously unseen\nsystems. Our results are a step towards understanding how much physics can be\nlearned by neural networks and where this can be applied, particularly how a\nbetter understanding of physics aids in the transferability of these neural\nnetworks.",

Novel, variable trim kites have been developed that allow to\nmodulate the aerodynamic coefficients of the airborne system, significantly\nimproving the overall system efficiency. The flight control of variable trim\nkites is much more complex than that of previous kite generations and its\nmastering is a challenge and one of the keys to a successful operation.\nNumerical optimization is applied to find a set of flight trajectories in order\nto maximize the energy production while satisfying several constraints on the\nsystem operating in a wide range of conditions. This industry abstract provides\na general introduction of the trajectory optimization problem with variable\ntrim kites. We also briefly introduce the state-of-the-art optimization setup.\nThis is followed by demonstration of high-quality example results of the\noptimization.

      "abstract": "This document presents the statistical methods used to process low-level\nmeasurements in the presence of noise. These methods can be classical or\nBayesian. The question is placed in the general framework of the problem of\nnuisance parameters, one of the canonical problems of statistical inference. By\nusing a simple criterion proposed by Bolstad (2007), it is possible to define\nstatistically significant results during a measurement process (act of\nmeasuring in the vocabulary of metrology). This result is similar for a classic\nparadigm (called ``frequentist'') or Bayesian: the presence of zero in the\ninterval considered (confidence or credibility). It is shown that in the case\nof homoskedastic Gaussians, the commonly used results are found. The case of\nPoisson distributions is then considered. In the case of heteroscedastic\nGaussians, which is that of radioactivity measurement, we can consider them as\nPoisson laws in the limit of large counts. The results are different from those\ncommonly used, and in particular those from standards (ISO 11929). Their\nstatistical performances, characterized by simulation, are better and are well\nverified experimentally. This is confirmed theoretically by the use of the\nNeyman-Pearson lemma which makes it possible to formally determine the\nstatistical tests with the best performances. These results also make it\npossible to understand the paradox of the possible divergence of the detection\nlimit. It is also formally shown that the confidence intervals thus calculated\nby getting rid of the nuisance parameter according to established methods\nresult in the commonly used confidence interval. To our knowledge, this\nconstitutes the first formal derivation of these confidence intervals.This\nmethod is based on keeping the measurement results whether they are significant\nor not (not censoring them). This is recommended in several standards or\ndocuments, is compatible with the ISO 11929 standard and is in line with recent\nproposals in the field of statistics. On the other hand, all the information\nnecessary to determine whether a measurement result is significant or not\nremains available. The conservation and restitution of all results is currently\napplied in the USA. The textbook case of the WIPP incident makes it possible to\nensure favorable public perception.The implications and applications of this\nmethod in different fields are finally discussed.",

We show how we can define weakly-fair matchings\ngeometrically, for which poly-matroid properties imply that they are maximal.\nNext, we focus on strong fairness notions (inspired by group-fairness metrics\nin machine learning), where each group gets their exact same fraction of their\nentitlement, and we explore the Price of Fairness (PoF), i.e., the loss in\noptimality when imposing such fairness constraints. Importantly, we advocate\nfor the notion of opportunity fairness, where a group entitlement is the\nmaximum number of agents that can be matched without the presence of other\ncompeting groups.

      "abstract": "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a well-established procedure for computing\napproximate solutions to deterministic engineering problems described by\npartial differential equations. FEM produces discrete approximations of the\nsolution with a discretisation error that can be an be quantified with \\emph{a\nposteriori} error estimates. The practical relevance of error estimates for\nbiomechanics problems, especially for soft tissue where the response is\ngoverned by large strains, is rarely addressed. In this contribution, we\npropose an implementation of \\emph{a posteriori} error estimates targeting a\nuser-defined quantity of interest, using the Dual Weighted Residual (DWR)\ntechnique tailored to biomechanics. The proposed method considers a general\nsetting that encompasses three-dimensional geometries and model\nnon-linearities, which appear in hyperelastic soft tissues. We take advantage\nof the automatic differentiation capabilities embedded in modern finite element\nsoftware, which allows the error estimates to be computed generically for a\nlarge class of models and constitutive laws. First we validate our methodology\nusing experimental measurements from silicone samples, and then illustrate its\napplicability for patient-specific computations of pressure ulcers on a human\nheel.",

      "abstract": "The objective of our study is to observe dynamics of multiple substances in\nvivo with high temporal resolution from multi-spectral magnetic resonance\nspectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data. The multi-spectral MRSI can effectively\nseparate spectral peaks of multiple substances and is useful to measure spatial\ndistributions of substances. However it is difficult to measure time-varying\nsubstance distributions directly by ordinary full sampling because the\nmeasurement requires a significantly long time. In this study, we propose a\nnovel method to reconstruct the spatio-temporal distributions of substances\nfrom randomly undersampled multi-spectral MRSI data on the basis of compressed\nsensing (CS) and the partially separable function model with base spectra of\nsubstances. In our method, we have employed spatio-temporal sparsity and\ntemporal smoothness of the substance distributions as prior knowledge to\nperform CS. The effectiveness of our method has been evaluated using phantom\ndata sets of glass tubes filled with glucose or lactate solution in increasing\namounts over time and animal data sets of a tumor-bearing mouse to observe the\nmetabolic dynamics involved in the Warburg effect in vivo. The reconstructed\nresults are consistent with the expected behaviors, showing that our method can\nreconstruct the spatio-temporal distribution of substances with a temporal\nresolution of four seconds which is extremely short time scale compared with\nthat of full sampling. Since this method utilizes only prior knowledge\nnaturally assumed for the spatio-temporal distributions of substances and is\nindependent of the number of the spectral and spatial dimensions or the\nacquisition sequence of MRSI, it is expected to contribute to revealing the\nunderlying substance dynamics in MRSI data already acquired or to be acquired\nin the future.",

In general, the accuracy of machine\nlearning model predictions is closely related to the quality and quantitative\naspects of the data used, following the principle of \\textit{garbage-in,\ngarbage-out}. In order to quantitatively and qualitatively augment datasets,\none of the most prevalent concerns of data scientists is to generate synthetic\ndata, which should follow as closely as possible the actual pattern of the\noriginal data.\n  This study proposes three different data augmentation strategies based on\nfractal interpolation, namely the \\textit{Closest Hurst Strategy},\n\\textit{Closest Values Strategy} and \\textit{Formula Strategy}. To validate the\nstrategies, we used four public datasets from the literature, as well as a\nprivate dataset obtained from meteorological records in the city of Brasov,\nRomania. The prediction results obtained with the LSTM model using the\npresented interpolation strategies showed a significant accuracy improvement\ncompared to the raw datasets, thus providing a possible answer to practical\nproblems in the field of remote sensing and sensor sensitivity. Moreover, our\nmethodologies answer some optimization-related open questions for the fractal\ninterpolation step using \\textit{Optuna} framework.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of the Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET) technology advocates\nself-organized wireless interconnection of communication devices that would\neither extend or operate in concert with the wired networking infrastructure\nor, possibly, evolve to autonomous networks. In either case, the proliferation\nof MANET-based applications depends on a multitude of factors, with\ntrustworthiness being one of the primary challenges to be met. Despite the\nexistence of well-known security mechanisms, additional vulnerabilities and\nfeatures pertinent to this new networking paradigm might render such\ntraditional solutions inapplicable. In particular, the absence of a central\nauthorization facility in an open and distributed communication environment is\na major challenge, especially due to the need for cooperative network\noperation. In particular, in MANET, any node may compromise the routing\nprotocol functionality by disrupting the route discovery process. In this\npaper, we present a route discovery protocol that mitigates the detrimental\neffects of such malicious behavior, as to provide correct connectivity\ninformation. Our protocol guarantees that fabricated, compromised, or replayed\nroute replies would either be rejected or never reach back the querying node.\nFurthermore, the protocol responsiveness is safeguarded under different types\nof attacks that exploit the routing protocol itself. The sole requirement of\nthe proposed scheme is the existence of a security association between the node\ninitiating the query and the sought destination. Specifically, no assumption is\nmade regarding the intermediate nodes, which may exhibit arbitrary and\nmalicious behavior. The scheme is robust in the presence of a number of\nnon-colluding nodes, and provides accurate routing information in a timely\nmanner.",

This model is a three-component reaction-diffusion\nsystem that delineates the geographical expansion of an initially localized\npopulation of farmers into a region occupied by hunter-gatherers. By\nconsidering the scenario where farmers and hunter-gatherers possess identical\nmotility, Aoki et al. previously concluded, through numerical simulations and\nsome formal linearization arguments, that there are four different types of\nspreading behaviors depending on the parameter values. In this paper, we\nconcentrate on the general case for which farmers and hunter-gatherers possess\ndifferent motility. By providing more sophisticated estimates, we not only\ntheoretically justify the spreading speed of the Aoki-Shida-Shigesada model,\nbut also establish sharp estimates for the long-time behaviors of solutions.\nThese estimates enable us to validate all four types of spreading behaviors\nobserved by Aoki et al..",

However, improving their zero-shot reasoning typically requires\nsecond-stage instruction tuning, which relies heavily on human-labeled or large\nlanguage model-generated annotation, incurring high labeling costs. To tackle\nthis challenge, we introduce Image-Conditioned Caption Correction (ICCC), a\nnovel pre-training task designed to enhance VLMs' zero-shot performance without\nthe need for labeled task-aware data. The ICCC task compels VLMs to rectify\nmismatches between visual and language concepts, thereby enhancing instruction\nfollowing and text generation conditioned on visual inputs. Leveraging language\nstructure and a lightweight dependency parser, we construct data samples of\nICCC task from image-text datasets with low labeling and computation costs.\nExperimental results on BLIP-2 and InstructBLIP demonstrate significant\nimprovements in zero-shot image-text generation-based VL tasks through ICCC\ninstruction tuning.",

The methodology\napplies to fixed datasets -- i.e., is data-conditional -- and the only\nrandomness is due to the randomized algorithm. We propose statistical inference\nmethods for a broad range of sketching distributions, such as the subsampled\nrandomized Hadamard transform (SRHT), Sparse Sign Embeddings (SSE) and\nCountSketch, sketching matrices with i.i.d. entries, and uniform subsampling.\nTo our knowledge, no comparable methods are available for SSE and for SRHT in\nPCA.

As a contribution of broader interest, we show\ncentral limit theorems for quadratic forms of the SRHT, relying on a novel\nproof via a dyadic expansion that leverages the recursive structure of the\nHadamard transform.

Specifically, the LLaMA-Excitor does not directly\nchange the intermediate hidden state during the self-attention calculation of\nthe transformer structure. We designed the Excitor block as a bypass module for\nthe similarity score computation in LLMs' self-attention to reconstruct keys\nand change the importance of values by learnable prompts. LLaMA-Excitor ensures\na self-adaptive allocation of additional attention to input instructions, thus\neffectively preserving LLMs' pre-trained knowledge when fine-tuning LLMs on\nlow-quality instruction-following datasets. Furthermore, we unify the modeling\nof multi-modal tuning and language-only tuning, extending LLaMA-Excitor to a\npowerful visual instruction follower without the need for complex multi-modal\nalignment. Our proposed approach is evaluated in language-only and multi-modal\ntuning experimental scenarios.

      "abstract": "Given an input set of $3$D point pairs, the goal of outlier-robust $3$D\nregistration is to compute some rotation and translation that align as many\npoint pairs as possible. This is an important problem in computer vision, for\nwhich many highly accurate approaches have been recently proposed. Despite\ntheir impressive performance, these approaches lack scalability, often\noverflowing the $16$GB of memory of a standard laptop to handle roughly\n$30,000$ point pairs. In this paper, we propose a $3$D registration approach\nthat can process more than ten million ($10^7$) point pairs with over $99\\%$\nrandom outliers. Moreover, our method is efficient, entails low memory costs,\nand maintains high accuracy at the same time. We call our method TEAR, as it\ninvolves minimizing an outlier-robust loss that computes Truncated Entry-wise\nAbsolute Residuals. To minimize this loss, we decompose the original\n$6$-dimensional problem into two subproblems of dimensions $3$ and $2$,\nrespectively, solved in succession to global optimality via a customized\nbranch-and-bound method. While branch-and-bound is often slow and unscalable,\nthis does not apply to TEAR as we propose novel bounding functions that are\ntight and computationally efficient.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present GyroDeblurNet, a novel single image deblurring\nmethod that utilizes a gyro sensor to effectively resolve the ill-posedness of\nimage deblurring. The gyro sensor provides valuable information about camera\nmotion during exposure time that can significantly improve deblurring quality.\nHowever, effectively exploiting real-world gyro data is challenging due to\nsignificant errors from various sources including sensor noise, the disparity\nbetween the positions of a camera module and a gyro sensor, the absence of\ntranslational motion information, and moving objects whose motions cannot be\ncaptured by a gyro sensor. To handle gyro error, GyroDeblurNet is equipped with\ntwo novel neural network blocks: a gyro refinement block and a gyro deblurring\nblock. The gyro refinement block refines the error-ridden gyro data using the\nblur information from the input image. On the other hand, the gyro deblurring\nblock removes blur from the input image using the refined gyro data and further\ncompensates for gyro error by leveraging the blur information from the input\nimage. For training a neural network with erroneous gyro data, we propose a\ntraining strategy based on the curriculum learning. We also introduce a novel\ngyro data embedding scheme to represent real-world intricate camera shakes.\nFinally, we present a synthetic dataset and a real dataset for the training and\nevaluation of gyro-based single image deblurring. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat our approach achieves state-of-the-art deblurring quality by effectively\nutilizing erroneous gyro data.",

Upon doping electrons to the insulating LiTaO$_3$, the\npredicted $T_c$ is quickly suppressed and approaches those of the polar metals.\nThus, there is a continuous crossover between ferroelectric insulators and\npolar metals if we dope electrons to the polar metals. Investigating the\ndetailed material dependence of the interatomic force constants (IFCs), we\nexplicitly show that the suppression of $T_c$ in polar metals can be ascribed\nto the screening of the long-range Li-O interaction, which is caused by the\npresence of the itinerant electrons.",

To reduce the annotation cost, most existing matting\napproaches often rely on image synthesis to augment the dataset. However, the\nunnaturalness of synthesized training images brings in a new domain\ngeneralization challenge for natural images. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a new learning paradigm, weakly semi-supervised human matting\n(WSSHM), which leverages a small amount of expensive matte labels and a large\namount of budget-friendly segmentation labels, to save the annotation cost and\nresolve the domain generalization problem. To achieve the goal of WSSHM, we\npropose a simple and effective training method, named Matte Label Blending\n(MLB), that selectively guides only the beneficial knowledge of the\nsegmentation and matte data to the matting model. Extensive experiments with\nour detailed analysis demonstrate our method can substantially improve the\nrobustness of the matting model using a few matte data and numerous\nsegmentation data. Our training method is also easily applicable to real-time\nmodels, achieving competitive accuracy with breakneck inference speed (328 FPS\non NVIDIA V100 GPU). The implementation code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/clovaai/WSSHM}.",

      "abstract": "Pretrained diffusion models and their outputs are widely accessible due to\ntheir exceptional capacity for synthesizing high-quality images and their\nopen-source nature. The users, however, may face litigation risks owing to the\nmodels' tendency to memorize and regurgitate training data during inference. To\naddress this, we introduce Anti-Memorization Guidance (AMG), a novel framework\nemploying three targeted guidance strategies for the main causes of\nmemorization: image and caption duplication, and highly specific user prompts.\nConsequently, AMG ensures memorization-free outputs while maintaining high\nimage quality and text alignment, leveraging the synergy of its guidance\nmethods, each indispensable in its own right. AMG also features an innovative\nautomatic detection system for potential memorization during each step of\ninference process, allows selective application of guidance strategies,\nminimally interfering with the original sampling process to preserve output\nutility. We applied AMG to pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models\n(DDPM) and Stable Diffusion across various generation tasks. The results\ndemonstrate that AMG is the first approach to successfully eradicates all\ninstances of memorization with no or marginal impacts on image quality and\ntext-alignment, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores.",

      "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping is essential for position tracking and\nscene understanding. 3D Gaussian-based map representations enable\nphotorealistic reconstruction and real-time rendering of scenes using multiple\nposed cameras. We show for the first time that using 3D Gaussians for map\nrepresentation with unposed camera images and inertial measurements can enable\naccurate SLAM. Our method, MM3DGS, addresses the limitations of prior neural\nradiance field-based representations by enabling faster rendering, scale\nawareness, and improved trajectory tracking. Our framework enables\nkeyframe-based mapping and tracking utilizing loss functions that incorporate\nrelative pose transformations from pre-integrated inertial measurements, depth\nestimates, and measures of photometric rendering quality. We also release a\nmulti-modal dataset, UT-MM, collected from a mobile robot equipped with a\ncamera and an inertial measurement unit. Experimental evaluation on several\nscenes from the dataset shows that MM3DGS achieves 3x improvement in tracking\nand 5% improvement in photometric rendering quality compared to the current\n3DGS SLAM state-of-the-art, while allowing real-time rendering of a\nhigh-resolution dense 3D map.

A sign-text alignment\nloss further bridges the gap between sign and text tokens, enhancing semantic\ncompatibility. We achieve state-of-the-art gloss-free results on two\nwidely-used SLT benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) is an efficient model compression technique\nthat quantizes a pretrained full-precision model using only a small calibration\nset of unlabeled samples without retraining. PTQ methods for convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) provide quantization results comparable to\nfull-precision counterparts. Directly applying them to vision transformers\n(ViTs), however, incurs severe performance degradation, mainly due to the\ndifferences in architectures between CNNs and ViTs. In particular, the\ndistribution of activations for each channel vary drastically according to\ninput instances, making PTQ methods for CNNs inappropriate for ViTs. To address\nthis, we introduce instance-aware group quantization for ViTs (IGQ-ViT). To\nthis end, we propose to split the channels of activation maps into multiple\ngroups dynamically for each input instance, such that activations within each\ngroup share similar statistical properties. We also extend our scheme to\nquantize softmax attentions across tokens. In addition, the number of groups\nfor each layer is adjusted to minimize the discrepancies between predictions\nfrom quantized and full-precision models, under a bit-operation (BOP)\nconstraint. We show extensive experimental results on image classification,\nobject detection, and instance segmentation, with various transformer\narchitectures, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Socially assistive robots (SARs) have shown great success in providing\npersonalized cognitive-affective support for user populations with special\nneeds such as older adults, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and\nindividuals with mental health challenges. The large body of work on SAR\ndemonstrates its potential to provide at-home support that complements\nclinic-based interventions delivered by mental health professionals, making\nthese interventions more effective and accessible. However, there are still\nseveral major technical challenges that hinder SAR-mediated interactions and\ninterventions from reaching human-level social intelligence and efficacy. With\nthe recent advances in large language models (LLMs), there is an increased\npotential for novel applications within the field of SAR that can significantly\nexpand the current capabilities of SARs. However, incorporating LLMs introduces\nnew risks and ethical concerns that have not yet been encountered, and must be\ncarefully be addressed to safely deploy these more advanced systems. In this\nwork, we aim to conduct a brief survey on the use of LLMs in SAR technologies,\nand discuss the potentials and risks of applying LLMs to the following three\nmajor technical challenges of SAR: 1) natural language dialog; 2) multimodal\nunderstanding; 3) LLMs as robot policies.",

      "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly transformed the\nAI landscape, enhancing machine learning and AI capabilities. Factuality issue\nis a critical concern for LLMs, as they may generate factually incorrect\nresponses. In this paper, we propose GraphEval to evaluate an LLM's performance\nusing a substantially large test dataset. Specifically, the test dataset is\nretrieved from a large knowledge graph with more than 10 million facts without\nexpensive human efforts. Unlike conventional methods that evaluate LLMs based\non generated responses, GraphEval streamlines the evaluation process by\ncreating a judge model to estimate the correctness of the answers given by the\nLLM. Our experiments demonstrate that the judge model's factuality assessment\naligns closely with the correctness of the LLM's generated outputs, while also\nsubstantially reducing evaluation costs. Besides, our findings offer valuable\ninsights into LLM performance across different metrics and highlight the\npotential for future improvements in ensuring the factual integrity of LLM\noutputs.

      "abstract": "Many Hubble type S galaxies have a flat rotation curve, V extending into the\nouter disk. The surface brightness there is too low to create V from stars of a\nreasonable mass-to-light ratio. To maintain a stable disk, a massive dark\nmatter halo is usually assumed to dominate in creating V. Gravitational arm\namplification is used here to estimate whether V is created by a disk mixture,\nor by a 100 percent halo. The disk surface density is not estimated from the\ndisk surface brightness and an assumed mass to light ratio. The observed arm\npitch angle is presumed to be long term maximally amplified. This permits\ncalculation of the disk surface mass density with radius relative to a 100\npercent disk which would fully create V. NGC 7217's tightly wound 4.8 degree\narm pitch angle indicates a disk component contributing 43 percent of the\nobserved V for the range over the spiral arms (important but not dominant). It\nhas too low a disk density to create V with the rest presumably arising from a\nhalo. V is proportional to the square root of surface density. By contrast a\nloose arm galaxy disk can dominate in creating V. For example NGC 3198's arm\npitch angle of 30 degrees implies a disk surface density sufficient to account\nfor 88 percent of V which is a dominant fraction. Little dark matter halo is\nneeded for galaxies like this. Observationally, the dark outer disk may be\nmolecular hydrogen. NGC 3198's dominant disk also provides a counter example to\nthe need for any universal (MOND) force law modification over the outer disk\nspiral arms.",

      "abstract": "Batch Normalization is an important approach to advancing deep learning since\nit allows multiple networks to train simultaneously. A problem arises when\nnormalizing along the batch dimension because B.N.'s error increases\nsignificantly as batch size shrinks because batch statistics estimates are\ninaccurate. As a result, computer vision tasks like detection, segmentation,\nand video, which require tiny batches based on memory consumption, aren't\nsuitable for using Batch Normalization for larger model training and feature\ntransfer. Here, we explore Group Normalization as an easy alternative to using\nBatch Normalization A Group Normalization is a channel normalization method in\nwhich each group is divided into different channels, and the corresponding mean\nand variance are calculated for each group. Group Normalization computations\nare accurate across a wide range of batch sizes and are independent of batch\nsize. When trained using a large ImageNet database on ResNet-50, GN achieves a\nvery low error rate of 10.6% compared to Batch Normalization. when a smaller\nbatch size of only 2 is used. For usual batch sizes, the performance of G.N. is\ncomparable to that of Batch Normalization, but at the same time, it outperforms\nother normalization techniques.

The height function is a\nfundamental and important tool in number theory to capture the\n``number-theoretic complexity\" of a point. Asymptotic formulas for the number\nof points in projective space below a given height have been studied by\nSchanuel, for example, and their coefficients can be written by class numbers,\nregulators, special values of the Dedekind zeta function, and other number\ntheoretically interesting values. We consider an analogous problem for\ndynamical canonical height, a dynamical analogue of the height function in\nnumber theory, introduced by Call-Silverman . The main tool of this study is\nthe dynamical height zeta function studied by Hsia. In this paper, we give\nexplicit formulas for the dynamical height zeta function in special cases,\nderive general formulas for obtaining asymptotic behavior from certain\nfunctions, and combine them to derive asymptotic behavior for the number of\npoints with bounded dynamical canonical height.",

Based\non the assumption of local rigidity, one solution for reducing complexity is to\ndecompose the overall shape into independent local regions using Local\nReference Frames (LRFs) that are invariant to SE(3) transformations. However,\nthe focus solely on local structure neglects global geometric contexts,\nresulting in less distinctive LRFs that lack crucial semantic information\nnecessary for effective matching. Furthermore, such complexity introduces\nout-of-distribution geometric contexts during inference, thus complicating\ngeneralization. To this end, we introduce 1) EquiShape, a novel structure\ntailored to learn pair-wise LRFs with global structural cues for both spatial\nand semantic consistency, and 2) LRF-Refine, an optimization strategy generally\napplicable to LRF-based methods, aimed at addressing the generalization\nchallenges. Specifically, for EquiShape, we employ cross-talk within separate\nequivariant graph neural networks (Cross-GVP) to build long-range dependencies\nto compensate for the lack of semantic information in local structure modeling,\ndeducing pair-wise independent SE(3)-equivariant LRF vectors for each point.\nFor LRF-Refine, the optimization adjusts LRFs within specific contexts and\nknowledge, enhancing the geometric and semantic generalizability of point\nfeatures.

In a finite-horizon offline setting, the goal is to optimize the\nbeam-forming design, the 3D UAV positioning and trajectory solution, and the\nuser association/scheduling policy, to maximize the cumulative fleet-wide\nreward obtained by satisfying the quality-of-service mandates imposed on each\nuser uplink request, subject to an average per-UAV mobility power constraint.\nWith a probabilistic air-to-ground channel model, a multi-user MIMO uplink\ncommunication model with prioritized traffic, and a novel 3D mobility model for\nrotary-wing UAVs, the fleet-wide reward maximization problem is solved via a\ncross-layer optimization framework: first, K-means clustering is employed to\nobtain user clusters; then, equipped with a zero-forcing beam-forming design,\nthe positions of the UAVs are optimized via two-stage grid search; next,\ntreating these optimal positions as the graph vertices of a fully-connected\nmesh, the 3D UAV trajectories (i.e., graph edges) are designed via a learning\nbased competitive swarm optimization algorithm, under an average UAV power\nconsumption constraint, coupled with projected subgradient ascent for dual\noptimization; consequently, the user association/scheduling strategy is solved\nvia a graphical branch-and-bound method on the underlying multiple traveling\nsalesman problem. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed solution\noutperforms static UAV deployments, adaptive Voronoi decomposition techniques,\nand state-of-the-art iterative fleet control algorithms, with respect to user\nquality-of-service and per-UAV average power consumption.",

      "abstract": "Can we train a molecule generator that can generate 3D molecules from a new\ndomain, circumventing the need to collect data? This problem can be cast as the\nproblem of domain adaptive molecule generation. This work presents a novel and\nprincipled diffusion-based approach, called GADM, that allows shifting a\ngenerative model to desired new domains without the need to collect even a\nsingle molecule. As the domain shift is typically caused by the structure\nvariations of molecules, e.g., scaffold variations, we leverage a designated\nequivariant masked autoencoder (MAE) along with various masking strategies to\ncapture the structural-grained representations of the in-domain varieties. In\nparticular, with an asymmetric encoder-decoder module, the MAE can generalize\nto unseen structure variations from the target domains. These structure\nvariations are encoded with an equivariant encoder and treated as domain\nsupervisors to control denoising. We show that, with these encoded\nstructural-grained domain supervisors, GADM can generate effective molecules\nwithin the desired new domains. We conduct extensive experiments across various\ndomain adaptation tasks over benchmarking datasets. We show that our approach\ncan improve up to 65.6% in terms of success rate defined based on molecular\nvalidity, uniqueness, and novelty compared to alternative baselines.",

Contrary to the case of $A$ = K and Rb, the energetic\npositions of the low-lying Van Hove singularities are reversed in\nCsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, and the characteristic higher-order Van Hove point gets\ncloser to the Fermi level. We found that this notable difference can be\nattributed to the chemical effect, apart from structural differences. Due to\ntheir different orbital compositions, Van Hove points show qualitatively\ndifferent responses to the structure changes. A previously unnoticed highest\nlying point can be lowered, locating close to or even below the other ones in\nresponse to a reasonable range of bi- and uni-axial strain.

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) can\neffectively capture such spatial feature representations and have demonstrated\npromising results in performing hyperspectral imagery (HSI) classification\ntasks of complex land. However, the existing GCN-based HSI classification\nmethods are prone to interference from redundant information when extracting\ncomplex features. To classify complex scenes more effectively, this study\nproposes a novel spatial-spectral reliable contrastive graph convolutional\nclassification framework named S2RC-GCN. Specifically, we fused the spectral\nand spatial features extracted by the 1D- and 2D-encoder, and the 2D-encoder\nincludes an attention model to automatically extract important information. We\nthen leveraged the fused high-level features to construct graphs and fed the\nresulting graphs into the GCNs to determine more effective graph\nrepresentations. Furthermore, a novel reliable contrastive graph convolution\nwas proposed for reliable contrastive learning to learn and fuse robust\nfeatures. Finally, to test the performance of the model on complex object\nclassification, we used imagery taken by Gaofen-5 in the Jiang Xia area to\nconstruct complex land cover datasets.

Although these\nimage-language models can efficiently represent both video and language\nbranches, they typically employ a goal-free vision perception process and do\nnot interact vision with language well during the answer generation, thus\nomitting crucial visual cues. In this paper, we are inspired by the human\nrecognition and learning pattern and propose VideoDistill, a framework with\nlanguage-aware (i.e., goal-driven) behavior in both vision perception and\nanswer generation process. VideoDistill generates answers only from\nquestion-related visual embeddings and follows a thinking-observing-answering\napproach that closely resembles human behavior, distinguishing it from previous\nresearch. Specifically, we develop a language-aware gating mechanism to replace\nthe standard cross-attention, avoiding language's direct fusion into visual\nrepresentations. We incorporate this mechanism into two key components of the\nentire framework. The first component is a differentiable sparse sampling\nmodule, which selects frames containing the necessary dynamics and semantics\nrelevant to the questions. The second component is a vision refinement module\nthat merges existing spatial-temporal attention layers to ensure the extraction\nof multi-grained visual semantics associated with the questions. We conduct\nexperimental evaluations on various challenging video question-answering\nbenchmarks, and VideoDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance in both\ngeneral and long-form VideoQA datasets.

      "abstract": "Visual scenes are naturally organized in a hierarchy, where a coarse semantic\nis recursively comprised of several fine details. Exploring such a visual\nhierarchy is crucial to recognize the complex relations of visual elements,\nleading to a comprehensive scene understanding. In this paper, we propose a\nVisual Hierarchy Mapper (Hi-Mapper), a novel approach for enhancing the\nstructured understanding of the pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).\nHi-Mapper investigates the hierarchical organization of the visual scene by 1)\npre-defining a hierarchy tree through the encapsulation of probability\ndensities; and 2) learning the hierarchical relations in hyperbolic space with\na novel hierarchical contrastive loss. The pre-defined hierarchy tree\nrecursively interacts with the visual features of the pre-trained DNNs through\nhierarchy decomposition and encoding procedures, thereby effectively\nidentifying the visual hierarchy and enhancing the recognition of an entire\nscene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-Mapper significantly enhances\nthe representation capability of DNNs, leading to an improved performance on\nvarious tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks.",

Lateral hetereogeneities are accounted for by an\noptimized (Gaussian) beam splitting scheme. Adjoint theory is applied to\napproximate the change in the deposited dose caused by a new underlying patient\nanatomy.\n  $\\textbf{Results:}$ The quality of the dose engine was benchmarked through\nthree-dimensional gamma index comparisons against Monte Carlo simulations done\nin TOPAS. The worst passing rate for the gamma index with (1 mm, 1 %, 10 % dose\ncut-off) criteria is 95.62 %. The effect of delivering treatment plans on\nrepeat CTs was also tested. For a non-robustly optimized plan the adjoint\ncomponent was accurate to 6.2 % while for a robustly optimized plan it was\naccurate to 1 %.\n  $\\textbf{Conclusions:}$ YODA is capable of accurate dose computations in both\nsingle and multi spot irradiations when compared to TOPAS. Moreover, it is able\nto compute dosimetric differences due to anatomical changes with small to\nmoderate errors thereby facilitating its use for patient-specific quality\nassurance in online adaptive proton therapy.",

      "abstract": "Mega low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation is promising in achieving\nglobal coverage with high capacity. However, forwarding packets in mega\nconstellation faces long end-to-end delay caused by multi-hop routing and\nhigh-complexity routing table construction, which will detrimentally impair the\nnetwork transmission efficiency. To overcome this issue, a distributed\nlow-complexity satellite-terrestrial cooperative routing approach is proposed\nin this paper, and its core idea is that each node forwards packets to next-hop\nnode under the constraints of minimum end-to-end hop-count and queuing delay.\nParticularly, to achieve an accurate and low-complexity minimum end-to-end\nhop-count estimation in satellite-terrestrial cooperative routing scenario, we\nfirst introduce a satellite real-time position based graph (RTPG) to simplify\nthe description of three-dimensional constellation, and further abstract RTPG\ninto a key node based graph (KNBG). Considering the frequent regeneration of\nKNBG due to satellite movement, a low complexity generation method of KNBG is\nstudied as well. Finally, utilizing KNBG as input, we design the minimum\nend-to-end hop-count estimation method (KNBG-MHCE). Meanwhile, the\ncomputational complexity, routing path survival probability and practical\nimplementation of our proposal are all deeply discussed. Extensive simulations\nare also conducted in systems with Ka and laser band inter-satellite links to\nverify the superiority of our proposal.",

      "abstract": "Optical solitons in multimode fibers have been predicted 40 years ago and\nextensively investigated theoretically. Transmission experiments in nonlinear\nmultimode fibers have gained renewed interest, motivated by their potential to\nextend the capacity of long-distance transmission systems; only in the last few\nyears, new experiments have revealed unexpected properties of optical solitons\npropagating in graded-index and step-index multimode fibers, partially\nre-writing the existing theory. Here we provide an overview of the recent\nexperimental, numerical and theoretical studies which revealed those new\nproperties. It will be shown that multimode fiber solitons form with specific\npulse width and energy dependent on the wavelength, and that they naturally\nevolve toward fundamental-mode Raman solitons. New soliton fission mechanisms,\ngoverned by the modal dispersion, will be explained. Possible applications in\nspace-division multiplexed systems will be discussed. A recent thermodynamic\napproach to soliton condensation will be described.",

What a wonderful ride it is! What a\nbeautiful life we have. But wait, there's one tiny little problem that utterly\nshatters the peace, turning even renowned scientists into bloodthirsty\nmonsters: author order. The reason is that, contrary to widespread opinion,\nit's not the font size that matters, but the way things are ordered. Of course,\nthis is a fairly well-known fact among scientists all across the planet (and\nbeyond) and explains clearly why we regularly have to read about yet another\nescalated paper submission in local police reports.\n  In this paper, we take an important step backwards to tackle this issue by\nsolving the so-called author ordering problem (AOP) once and for all.\nSpecifically, we propose AMOR, a system that replaces silly constructs like\nco-first or co-middle authorship with a simple yet easy probabilistic approach\nbased on random shuffling of the author list at viewing time.

      "abstract": "Strongly correlated electron systems with a kagome lattice can host abundant\nexotic quantum states such as superconductivity and spin/charge density waves\n(CDW) due to the complicated interactions between different degrees of freedoms\nin the framework of a unique two-dimensional geometrically frustrated lattice\nstructure. Recently, successive orders of A-type antiferromagnetism (AFM),\n$2\\times2\\times2$ CDW and canted double-cone AFM have been manifested upon\ncooling in magnetic kagome FeGe. However, the mechanism of the CDW order and\nits interaction with magnetism are presently enigmatic at best. Here we\ninvestigate the evolution of CDW order with temperature across the spin canting\ntransition in FeGe by single-crystal x-ray diffraction. Refinements of its\nmodulated structure are presented using the superspace approach. Interestingly,\nthe superlattice reflections originating from CDW-induced long-range structural\nmodulation become extremely weak after the system enters the canted AFM while a\n$2\\times2$ CDW in the $ab$ plane persists as a long-range order demonstrated by\nstrong electronic modulation in the d$I$/d$V$ map of scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy. We discovered a novel CDW order without long-range structural\nmodulation in FeGe probably because of the competition between CDW and canted\nAFM in determining the underlying crystal structure. In addition, occupational\nmodulations of Ge1 atoms located in the kagome plane and displacive modulations\nof all the atoms were extracted from the refinements, confirming the existence\nof Ge atom dimerization along the $c$ axis as the major distortion and\nindicating a dynamic transformation between different CDW domains.",

      "abstract": "We consider an unanswered question in the discourse processing community: why\ndo relation classifiers trained on explicit examples (with connectives removed)\nperform poorly in real implicit scenarios? Prior work claimed this is due to\nlinguistic dissimilarity between explicit and implicit examples but provided no\nempirical evidence. In this study, we show that one cause for such failure is a\nlabel shift after connectives are eliminated. Specifically, we find that the\ndiscourse relations expressed by some explicit instances will change when\nconnectives disappear. Unlike previous work manually analyzing a few examples,\nwe present empirical evidence at the corpus level to prove the existence of\nsuch shift. Then, we analyze why label shift occurs by considering factors such\nas the syntactic role played by connectives, ambiguity of connectives, and\nmore. Finally, we investigate two strategies to mitigate the label shift:\nfiltering out noisy data and joint learning with connectives. Experiments on\nPDTB 2.0, PDTB 3.0, and the GUM dataset demonstrate that classifiers trained\nwith our strategies outperform strong baselines.",

Accordingly, the most well-adopted choice of the\ncoupling function is the sine function. Due to the oddness of the sine\nfunction, the synchronized frequency would be the average of all the natural\nfrequencies. In this article, we study the synchronization behaviors of the\nKuramoto model with a pure competition coupling function. Namely, instead of\nthe sine function, we choose $\\max \\{0, \\sin \\theta \\}$ to be the coupling\nfunction. This indicates the relation of pure competition between oscillators.\nWe prove asymptotical phase synchronization for identical oscillators and\nasymptotical frequency synchronization for non-identical oscillators under\nreasonable sufficient conditions. In particular, under our sufficient\nconditions, the synchronized frequency is the maximal frequency of all the\nnatural frequencies. On the other hand, in the parameter regime which is out of\nthe scope of the analysis of our theorems, it is possible that the synchronized\nfrequency could be larger than the maximal frequency of the natural frequencies\nof all the oscillators. In this article, we also provide numerical experiments\nto support the analysis of our theorem and to demonstrate the aforementioned\nphenomenon.",

      "abstract": "In this thesis, we consider fermion systems on square lattice spaces with a\ncurved domain-wall mass term. In a similar way to the flat case, we find\nmassless and chiral states localized at the wall. In the case of $S^1$ and\n$S^2$ domain-wall embedded into a square lattice, we find that these edge\nstates feel gravity through the induced spin connection. In the conventional\ncontinuum limit of the higher dimensional lattice, we find a good consistency\nwith the analytic results in the continuum theory. We also confirm that the\nrotational symmetry is recovered automatically.\n  We also discuss the effect of a $U(1)$ gauge connection on a two-dimensional\nlattice fermion with the $S^1$ domain-wall mass term. We find that the gauge\nfield changes the eigenvalue spectrum of the boundary system by the\nAharanov-Bohm effect and generates an anomaly of the time-reversal ($T$)\nsymmetry. Our numerical evaluation is consistent with the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer\nindex, which describes the cancellation of the $T$ anomaly by the topological\nterm on the bulk system. When we squeeze the flux inside one plaquette while\nkeeping the total flux unchanged, the anomaly inflow undergoes a drastic\nchange. The intense flux gives rise to an additional domain wall around the\nflux. We observe a novel localized mode at the flux, canceling the $T$ anomaly\non the wall instead of the topological term in the bulk.\n  We apply the study to a problem in condensed matter physics. It is known that\ninside topological insulators, a vortex or monopole acquires a fractional\nelectric charge and turns into a dyon. Describing the topological insulator as\na negative mass region of a Dirac fermion, we provide a microscopic description\nof this phenomenon in terms of the dynamical domain-wall creation.",

      "abstract": "Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is considered a candidate problem for\ndemonstrating quantum advantage. We propose an algorithm for approximate\nclassical simulation of a lossy GBS instance. The algorithm relies on the\nTaylor series expansion, and increasing the number of terms of the expansion\nthat are used in the calculation yields greater accuracy. The complexity of the\nalgorithm is polynomial in the number of modes given the number of terms is\nfixed. We describe conditions for the input state squeezing parameter and loss\nlevel that provide the best efficiency for this algorithm (by efficient we mean\nthat the Taylor series converges quickly). In recent experiments that claim to\nhave demonstrated quantum advantage, these conditions are satisfied; thus, this\nalgorithm can be used to classically simulate these experiments.",

      "abstract": "Carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) are showing significant potential in\nvarious fields, such as electronics, energy, and mechanics. However, their\npractical applications face synthesis challenges stemming from the complexities\nof structural control, large-area uniformity, and high yield. Current research\nmethodologies fall short in addressing the multi-variable, coupled interactions\ninherent to CBNs production. Machine learning methods excel at navigating such\ncomplexities. Their integration with automated synthesis platforms has\ndemonstrated remarkable potential in accelerating chemical synthesis research,\nbut remains underexplored in the nanomaterial domain. Here we introduce Carbon\nCopilot (CARCO), an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform that\nintegrates transformer-based language models tailored for carbon materials,\nrobotic chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and data-driven machine learning\nmodels, empowering accelerated research of CBNs synthesis. Employing CARCO, we\ndemonstrate innovative catalyst discovery by predicting a superior\nTitanium-Platinum bimetallic catalyst for high-density horizontally aligned\ncarbon nanotube (HACNT) array synthesis, validated through over 500\nexperiments. Furthermore, with the assistance of millions of virtual\nexperiments, we achieved an unprecedented 56.25% precision in synthesizing\nHACNT arrays with predetermined densities in the real world. All were\naccomplished within just 43 days. This work not only advances the field of\nHACNT arrays but also exemplifies the integration of AI with human expertise to\novercome the limitations of traditional experimental approaches, marking a\nparadigm shift in nanomaterials research and paving the way for broader\napplications.",

      "abstract": "Teeth localization, segmentation, and labeling in 2D images have great\npotential in modern dentistry to enhance dental diagnostics, treatment\nplanning, and population-based studies on oral health. However, general\ninstance segmentation frameworks are incompetent due to 1) the subtle\ndifferences between some teeth' shapes (e.g., maxillary first premolar and\nsecond premolar), 2) the teeth's position and shape variation across subjects,\nand 3) the presence of abnormalities in the dentition (e.g., caries and\nedentulism). To address these problems, we propose a ViT-based framework named\nTeethSEG, which consists of stacked Multi-Scale Aggregation (MSA) blocks and an\nAnthropic Prior Knowledge (APK) layer. Specifically, to compose the two\nmodules, we design 1) a unique permutation-based upscaler to ensure high\nefficiency while establishing clear segmentation boundaries with 2) multi-head\nself/cross-gating layers to emphasize particular semantics meanwhile\nmaintaining the divergence between token embeddings. Besides, we collect 3) the\nfirst open-sourced intraoral image dataset IO150K, which comprises over 150k\nintraoral photos, and all photos are annotated by orthodontists using a\nhuman-machine hybrid algorithm. Experiments on IO150K demonstrate that our\nTeethSEG outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation models on dental image\nsegmentation.",

      "abstract": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to temporally locate abnormal events in a\nvideo. Existing works mostly rely on training deep models to learn the\ndistribution of normality with either video-level supervision, one-class\nsupervision, or in an unsupervised setting. Training-based methods are prone to\nbe domain-specific, thus being costly for practical deployment as any domain\nchange will involve data collection and model training. In this paper, we\nradically depart from previous efforts and propose LAnguage-based VAD (LAVAD),\na method tackling VAD in a novel, training-free paradigm, exploiting the\ncapabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and existing\nvision-language models (VLMs). We leverage VLM-based captioning models to\ngenerate textual descriptions for each frame of any test video. With the\ntextual scene description, we then devise a prompting mechanism to unlock the\ncapability of LLMs in terms of temporal aggregation and anomaly score\nestimation, turning LLMs into an effective video anomaly detector. We further\nleverage modality-aligned VLMs and propose effective techniques based on\ncross-modal similarity for cleaning noisy captions and refining the LLM-based\nanomaly scores. We evaluate LAVAD on two large datasets featuring real-world\nsurveillance scenarios (UCF-Crime and XD-Violence), showing that it outperforms\nboth unsupervised and one-class methods without requiring any training or data\ncollection.",

      "abstract": "To fully leverage the multi-task optimization paradigm for accelerating the\nsolution of expensive scheduling problems, this study has effectively tackled\nthree vital concerns. The primary issue is identifying auxiliary tasks that\nclosely resemble the original expensive task. We suggested a sampling strategy\nbased on job importance, creating a compact matrix by extracting crucial rows\nfrom the entire problem specification matrix of the expensive task. This matrix\nserves as an economical auxiliary task. Mathematically, we proved that this\neconomical auxiliary task bears similarity to its corresponding expensive task.\nThe subsequent concern revolves around making auxiliary tasks more\ncost-effective. We determined the sampling proportions for the entire problem\nspecification matrix through factorial design experiments, resulting in a more\ncompact auxiliary task. With a reduced search space and shorter function\nevaluation time, it can rapidly furnish high-quality transferable information\nfor the primary task. The last aspect involves designing transferable deep\ninformation from auxiliary tasks. We regarded the job priorities in the (sub-)\noptimal solutions to the economical auxiliary task as transferable invariants.\nBy adopting a partial solution patching strategy, we augmented specificity\nknowledge onto the common knowledge to adapt to the target expensive task. The\nstrategies devised for constructing task pairs and facilitating knowledge\ntransfer, when incorporated into various evolutionary multitasking algorithms,\nwere utilized to address expensive instances of permutation flow shop\nscheduling. Extensive experiments and statistical comparisons have validated\nthat, with the collaborative synergy of these strategies, the performance of\nevolutionary multitasking algorithms is significantly enhanced in handling\nexpensive scheduling tasks.",

However,\nthe strain amplitude at which the transition is observed is larger in the shear\nstrain than in the tensile-compressive mode. The threshold strain amplitude is\nconfirmed by analyzing the dynamical properties, such as mobility and atomic\nstrain (von-Mises shear strain and the volumetric strain).

      "title": "Oscillating flow around a circular cylindrical post confined between two\n  parallel plates",
      "abstract": "This work is motivated by the interest in determining the effect of the\nmicro-anatomy of the spinal subarachnoid space on the cerebrospinal fluid flow\nand on the associated transport of solutes. To that aim, we focus on a\ncanonical model problem in which a circular post of radius $a$, confined\nbetween two parallel plates separated by a distance $2h$, is subjected to an\noscillatory flow. In particular, we are concerned with the steady, viscous,\ntime-averaged flow that persists in the vicinity on the cylinder, when the\nstroke length of the oscillating flow, $U_{\\infty}/\\omega$ is smaller or\ncomparable to the radius of the post, $a$, where $U_{\\infty}$ and $\\omega$ are\nthe mean velocity amplitude and the corresponding angular frequency,\nrespectively. First, we analyze the asymptotic limit of small values of the\nstroke length varying the aspect ratio of the post $\\lambda$ and the Womersley\nnumber $M$. First-order steady-streaming corrections at leading order have been\ncomputed, together with associated Stokes-drift component, the sum of both\nyielding the mean Lagrangian velocity field. The confinement effect is seen to\ninduce the three-dimensionality of flow. Moreover, in the mid plane the\ntime-averaged steady flow exhibits a recirculating vortex attached to the wall\nof the post that decreases as $M$ increases for low values of $M$. However, for\nvalues of $M$ larger than a critical one, $M_{cr}(\\lambda)$, a second, outer\nvortex is also formed. The dependence $M_{cr}(\\lambda)$ has been quantified.\nThe analysis has been corroborated experimentally for a fixed aspect ratio.\nConsideration of an anharmonic oscillating flow shows the fort-and-aft symmetry\nof the steady flow is broken. Finally, the analysis is experimentally extended\nto consider an array of equally spaced posts.",

      "abstract": "In order to theoretically understand dust properties in the circum-galactic\nmedium (CGM), we construct a dust evolution model that incorporates the\nevolution of grain size distribution. We treat each of the galaxy and the CGM\nas a one-zone object, and consider the mass exchange between them. We take into\naccount dust production and interstellar dust processing for the galaxy based\non our previous models, and newly incorporate sputtering in the hot phase and\nshattering in the cool phase for the CGM. We find that shattering increases the\ndust destruction (sputtering) efficiency in the CGM. The functional shape of\nthe grain size distribution in the CGM evolves following that in the galaxy,\nbut it is sensitive to the balance between sputtering and shattering in the\nCGM. For an observational test, we discuss the wavelength dependence of the\nreddening in the CGM traced by background quasar colors, arguing that, in order\nto explain the observed reddening level, a rapid inflow from the CGM to the\ngalaxy is favored because of quick dust/metal enrichment. Small grain\nproduction by shattering in the CGM also helps to explain the rise of dust\nextinction toward short wavelengths.",

      "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) has garnered increasing attention due to its\nwide range of applications in various fields, including human-machine\ninteraction, virtual assistants, and mental health assistance. However,\nexisting SER methods often overlook the information gap between the\npre-training speech recognition task and the downstream SER task, resulting in\nsub-optimal performance. Moreover, current methods require much time for\nfine-tuning on each specific speech dataset, such as IEMOCAP, which limits\ntheir effectiveness in real-world scenarios with large-scale noisy data. To\naddress these issues, we propose an active learning (AL)-based fine-tuning\nframework for SER, called \\textsc{After}, that leverages task adaptation\npre-training (TAPT) and AL methods to enhance performance and efficiency.\nSpecifically, we first use TAPT to minimize the information gap between the\npre-training speech recognition task and the downstream speech emotion\nrecognition task. Then, AL methods are employed to iteratively select a subset\nof the most informative and diverse samples for fine-tuning, thereby reducing\ntime consumption. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method\n\\textsc{After}, using only 20\\% of samples, improves accuracy by 8.45\\% and\nreduces time consumption by 79\\%. The additional extension of \\textsc{After}\nand ablation studies further confirm its effectiveness and applicability to\nvarious real-world scenarios. Our source code is available on Github for\nreproducibility. (https://github.com/Clearloveyuan/AFTER).",

Furthermore, for the\nconstacyclic code $\\mathcal{C}$ belonging to two special types, we obtain a\nsmaller upper bound on the number of non-zero weights of $\\mathcal{C}$ by\nsubstituting $\\mathcal{G}$ with a larger subgroup of ${\\rm Aut}(\\mathcal{C})$.\nThe results derived in this paper generalize the main results in [Chen, Fu and\nLiu, IEEE-TIT, 2024]}.",

Purpose: The main thrust of this paper is to study pp scattering\nusing the phase function method to obtain the observed S-wave phase shifts and\ncross-sections at various energies. Methods: The pp interaction has been\nmodeled by choosing the Malfliet-Tjon potential for the nuclear part along with\nthe screened Coulomb potential. The phase equation has been solved to obtain\nscattering phase shifts using the fourth-order RK method (RK-4). Results: The\ninteraction potential obtained from optimized parameters matches well with the\nrealistic Argonne V18 potential for 1S0 state of pp scattering and the\nscattering phase shifts as well as the cross-section for energies ranging from\n1-350 MeV are in good agreement with expected data. Conclusion: Introducing the\nphase function method for S-wave (l=0) could bring this interesting study of\nnucleon-nucleon scattering to the undergraduate classroom.",

Our proposed\nsystem harnesses the capabilities of the state-of-the-art Mistral model,\ncomplemented by an auxiliary model, to focus on the intricate input space of\nthe NLI4CT dataset. Through the incorporation of numerical and acronym-based\nperturbations to the data, we train a robust system capable of handling both\nsemantic-altering and numerical contradiction interventions.

      "abstract": "Information access systems are getting complex, and our understanding of user\nbehavior during information seeking processes is mainly drawn from qualitative\nmethods, such as observational studies or surveys. Leveraging the advances in\nsensing technologies, our study aims to characterize user behaviors with\nphysiological signals, particularly in relation to cognitive load, affective\narousal, and valence. We conduct a controlled lab study with 26 participants,\nand collect data including Electrodermal Activities, Photoplethysmogram,\nElectroencephalogram, and Pupillary Responses. This study examines\ninformational search with four stages: the realization of Information Need\n(IN), Query Formulation (QF), Query Submission (QS), and Relevance Judgment\n(RJ). We also include different interaction modalities to represent modern\nsystems, e.g., QS by text-typing or verbalizing, and RJ with text or audio\ninformation. We analyze the physiological signals across these stages and\nreport outcomes of pairwise non-parametric repeated-measure statistical tests.\nThe results show that participants experience significantly higher cognitive\nloads at IN with a subtle increase in alertness, while QF requires higher\nattention. QS involves demanding cognitive loads than QF. Affective responses\nare more pronounced at RJ than QS or IN, suggesting greater interest and\nengagement as knowledge gaps are resolved. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first study that explores user behaviors in a search process employing a\nmore nuanced quantitative analysis of physiological signals. Our findings offer\nvaluable insights into user behavior and emotional responses in information\nseeking processes. We believe our proposed methodology can inform the\ncharacterization of more complex processes, such as conversational information\nseeking.",

However, the\nabsolute abundance of heavy ions (relative to hydrogen) near 1 au might be\ndifferent from the coronal abundance due to the ion-proton differential speed\n($V_{ip}$). To illustrate the $V_{ip}$ characteristics and explore whether it\ninfluences the absolute abundance analysis for ICMEs and solar wind, we perform\na statistical study on the $V_{ip}$ for He$^{2+}$, C$^{5+}$, O$^{6+}$, and\nFe$^{10+}$ in both ICMEs and solar wind based on measurements of Advanced\nComposition Explorer. The results show that the $V_{ip}$ is negligible within\nICMEs and slow solar wind ($<$ 400 km s$^{-1}$), while obvious in the\nintermediate (400 -- 600 km s$^{-1}$) and fast wind ($>$ 600 km s$^{-1}$).\nPrevious studies showed that the $V_{ip}$ in ICMEs keeps negligible during\npropagation from 0.3 to 5 au, but in solar wind it increases with the\ndecreasing heliocentric distance. Therefore, it might be questionable to infer\nthe absolute abundance of coronal sources through in-situ abundance near 1 au\nfor solar wind. Fortunately, the ion-oxygen (O$^{6+}$) differential speed\n($V_{io}$) is negligible for He$^{2+}$, C$^{5+}$, and Fe$^{10+}$ within both\nICMEs and solar wind, and previous studies suggested that the $V_{io}$ does not\nvary significantly with the heliocentric distance. This indicates that various\nheavy ions always flow at the same bulk speed and their relative abundance\n(relative to oxygen) near 1 au can represent the coronal abundance for both\nICMEs and solar wind.",

      "abstract": "The tight relationship between infrared luminosity (L$_\\mathrm{TIR}$) and 1.4\nGHz radio continuum luminosity (L$_\\mathrm{1.4GHz}$) has proven useful for\nunderstanding star formation free from dust obscuration. Infrared emission in\nstar-forming galaxies typically arises from recently formed, dust-enshrouded\nstars, whereas radio synchrotron emission is expected from subsequent\nsupernovae. By leveraging the wealth of ancillary far-ultraviolet -\nfar-infrared photometry from the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey\n(DEVILS) and Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) surveys, combined with 1.4 GHz\nobservations from the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic\nExploration (MIGHTEE) survey and Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins\n(DINGO) projects, we investigate the impact of timescale differences between\nfar-ultraviolet - far-infrared and radio-derived star formation rate (SFR)\ntracers. We examine how the SED-derived star formation histories (SFH) of\ngalaxies can be used to explain discrepancies in these SFR tracers, which are\nsensitive to different timescales. Galaxies exhibiting an increasing SFH have\nsystematically higher L$_\\mathrm{TIR}$ and SED-derived SFRs than predicted from\ntheir 1.4 GHz radio luminosity. This indicates that insufficient time has\npassed for subsequent supernovae-driven radio emission to accumulate. We show\nthat backtracking the SFR(t) of galaxies along their SED-derived SFHs to a time\nseveral hundred megayears prior to their observed epoch will both linearise the\nSFR-L$_\\mathrm{1.4GHz}$ relation and reduce the overall scatter. The minimum\nscatter in the SFR(t)-L$_\\mathrm{1.4GHz}$ is reached at 200 - 300 Myr prior,\nconsistent with theoretical predictions for the timescales required to disperse\nthe cosmic ray electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission.",

      "abstract": "Existing molecular canonization algorithms typically operate on\none-dimensional (1D) string representations or two-dimensional (2D)\nconnectivity graphs of a molecule and are not able to differentiate equivalent\natoms based on three-dimensional (3D) structures. The stereochemical tags on\neach atom are in fact determined according to established Cahn-Ingold-Prelog\n(CIP) rules for comparing grades, which can help to further differentiate atoms\nwith similar environment. Therefore, a stereochemical-rule-based canonization\nalgorithm that is capable of assigning canonical indices using 3D structural\ninformation is of great value. On top of the Schneider-Sayle-Landrum (SSL)\npartition-based canonization algorithm, we propose an enhanced canonization\nalgorithm to expand its applicability. The initial index assignment rules are\nredesigned, so that the obtained canonical indices are compatible with the most\nof the common CIP Sequence Rules, which greatly eases the stereochemical\nassignment. Furthermore, a branching tiebreaking step is added to secure an\naccurate evaluation of the structural difference through the minimized\nroot-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between structures, with an option to include\nhydrogen atoms or not. Our algorithm is implemented with Python and can\nefficiently obtain minimized RMSD taking into account of the symmetry of\nmolecular systems , contributing to the fields of drug design, molecular\ndocking, and data analysis of molecular dynamics simulation.",

However, we have observed that\nmulti-view inconsistency between such priors poses a challenge for high-quality\nreconstructions. In response, we present NC-SDF, a neural signed distance field\n(SDF) 3D reconstruction framework with view-dependent normal compensation (NC).\nSpecifically, we integrate view-dependent biases in monocular normal priors\ninto the neural implicit representation of the scene. By adaptively learning\nand correcting the biases, our NC-SDF effectively mitigates the adverse impact\nof inconsistent supervision, enhancing both the global consistency and local\ndetails in the reconstructions. To further refine the details, we introduce an\ninformative pixel sampling strategy to pay more attention to intricate geometry\nwith higher information content. Additionally, we design a hybrid geometry\nmodeling approach to improve the neural implicit representation. Experiments on\nsynthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NC-SDF outperforms existing\napproaches in terms of reconstruction quality.",

And what are the key factors influencing\nlearners' preference to use ChatGPT for academic help-seeking? These relevant\nquestions merit attention. The study employed a mixed-methods research design\nto investigate Taiwanese university students' online academic help-seeking\npreferences. The results indicated that students tend to prefer using ChatGPT\nto seek academic assistance, reflecting the potential popularity of GenAI in\nthe educational field. Additionally, in comparing seven machine learning\nalgorithms, the Random Forest and LightGBM algorithms exhibited superior\nperformance. These two algorithms were employed to evaluate the predictive\ncapability of 18 potential factors. It was found that GenAI fluency, GenAI\ndistortions, and age were the core factors influencing how university students\nseek academic help.

Starting from the Thomson inverse scattering, where\nelectrons do not recoil and photons are back-scattered to higher energies by a\nLorentz boost effect (factor $4\\gamma^2$), we analyze three transition points,\nseparating four regions. These are in sequence, given by increasing the\nelectron recoil (numbers are for transition points, letters for regions): a)\nThomson back-scattering, 1) equal sharing of total energy in the exit channel\nbetween electron and photon, b) deep recoil regime where the bandwidth/energy\nspread of the two interacting beams are exchanged in the exit channel, 2)\nelectron is stopped, i.e. taken down at rest in the laboratory system by\ncolliding with an incident photon of $mc^2/2$ energy, c) electron\nback-scattering region, where incident electron is back-scattered by the\nincident photon, 3) symmetric scattering, when the incident particles carry\nequal and opposite momenta, so that in the exit channel they are back-scattered\nwith same energy/momenta, d) Compton scattering ($a'$ $la$ Arthur Compton, see\nref.4), where photons carry an energy much larger than the colliding electron\nenergy.

Motivated by this problem, we propose a joint CSI\nprediction and predictive selection of the optimal transmitter strategy based\non historical CSI by exploiting the temporal correlation among CSIs. The\nproposed solution utilizes the multi-task learning (MTL) framework by employing\na single Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network architecture that simultaneously\nlearns two tasks of predicting the CSI and selecting the optimal transmitter in\nparallel instead of learning these tasks sequentially. The proposed LSTM\narchitecture outperforms convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture\ndue to its superior ability to capture temporal features in the data. Compared\nto the sequential task learning models, the MTL architecture provides superior\npredicted secrecy performance for a large variation in the number of\ntransmitters and the speed of mobile nodes. It also offers significant\ncomputational and memory efficiency, leading to a substantial saving in\ncomputational time by around 40 percent.",

However, in this paper, we\ndemonstrate that present SOTA concept learning approaches suffer from two major\nproblems - lack of concept fidelity wherein the models fail to learn consistent\nconcepts among similar classes and limited concept interoperability wherein the\nmodels fail to generalize learned concepts to new domains for the same task.\nKeeping these in mind, we propose a novel self-explaining architecture for\nconcept learning across domains which - i) incorporates a new concept saliency\nnetwork for representative concept selection, ii) utilizes contrastive learning\nto capture representative domain invariant concepts, and iii) uses a novel\nprototype-based concept grounding regularization to improve concept alignment\nacross domains.

In this paper, we present a novel\nsystem, called OmniVR, designed to enhance visual clarity during VR navigation.\nOur system enables users to effortlessly locate and zoom in on the objects of\ninterest in VR. It captures user commands for navigation and zoom, converting\nthese inputs into parameters for the Mobius transformation matrix. Leveraging\nthese parameters, the ODI is refined using a learning-based algorithm. The\nresultant ODI is presented within the VR media, effectively reducing blur and\nincreasing user engagement. To verify the effectiveness of our system, we first\nevaluate our algorithm with state-of-the-art methods on public datasets, which\nachieves the best performance. Furthermore, we undertake a comprehensive user\nstudy to evaluate viewer experiences across diverse scenarios and to gather\ntheir qualitative feedback from multiple perspectives. The outcomes reveal that\nour system enhances user engagement by improving the viewers' recognition,\nreducing discomfort, and improving the overall immersive experience. Our system\nmakes the navigation and zoom more user-friendly.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning often involves completing missing\nfactual elements along the timeline. Although existing methods can learn good\nembeddings for each factual element in quadruples by integrating temporal\ninformation, they often fail to infer the evolution of temporal facts. This is\nmainly because of (1) insufficiently exploring the internal structure and\nsemantic relationships within individual quadruples and (2) inadequately\nlearning a unified representation of the contextual and temporal correlations\namong different quadruples. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\nTransformer-based reasoning model (dubbed ECEformer) for TKG to learn the\nEvolutionary Chain of Events (ECE). Specifically, we unfold the neighborhood\nsubgraph of an entity node in chronological order, forming an evolutionary\nchain of events as the input for our model. Subsequently, we utilize a\nTransformer encoder to learn the embeddings of intra-quadruples for ECE. We\nthen craft a mixed-context reasoning module based on the multi-layer perceptron\n(MLP) to learn the unified representations of inter-quadruples for ECE while\naccomplishing temporal knowledge reasoning. In addition, to enhance the\ntimeliness of the events, we devise an additional time prediction task to\ncomplete effective temporal information within the learned unified\nrepresentation. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets verify the\nstate-of-the-art performance and the effectiveness of our method.",

      "abstract": "Distinguished from traditional knowledge graphs (KGs), temporal knowledge\ngraphs (TKGs) must explore and reason over temporally evolving facts\nadequately. However, existing TKG approaches still face two main challenges,\ni.e., the limited capability to model arbitrary timestamps continuously and the\nlack of rich inference patterns under temporal constraints. In this paper, we\npropose an innovative TKGE method (PTBox) via polynomial decomposition-based\ntemporal representation and box embedding-based entity representation to tackle\nthe above-mentioned problems. Specifically, we decompose time information by\npolynomials and then enhance the model's capability to represent arbitrary\ntimestamps flexibly by incorporating the learnable temporal basis tensor. In\naddition, we model every entity as a hyperrectangle box and define each\nrelation as a transformation on the head and tail entity boxes. The entity\nboxes can capture complex geometric structures and learn robust\nrepresentations, improving the model's inductive capability for rich inference\npatterns. Theoretically, our PTBox can encode arbitrary time information or\neven unseen timestamps while capturing rich inference patterns and higher-arity\nrelations of the knowledge base.

However, most audio-text paired datasets often lack rich expression\nof the text data compared to the audio samples. One of the significant\nchallenges facing audio-text datasets is the presence of similar or identical\ncaptions despite different audio samples. Therefore, under many-to-one mapping\nconditions, audio-text datasets lead to poor performance of retrieval tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle the data imbalance problem in\naudio-language retrieval task. To overcome the limitation, we introduce a\nmethod that employs a distance sampling-based paraphraser leveraging ChatGPT,\nutilizing distance function to generate a controllable distribution of\nmanipulated text data. For a set of sentences with the same context, the\ndistance is used to calculate a degree of manipulation for any two sentences,\nand ChatGPT's few-shot prompting is performed using a text cluster with a\nsimilar distance defined by the Jaccard similarity. Therefore, ChatGPT, when\napplied to few-shot prompting with text clusters, can adjust the diversity of\nthe manipulated text based on the distance.

      "abstract": "We quantify the average amount of redundant information that is transferred\nfrom a subset of relevant random source processes to a target process. To\nidentify the relevant source processes, we consider those that are connected to\nthe target process and in addition share a certain proportion of the total\ninformation causally provided to the target. Even if the relevant processes\nhave no directed information exchange between them, they can still causally\nprovide redundant information to the target. This makes it difficult to\nidentify the relevant processes. To solve this issue, we propose the existence\nof a hidden redundancy process that governs the shared information among the\nrelevant processes. We bound the redundancy by the minimal average directed\nredundancy from the relevant processes to the target, from the hidden\nredundancy process to the target, and from the hidden redundancy process to the\nrelevant processes.",

      "abstract": "We measure the broad impact of galaxy structure on galaxy formation by\nexamining the ongoing star formation and integrated star formation history as\nrevealed through the stellar masses of galaxies at $z < 7$ based on JWST CEERS\ndata from the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). Using the morphological catalog of\n3965 visually classified JWST galaxies from Ferreira et al. (2023), we\ninvestigate the evolution of stars, and when they form, as a function of\nmorphological type as well as galaxies classified as passive and starburst\nthrough spectral energy distributions. Although disk galaxies dominate the\nstructures of galaxies at $z < 7$, we find that these disks are in general\neither `passive', or on the main-sequence of star formation, and do not contain\na large population of starburst galaxies. We also find no significant\ncorrelation between morphological type and the star formation rate or colours\nof galaxies at $z < 7$. In fact, we find that the morphologically classified\n`spheroids' tend to be blue and are not found to be predominately passive\nsystems at $z > 1.5$. We also find that the stellar mass function for disk\ngalaxies does not evolve significantly during this time, whereas other galaxy\ntypes, such as the peculiar population, evolve dramatically, declining at lower\nredshifts. This indicates that massive peculiars are more common at higher\nredshifts. We further find that up to $z \\sim 7$, the specific star formation\nrate (sSFR) does not vary with visual morphology, but strongly depends on\nstellar mass and internal galaxy mass density. This demonstrates that at early\nepochs galaxy assembly is a mass-driven, rather than a morphologically-driven,\nprocess. Quenching of star formation is therefore a mass-dominated process\nthroughout the universe's history, likely due to the presence of supermassive\nblack holes.",

      "abstract": "Consistency learning is a central strategy to tackle unlabeled data in\nsemi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS), which enforces the model to\nproduce consistent predictions under the perturbation. However, most current\napproaches solely focus on utilizing a specific single perturbation, which can\nonly cope with limited cases, while employing multiple perturbations\nsimultaneously is hard to guarantee the quality of consistency learning. In\nthis paper, we propose an Adaptive Bidirectional Displacement (ABD) approach to\nsolve the above challenge. Specifically, we first design a bidirectional patch\ndisplacement based on reliable prediction confidence for unlabeled data to\ngenerate new samples, which can effectively suppress uncontrollable regions and\nstill retain the influence of input perturbations. Meanwhile, to enforce the\nmodel to learn the potentially uncontrollable content, a bidirectional\ndisplacement operation with inverse confidence is proposed for the labeled\nimages, which generates samples with more unreliable information to facilitate\nmodel learning. Extensive experiments show that ABD achieves new\nstate-of-the-art performances for SSMIS, significantly improving different\nbaselines. Source code is available at https://github.com/chy-upc/ABD.",

The problem arises from\nthe fact that the traffic loads of sleeping base stations for the next time\nslot cannot be perfectly known, but they can rather be estimated, and any\nestimation error could result in divergence from the optimal decision, which\nsubsequently affects the performance of energy efficiency. The traffic loads of\nthe sleeping base stations for the next time slot are required because the\nswitching decisions are made proactively in the current time slot. Two\ndifferent Q-learning algorithms are developed; one is full-scale, focusing\nsolely on the performance, while the other one is lightweight and addresses the\ncomputational cost. Results confirm that the estimation error is capable of\nchanging cell switching decisions that yields performance divergence compared\nto no-error scenarios. Moreover, the developed Q-learning algorithms perform\nwell since an insignificant difference (i.e., 0.3%) is observed between them\nand the optimum algorithm.",

      "abstract": "We examine the scattering of Ostrovsky wave packets, generated from an\nincident solitary wave, in a two layered waveguide with a delamination in the\ncentre and soft (imperfect) bonding either side of the centre. The layers of\nthe waveguide are assumed to consist of different materials, and the strains\nare described by a system of coupled Boussinesq equations. A semi-analytical\napproach consisting of matched asymptotic multiple-scale expansions is applied,\nleading to Ostrovsky equations in soft bonded regions and Korteweg-de Vries\nequations in the delaminated region. This semi-analytical method has good\nagreement with direct numerical simulations, validating the approach.\n  In the delaminated regions, Ostrovsky wave packets evolve into a train of\nsolitary waves, which subsequently evolve into Ostrovsky wave packets in the\nsecond bonded region. Analysis of the phase shift in the wave packet,\nintroduced from the delaminated region, allows us to predict both the position\nand the length of the delamination; the first time this has been achieved using\nnonlinear waves. These results motivate experiments to validate the theoretical\nresults, with the aim of creating a tool to monitor the integrity of layered\nstructures.",

      "title": "Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems",
      "abstract": "Buildings account for 40 % of global energy consumption. A considerable\nportion of building energy consumption stems from heating, ventilation, and air\nconditioning (HVAC), and thus implementing smart, energy-efficient HVAC systems\nhas the potential to significantly impact the course of climate change. In\nrecent years, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been\nincreasingly assessed for this purpose due to their ability to learn and adapt\npurely from experience. They have been shown to outperform classical\ncontrollers in terms of energy cost and consumption, as well as thermal\ncomfort. However, their weakness lies in their relatively poor data efficiency,\nrequiring long periods of training to reach acceptable policies, making them\ninapplicable to real-world controllers directly. Hence, common research goals\nare to improve the learning speed, as well as to improve their ability to\ngeneralize, in order to facilitate transfer learning to unseen building\nenvironments. In this paper, we take a federated learning approach to training\nthe reinforcement learning controller of an HVAC system. A global control\npolicy is learned by aggregating local policies trained on multiple data\ncenters located in different climate zones. The goal of the policy is to\nsimultaneously minimize energy consumption and maximize thermal comfort. The\nfederated optimization strategy indirectly increases both the rate at which\nexperience data is collected and the variation in the data. We demonstrate\nthrough experimental evaluation that these effects lead to a faster learning\nspeed, as well as greater generalization capabilities in the federated policy\ncompared to any individually trained policy.",

      "abstract": "Social media abounds with multimodal sarcasm, and identifying sarcasm targets\nis particularly challenging due to the implicit incongruity not directly\nevident in the text and image modalities. Current methods for Multimodal\nSarcasm Target Identification (MSTI) predominantly focus on superficial\nindicators in an end-to-end manner, overlooking the nuanced understanding of\nmultimodal sarcasm conveyed through both the text and image. This paper\nproposes a versatile MSTI framework with a coarse-to-fine paradigm, by\naugmenting sarcasm explainability with reasoning and pre-training knowledge.\nInspired by the powerful capacity of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on\nmultimodal reasoning, we first engage LMMs to generate competing rationales for\ncoarser-grained pre-training of a small language model on multimodal sarcasm\ndetection. We then propose fine-tuning the model for finer-grained sarcasm\ntarget identification. Our framework is thus empowered to adeptly unveil the\nintricate targets within multimodal sarcasm and mitigate the negative impact\nposed by potential noise inherently in LMMs. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our model far outperforms state-of-the-art MSTI methods, and markedly\nexhibits explainability in deciphering sarcasm as well.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning-based malware detection systems are vulnerable to adversarial\nEXEmples - carefully-crafted malicious programs that evade detection with\nminimal perturbation. As such, the community is dedicating effort to develop\nmechanisms to defend against adversarial EXEmples. However, current randomized\nsmoothing-based defenses are still vulnerable to attacks that inject blocks of\nadversarial content. In this paper, we introduce a certifiable defense against\npatch attacks that guarantees, for a given executable and an adversarial patch\nsize, no adversarial EXEmple exist. Our method is inspired by (de)randomized\nsmoothing which provides deterministic robustness certificates. During\ntraining, a base classifier is trained using subsets of continguous bytes. At\ninference time, our defense splits the executable into non-overlapping chunks,\nclassifies each chunk independently, and computes the final prediction through\nmajority voting to minimize the influence of injected content. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a preprocessing step that fixes the size of the sections and headers\nto a multiple of the chunk size. As a consequence, the injected content is\nconfined to an integer number of chunks without tampering the other chunks\ncontaining the real bytes of the input examples, allowing us to extend our\ncertified robustness guarantees to content insertion attacks. We perform an\nextensive ablation study, by comparing our defense with randomized\nsmoothing-based defenses against a plethora of content manipulation attacks and\nneural network architectures. Results show that our method exhibits unmatched\nrobustness against strong content-insertion attacks, outperforming randomized\nsmoothing-based defenses in the literature.",

      "abstract": "Federated learning is a promising collaborative and privacy-preserving\nmachine learning approach in data-rich smart cities. Nevertheless, the inherent\nheterogeneity of these urban environments presents a significant challenge in\nselecting trustworthy clients for collaborative model training. The usage of\ntraditional approaches, such as the random client selection technique, poses\nseveral threats to the system's integrity due to the possibility of malicious\nclient selection. Primarily, the existing literature focuses on assessing the\ntrustworthiness of clients, neglecting the crucial aspect of trust in federated\nservers. To bridge this gap, in this work, we propose a novel framework that\naddresses the mutual trustworthiness in federated learning by considering the\ntrust needs of both the client and the server. Our approach entails: (1)\nCreating preference functions for servers and clients, allowing them to rank\neach other based on trust scores, (2) Establishing a reputation-based\nrecommendation system leveraging multiple clients to assess newly connected\nservers, (3) Assigning credibility scores to recommending devices for better\nserver trustworthiness measurement, (4) Developing a trust assessment mechanism\nfor smart devices using a statistical Interquartile Range (IQR) method, (5)\nDesigning intelligent matching algorithms considering the preferences of both\nparties. Based on simulation and experimental results, our approach outperforms\nbaseline methods by increasing trust levels, global model accuracy, and\nreducing non-trustworthy clients in the system.",

      "abstract": "Containerization technology plays a crucial role in Federated Learning (FL)\nsetups, expanding the pool of potential clients and ensuring the availability\nof specific subsets for each learning iteration. However, doubts arise about\nthe trustworthiness of devices deployed as clients in FL scenarios, especially\nwhen container deployment processes are involved. Addressing these challenges\nis important, particularly in managing potentially malicious clients capable of\ndisrupting the learning process or compromising the entire model. In our\nresearch, we are motivated to integrate a trust element into the client\nselection and model deployment processes within our system architecture. This\nis a feature lacking in the initial client selection and deployment mechanism\nof the On-Demand architecture. We introduce a trust mechanism, named\n\"Trusted-On-Demand-FL\", which establishes a relationship of trust between the\nserver and the pool of eligible clients. Utilizing Docker in our deployment\nstrategy enables us to monitor and validate participant actions effectively,\nensuring strict adherence to agreed-upon protocols while strengthening defenses\nagainst unauthorized data access or tampering. Our simulations rely on a\ncontinuous user behavior dataset, deploying an optimization model powered by a\ngenetic algorithm to efficiently select clients for participation. By assigning\ntrust values to individual clients and dynamically adjusting these values,\ncombined with penalizing malicious clients through decreased trust scores, our\nproposed framework identifies and isolates harmful clients.

After\nobtaining the expression for maximal acceleration for different choices of\nRainbow functions, we derive corresponding modifications to Unruh temperature.\nComparing with the observational value of the Unruh temperature, we find the\nupper bound on $\\eta$ as $~10^{32}$ for positron radiation. %and of the order\nof $10^{-100}$ for radiation from a black hole. We then derive geodesic\nequations for different choices of Rainbow functions and also obtain Newtonian\nlimit of these geodesic equations. We find that the changes in the value of\nmaximum acceleration, maximum temperature and Newtonian force equation are\ndependent on the choices of Rainbow functions.",

      "abstract": "Given an ensemble of identical pure quantum states that depend on an unknown\nparameter, recently it was shown that the quantum Fisher information can be\nlosslessly compressed into a subensemble with a much smaller number of samples.\nHowever, generalization to mixed states leads to a technical challenge that is\nformidable to overcome directly. In this work, we avoid such technicality by\nunveiling the physics of a featured lossless post-selection measurement: while\nthe post-selected quantum state is unchanged, the parametric derivative of the\ndensity operator is amplified by a large factor equal to the square root of the\ninverse of the post-selection success probability. This observation not only\nclarifies the intuition and essence of post-selected quantum metrology but also\nallows us to develop a mathematically compact theory for the lossless\npost-selection of mixed states. We find that if the parametric derivative of\nthe density operator of a mixed state, or alternatively the symmetric\nlogarithmic derivative, vanishes on the support of the density matrix, lossless\npost-selection can be achieved with an arbitrarily large amplification factor.\nWe exemplify with the examples of superresolution imaging and unitary encoding\nof mixed initial states.

The theory\nof sparsity was initially built on the notion of shallow minors and on the idea\nof excluding different sets of minors, depending on the depth at which these\nminors can appear.\n  In this paper, we follow a similar path, where shallow vertex minors replace\nshallow minors. In this setting, we provide a neat characterization of stable /\ndependent hereditary classes of graphs: A hereditary class of graphs $\\mathscr\nC$ is\n  (1) dependent if and only if it does not contain all permutation graphs and,\nfor each integer $r$, it excludes some split interval graph as a depth-$r$\nvertex minor;\n  (2) stable if and only if, for each integer $r$, it excludes some half-graph\nas a depth-$r$ vertex minor.\n  A key ingredient in proving these results is the preservation of stability\nand dependence of a class when taking bounded depth shallow vertex minors.

Requirements engineers often need to\ninvolve legal experts who, however, may often not be available. This raises the\nneed for approaches to regulatory Requirements Engineering (RE) covering and\nintegrating both legal and engineering perspectives.\n  Problem: Regulatory RE approaches need to capture and reflect both the\nelementary concepts and relationships from a legal perspective and their\nseamless transition to concepts used to specify software requirements. No\nexisting approach considers explicating and managing legal domain knowledge and\nengineering-legal coordination.\n  Method: We conducted focus group sessions with legal researchers to identify\nthe core challenges to establishing a regulatory RE approach. Based on our\nfindings, we developed a candidate solution and conducted a first conceptual\nvalidation to assess its feasibility.\n  Results: We introduce the first version of our Artifact Model for Regulatory\nRequirements Engineering (AM4RRE) and its conceptual foundation. It provides a\nblueprint for applying legal (modelling) concepts and well-established RE\nconcepts. Our initial results suggest that artifact-centric RE can be applied\nto managing legal domain knowledge and engineering-legal coordination.\n  Conclusions: The focus groups that served as a basis for building our model\nand the results from the expert validation both strengthen our confidence that\nwe already provide a valuable basis for systematically integrating legal\nconcepts into RE.

We assume the code\nto be embedded on the surface of a wide cylinder of height $M$ and\ncircumference $D$ with $M\\ll D$. We demonstrate a power-law divergence of FS\nacross the QPT, and determine the quantum critical points (QCPs) via a\nfinite-size scaling analysis. We verify these results by mapping the perturbed\nKitaev code to the 2D Ising model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor\ninteractions, and computing the single-site magnetization as order parameter\nusing quantum Monte-Carlo technique. We also point out an odd-even dichotomy in\nthe occurrence of the QPT in the Kitaev ladder with respect to the odd and even\nvalues of $D$, when the system is perturbed with only Ising interaction. Our\nresults also indicate a higher robustness of the topological phase of the\nKitaev code against local perturbations if the boundary is made open along one\ndirection. We further consider a local entanglement witness operator designed\nspecifically to capture a lower bound to the localizable entanglement on the\nvertical non-trivial loop of the code.

      "abstract": "As a natural extension to the standard conformal prediction method, several\nconformal risk control methods have been recently developed and applied to\nvarious learning problems. In this work, we seek to control the conformal risk\nin expectation for ordinal classification tasks, which have broad applications\nto many real problems. For this purpose, we firstly formulated the ordinal\nclassification task in the conformal risk control framework, and provided\ntheoretic risk bounds of the risk control method. Then we proposed two types of\nloss functions specially designed for ordinal classification tasks, and\ndeveloped corresponding algorithms to determine the prediction set for each\ncase to control their risks at a desired level. We demonstrated the\neffectiveness of our proposed methods, and analyzed the difference between the\ntwo types of risks on three different datasets, including a simulated dataset,\nthe UTKFace dataset and the diabetic retinopathy detection dataset.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate self-supervised pre-training methods for\ndocument text recognition. Nowadays, large unlabeled datasets can be collected\nfor many research tasks, including text recognition, but it is costly to\nannotate them. Therefore, methods utilizing unlabeled data are researched. We\nstudy self-supervised pre-training methods based on masked label prediction\nusing three different approaches -- Feature Quantization, VQ-VAE, and\nPost-Quantized AE. We also investigate joint-embedding approaches with VICReg\nand NT-Xent objectives, for which we propose an image shifting technique to\nprevent model collapse where it relies solely on positional encoding while\ncompletely ignoring the input image. We perform our experiments on historical\nhandwritten (Bentham) and historical printed datasets mainly to investigate the\nbenefits of the self-supervised pre-training techniques with different amounts\nof annotated target domain data. We use transfer learning as strong baselines.\nThe evaluation shows that the self-supervised pre-training on data from the\ntarget domain is very effective, but it struggles to outperform transfer\nlearning from closely related domains. This paper is one of the first\nresearches exploring self-supervised pre-training in document text recognition,\nand we believe that it will become a cornerstone for future research in this\narea. We made our implementation of the investigated methods publicly available\nat https://github.com/DCGM/pero-pretraining.",

Single-particle and many-body finite-size errors are\ncorrected using canonical-ensemble twist-averaged boundary conditions and\nextrapolation of twist-averaged energies to the thermodynamic limit of infinite\nsystem size. System-size-dependent errors in Slater-Jastrow-backflow DMC\nenergies caused by partially converged VMC energy minimization calculations are\ndiscussed. We find that, for $1 \\leq r_\\text{s} \\leq 5$, optimizing the\nbackflow function at each twist lowers the twist-averaged DMC energy at finite\nsystem size. However, nonsystematic system-size-dependent effects remain in the\nDMC energies, which can be partially removed by extrapolation from multiple\nfinite system sizes to infinite system size. We attribute these nonsystematic\neffects to the close competition between fluid and defected crystal phases at\ndifferent system sizes at low density. The DMC energies in the thermodynamic\nlimit are used to parameterize a local spin density approximation correlation\nfunctional for inhomogeneous electron systems.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by outdated information and a\ntendency to generate incorrect data, commonly referred to as \"hallucinations.\"\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these limitations by combining\nthe strengths of retrieval-based methods and generative models. This approach\ninvolves retrieving relevant information from a large, up-to-date dataset and\nusing it to enhance the generation process, leading to more accurate and\ncontextually appropriate responses. Despite its benefits, RAG introduces a new\nattack surface for LLMs, particularly because RAG databases are often sourced\nfrom public data, such as the web. In this paper, we propose \\TrojRAG{} to\nidentify the vulnerabilities and attacks on retrieval parts (RAG database) and\ntheir indirect attacks on generative parts (LLMs). Specifically, we identify\nthat poisoning several customized content passages could achieve a retrieval\nbackdoor, where the retrieval works well for clean queries but always returns\ncustomized poisoned adversarial queries. Triggers and poisoned passages can be\nhighly customized to implement various attacks. For example, a trigger could be\na semantic group like \"The Republican Party, Donald Trump, etc.\" Adversarial\npassages can be tailored to different contents, not only linked to the triggers\nbut also used to indirectly attack generative LLMs without modifying them.\nThese attacks can include denial-of-service attacks on RAG and semantic\nsteering attacks on LLM generations conditioned by the triggers. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that by just poisoning 10 adversarial passages can\ninduce 98.2\\% success rate to retrieve the adversarial passages. Then, these\npassages can increase the reject ratio of RAG-based GPT-4 from 0.01\\% to 74.6\\%\nor increase the rate of negative responses from 0.22\\% to 72\\% for targeted\nqueries.",

We introduce two multi-dimensional optimization\n(MDO) strategies for adaptive learning: 1) MDO_min, rewarding the current\nlowest dimension score, and 2) MDO_pro, optimizing multiple dimensions similar\nto multi-task learning, resolves conflicting gradients across dimensions\nthrough gradient projection. Unlike prior ROUGE-based rewards relying on\nreference summaries, we use a QA-based reward model that aligns with human\npreferences. Further, we discover the capability to regulate the length of\nsummaries by adjusting the discount factor, seeking the generation of concise\nyet informative summaries that encapsulate crucial points. Our approach\nachieved substantial performance gains compared to baseline models on\nrepresentative summarization datasets, particularly in the overlooked\ndimensions.",

We aim to investigate the\npolarimetric uniqueness of Ch-type asteroids by making databases of various\nobservational quantities (i.e., spectroscopic and photometric properties as\nwell as polarimetric ones) of dark asteroids.Methods. We conducted an intensive\npolarimetric survey of 52 dark asteroids (including 31 Ch-type asteroids) in\nthe R$_\\mathrm{C}$-band to increase the size of polarimetric samples.

We find\nremarkable correlations between these observed quantities, particularly the\ndepth of NPBs and their spectroscopic features associated with the hydrated\nminerals. The amplitude of the opposition effect in photometric properties also\nshows correlations with polarimetric and spectral properties. However, these\nobserved quantities do not show noticeable correlations with the geometric\nalbedo, thermal inertia, and diameter of asteroids. Conclusions.

      "abstract": "Unsupervised skill discovery is a learning paradigm that aims to acquire\ndiverse behaviors without explicit rewards. However, it faces challenges in\nlearning complex behaviors and often leads to learning unsafe or undesirable\nbehaviors. For instance, in various continuous control tasks, current\nunsupervised skill discovery methods succeed in learning basic locomotions like\nstanding but struggle with learning more complex movements such as walking and\nrunning. Moreover, they may acquire unsafe behaviors like tripping and rolling\nor navigate to undesirable locations such as pitfalls or hazardous areas. In\nresponse, we present DoDont (Do's and Don'ts), an instruction-based skill\ndiscovery algorithm composed of two stages. First, in an instruction learning\nstage, DoDont leverages action-free instruction videos to train an instruction\nnetwork to distinguish desirable transitions from undesirable ones. Then, in\nthe skill learning stage, the instruction network adjusts the reward function\nof the skill discovery algorithm to weight the desired behaviors. Specifically,\nwe integrate the instruction network into a distance-maximizing skill discovery\nalgorithm, where the instruction network serves as the distance function.\nEmpirically, with less than 8 instruction videos, DoDont effectively learns\ndesirable behaviors and avoids undesirable ones across complex continuous\ncontrol tasks.

      "abstract": "An increasing number of public datasets have shown a transformative impact on\nautomated medical segmentation. However, these datasets are often with varying\nlabel quality, ranging from manual expert annotations to AI-generated\npseudo-annotations. There is no systematic, reliable, and automatic quality\ncontrol (QC). To fill in this bridge, we introduce a regression model, Quality\nSentinel, to estimate label quality compared with manual annotations in medical\nsegmentation datasets. This regression model was trained on over 4 million\nimage-label pairs created by us. Each pair presents a varying but quantified\nlabel quality based on manual annotations, which enable us to predict the label\nquality of any image-label pairs in the inference. Our Quality Sentinel can\npredict the label quality of 142 body structures. The predicted label quality\nquantified by Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) shares a strong correlation\nwith ground truth quality, with a positive correlation coefficient (r=0.902).\nQuality Sentinel has found multiple impactful use cases. (I) We evaluated label\nquality in publicly available datasets, where quality highly varies across\ndifferent datasets. Our analysis also uncovers that male and younger subjects\nexhibit significantly higher quality. (II) We identified and corrected poorly\nannotated labels, achieving 1/3 reduction in annotation costs with optimal\nbudgeting on TotalSegmentator. (III) We enhanced AI training efficiency and\nperformance by focusing on high-quality pseudo labels, resulting in a 33%--88%\nperformance boost over entropy-based methods, with a cost of 31% time and 4.5%\nmemory.

      "abstract": "Data subsampling is one of the most natural methods to approximate a\nmassively large data set by a small representative proxy. In particular,\nsensitivity sampling received a lot of attention, which samples points\nproportional to an individual importance measure called sensitivity. This\nframework reduces in very general settings the size of data to roughly the VC\ndimension $d$ times the total sensitivity $\\mathfrak S$ while providing strong\n$(1\\pm\\varepsilon)$ guarantees on the quality of approximation. The recent work\nof Woodruff & Yasuda (2023c) improved substantially over the general $\\tilde\nO(\\varepsilon^{-2}\\mathfrak Sd)$ bound for the important problem of $\\ell_p$\nsubspace embeddings to $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-2}\\mathfrak S^{2/p})$ for\n$p\\in[1,2]$. Their result was subsumed by an earlier $\\tilde\nO(\\varepsilon^{-2}\\mathfrak Sd^{1-p/2})$ bound which was implicitly given in\nthe work of Chen & Derezinski (2021). We show that their result is tight when\nsampling according to plain $\\ell_p$ sensitivities.

In particular, this resolves an open\nquestion of Woodruff & Yasuda (2023c) in the affirmative for $p \\in [1,2]$ and\nbrings sensitivity subsampling into the regime that was previously only known\nto be possible using Lewis weights (Cohen & Peng, 2015). As an application of\nour main result, we also obtain an $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-2}\\mu d)$\nsensitivity sampling bound for logistic regression, where $\\mu$ is a natural\ncomplexity measure for this problem.

Typically, a multi-view CMR stack,\ncovering short-axis (SA) and 2/3/4-chamber long-axis (LA) views, is acquired\nfor a thorough cardiac assessment. However, efficiently streamlining the\ncomplex, high-dimensional 3D+T CMR data and distilling compact, coherent\nrepresentation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a whole-heart\nself-supervised learning framework that utilizes masked imaging modeling to\nautomatically uncover the correlations between spatial and temporal patches\nthroughout the cardiac stacks. This process facilitates the generation of\nmeaningful and well-clustered heart representations without relying on the\ntraditionally required, and often costly, labeled data. The learned heart\nrepresentation can be directly used for various downstream tasks. Furthermore,\nour method demonstrates remarkable robustness, ensuring consistent\nrepresentations even when certain CMR planes are missing/flawed. We train our\nmodel on 14,000 unlabeled CMR data from UK BioBank and evaluate it on 1,000\nannotated data. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance to\nbaselines in tasks that demand comprehensive 3D+T cardiac information, e.g.\ncardiac phenotype (ejection fraction and ventricle volume) prediction and\nmulti-plane/multi-frame CMR segmentation, highlighting its effectiveness in\nextracting comprehensive cardiac features that are both anatomically and\npathologically relevant.",

      "abstract": "The adaptation and use of Machine Learning (ML) in our daily lives has led to\nconcerns in lack of transparency, privacy, reliability, among others. As a\nresult, we are seeing research in niche areas such as interpretability,\ncausality, bias and fairness, and reliability. In this survey paper, we focus\non a critical concern for adaptation of ML in risk-sensitive applications,\nnamely understanding and quantifying uncertainty. Our paper approaches this\ntopic in a structured way, providing a review of the literature in the various\nfacets that uncertainty is enveloped in the ML process. We begin by defining\nuncertainty and its categories (e.g., aleatoric and epistemic), understanding\nsources of uncertainty (e.g., data and model), and how uncertainty can be\nassessed in terms of uncertainty quantification techniques (Ensembles, Bayesian\nNeural Networks, etc.). As part of our assessment and understanding of\nuncertainty in the ML realm, we cover metrics for uncertainty quantification\nfor a single sample, dataset, and metrics for accuracy of the uncertainty\nestimation itself. This is followed by discussions on calibration (model and\nuncertainty), and decision making under uncertainty. Thus, we provide a more\ncomplete treatment of uncertainty: from the sources of uncertainty to the\ndecision-making process. We have focused the review of uncertainty\nquantification methods on Deep Learning (DL), while providing the necessary\nbackground for uncertainty discussion within ML in general. Key contributions\nin this review are broadening the scope of uncertainty discussion, as well as\nan updated review of uncertainty quantification methods in DL.",

As the scale and complexity of features in\nindustrial scenarios increase, deep uplift modeling (DUM) as a promising\ntechnique has attracted increased research from academia and industry,\nresulting in various predictive models. However, current DUM still lacks some\nstandardized benchmarks and unified evaluation protocols, which limit the\nreproducibility of experimental results in existing studies and the practical\nvalue and potential impact in this direction. In this paper, we provide an open\nbenchmark for DUM and present comparison results of existing models in a\nreproducible and uniform manner. To this end, we conduct extensive experiments\non two representative industrial datasets with different preprocessing settings\nto re-evaluate 13 existing models. Surprisingly, our experimental results show\nthat the most recent work differs less than expected from traditional work in\nmany cases. In addition, our experiments also reveal the limitations of DUM in\ngeneralization, especially for different preprocessing and test distributions.\nOur benchmarking work allows researchers to evaluate the performance of new\nmodels quickly but also reasonably demonstrates fair comparison results with\nexisting models. It also gives practitioners valuable insights into often\noverlooked considerations when deploying DUM.

The well-established\nindirect formulation of minimum-time orbit transfers is extended to a multibody\ndynamical framework, with initial and final orbits around two distinct\nprimaries. To do this, different representations, useful for describing orbit\ndynamics, are introduced, i.e., modified equinoctial elements (MEE) and\nCartesian coordinates (CC). Use of two sets of MEE, relative to either Earth or\nMoon, allows simple writing of the boundary conditions about the two celestial\nbodies, but requires the formulation of a multiple-arc trajectory optimization\nproblem, including two legs: (a) geocentric leg and (b) selenocentric leg. In\nthe numerical solution process, the transition between the two MEE\nrepresentations uses CC, which play the role of convenient intermediate,\nmatching variables. The multiple-arc formulation at hand leads to identifying a\nset of intermediate necessary conditions for optimality, at the transition\nbetween the two legs. This research proves that a closed-form solution to these\nintermediate conditions exists, leveraging implicit costate transformation. As\na result, the parameter set for an indirect algorithm retains the reduced size\nof the typical set associated with a single-arc optimization problem. The\nindirect heuristic technique, based on the joint use of the necessary\nconditions and a heuristic algorithm (i.e., differential evolution in this\nstudy) is proposed as the numerical solution method, together with the\ndefinition of a layered fitness function, aimed at facilitating convergence.\nThe minimum-time trajectory of interest is sought in a high-fidelity dynamical\nframework, with the use of planetary ephemeris and the inclusion of the\nsimultaneous gravitational action of Sun, Earth, and Moon, along the entire\ntransfer path.",

      "abstract": "Health information-seeking behaviors are critical for individuals managing\nillnesses, especially in cases like hemifacial spasm (HFS), a condition\nfamiliar to specialists but not to general practitioners and the broader\npublic. The limited awareness of HFS often leads to scarce online resources for\nself-diagnosis and a heightened risk of misdiagnosis. In China, the imbalance\nin the doctor-to-patient ratio and HFS's low incidence exacerbate information\nand power asymmetries within doctor-patient relationship. While HCI and CSCW\nresearch predominantly focuses on more common chronic conditions, our study\ndelves into HFS, aiming to deepen the understanding of HFS patients' health\ninformation-seeking journeys in China, as well as exploring how these patients\nutilize various stakeholders and online resources to overcome asymmetries in\nthe doctor-patient relationship and access top-tier medical resources. Through\ninterviews with three neurosurgeons and 12 HFS patients from both rural and\nurban areas, and applying Actor-Network Theory, we offer empirical insights\ninto the interactions and workflows within the health information-seeking\nnetwork. Our analysis identified five strategies HFS patients adopted to access\ntop-tier medical resources. We also propose design opportunities for technology\nto aid patients in overcoming the challenges encountered during their health\ninformation-seeking journey.",

We develop a novel algorithm for sampling rows $a_i$ of a matrix\n$A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$, proportional to their $\\ell_p$ norm, when $A$ is\npresented in a turnstile data stream. Our algorithm not only returns the set of\nsampled row indexes, it also returns slightly perturbed rows $\\tilde{a}_i\n\\approx a_i$, and approximates their sampling probabilities up to $\\varepsilon$\nrelative error. When combined with preconditioning techniques, our algorithm\nextends to $\\ell_p$ leverage score sampling over turnstile data streams. With\nthese properties in place, it allows us to simulate subsampling constructions\nof coresets for important regression problems to operate over turnstile data\nstreams with very little overhead compared to their respective off-line\nsubsampling algorithms.

      "abstract": "Cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of global disability\nand mortality. Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as\nthe golden standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow\nand reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore,\nprecise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between\ntheir main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately\nquantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences\nremains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and\nambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of\npublicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we\nintroduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the\nfirst publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level\nsemantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a\nspatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing\nDSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet\nintroduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel\ndetails across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and\nimprove vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture\nglobal context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we\ndevelop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial\nand temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving\na Dice of 0.9033.",

      "abstract": "The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications\npresents both opportunities and challenges, particularly in multilingual and\ncode-mixed communication settings. This research evaluates the performance of\nseven leading LLMs in sentiment analysis on a dataset derived from multilingual\nand code-mixed WhatsApp chats, including Swahili, English and Sheng. Our\nevaluation includes both quantitative analysis using metrics like F1 score and\nqualitative assessment of LLMs' explanations for their predictions. We find\nthat, while Mistral-7b and Mixtral-8x7b achieved high F1 scores, they and other\nLLMs such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama-2-70b, and Gemma-7b struggled with\nunderstanding linguistic and contextual nuances, as well as lack of\ntransparency in their decision-making process as observed from their\nexplanations. In contrast, GPT-4 and GPT-4-Turbo excelled in grasping diverse\nlinguistic inputs and managing various contextual information, demonstrating\nhigh consistency with human alignment and transparency in their decision-making\nprocess. The LLMs however, encountered difficulties in incorporating cultural\nnuance especially in non-English settings with GPT-4s doing so inconsistently.\nThe findings emphasize the necessity of continuous improvement of LLMs to\neffectively tackle the challenges of culturally nuanced, low-resource\nreal-world settings and the need for developing evaluation benchmarks for\ncapturing these issues.",

      "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated impressive\nzero-shot capabilities for various downstream tasks. Their performance can be\nfurther enhanced through few-shot prompt tuning methods. However, current\nstudies evaluate the performance of learned prompts separately on base and new\nclasses. This evaluation lacks practicality for real-world applications since\ndownstream tasks cannot determine whether the data belongs to base or new\nclasses in advance. In this paper, we explore a problem setting called\nOpen-world Prompt Tuning (OPT), which involves tuning prompts on base classes\nand evaluating on a combination of base and new classes. By introducing\nDecomposed Prompt Tuning framework (DePT), we theoretically demonstrate that\nOPT can be solved by incorporating out-of-distribution detection into prompt\ntuning, thereby enhancing the base-to-new discriminability. Based on DePT, we\npresent a novel prompt tuning approach, namely, Decomposed Context Optimization\n(DeCoOp), which introduces new-class detectors and sub-classifiers to further\nenhance the base-class and new-class discriminability. Experimental results on\n11 benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of DePT and demonstrate that\nDeCoOp outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, providing a significant 2%\naverage accuracy improvement.",

In this\nwork, based on the first-principles calculations, we propose a new way of\nhydrogenation to realize metalization. Using the fully anisotropic\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory, we investigate the superconducting behaviors in the\nstable monolayers LiBCH and LiCBH, in which C and B atoms are hydrogenated,\nrespectively. Our findings indicate that the monolayers possess the high\n$T_{c}$ of 82.0 and 82.5 K, respectively, along with the interesting three-gap\nsuperconducting natures. The Fermi sheets showing the obvious three-region\ndistribution characteristics and the abnormally strong electron-phonon coupling\n(EPC) are responsible for the high-$T_{c}$ three-gap superconductivity.\nFurthermore, the $T_{c}$ can be dramatically boosted up to 120.0 K under 3.5 \\%\ntensile strain. To a great extent, the high $T_{c}$ is beyond the liquid\nnitrogen temperature ($77$ K), which is beneficial for the applications in\nfuture experiments. This study not only explores the superconducting properties\nof the monolayers LiBCH and LiCBH, but also offers practical insights into the\nsearch for high-$T_{c}$ superconductors.",

Existing deep reinforcement\nlearning-based methods, while benefiting from visual or operational priors,\noften struggle with small-batch precise assembly tasks due to their reliance on\ninsufficient priors and high-costed model development. To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces a cognitive manipulation and learning\napproach that utilizes skill graphs to integrate learning-based object\ndetection with fine manipulation models into a cohesive modular policy. This\napproach enables the detection of the master object from both global and local\nperspectives to accommodate positional uncertainties and variable backgrounds,\nand parametric residual policy to handle pose error and intricate contact\ndynamics effectively. Leveraging the skill graph, our method supports\nknowledge-informed learning of semi-supervised learning for object detection\nand classroom-to-real reinforcement learning for fine manipulation. Simulation\nexperiments on a gear-assembly task have demonstrated that the\nskill-graph-enabled coarse-operation planning and visual attention are\nessential for efficient learning and robust manipulation, showing substantial\nimprovements of 13$\\%$ in success rate and 15.4$\\%$ in number of completion\nsteps over competing methods.

In contrast, the\nTransformer requires less execution time due to its parallel processing nature.\nIn this work, we introduce a novel hybrid deep learning model, RoBERTa-BiLSTM,\nwhich combines the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) with\nBidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. RoBERTa is utilized to\ngenerate meaningful word embedding vectors, while BiLSTM effectively captures\nthe contextual semantics of long-dependent texts. The RoBERTa-BiLSTM hybrid\nmodel leverages the strengths of both sequential and Transformer models to\nenhance performance in sentiment analysis. We conducted experiments using\ndatasets from IMDb, Twitter US Airline, and Sentiment140 to evaluate the\nproposed model against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental\nfindings demonstrate that the RoBERTa-BiLSTM model surpasses baseline models\n(e.g., BERT, RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-GRU, and RoBERTa-LSTM), achieving accuracies\nof 80.74%, 92.36%, and 82.25% on the Twitter US Airline, IMDb, and Sentiment140\ndatasets, respectively. Additionally, the model achieves F1-scores of 80.73%,\n92.35%, and 82.25% on the same datasets, respectively.",

In response, we\ndeveloped a new spatiotemporal method that effectively handles such randomly\nsampled data. Our model integrates techniques from amortized variational\ninference, neural differential equations, neural point processes, and implicit\nneural representations to predict both the dynamics of the system and the\nprobabilistic locations and timings of future observations. It outperforms\nexisting methods on challenging spatiotemporal datasets by offering substantial\nimprovements in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a\nuseful tool for modeling and understanding complex dynamical systems observed\nunder realistic, unconstrained conditions.",

      "abstract": "To control structural responses under various actions, the growing use of\nsupplementary damping systems in modern civil engineering structures\nnecessitates inspecting and evaluating their operational performance\npostinstallation. However, due to the dispersed placement and complex\nnonlinearities of these devices, difficulties arise in determining minimal\nsensor configuration. This is inherently connected to a pivotal challenge:\nestablishing a reliable input-output mapping, which comprises both the\nmathematical model and sensor arrangements. Prior work indicates this can be\nachieved through theoretical observability analysis or Lie symmetries analysis,\nboth of which provide different perspectives on the existence of a way to\naccess the solutions of a system identification problem uniquely (at least\nlocally). The present study introduces a unified framework, enhanced by\nalgorithm realization as an application guide, for analyzing the observability\nand Lie symmetries of a given input-output mapping. We demonstrate its\nimplementation via examples of a building structure with various damping\nsystems under different conditions such as seismic loads, wind loads, and\noperational vibrations. Finally, we present a case study for an isolation\nbuilding with an inerter damper and minimal sensor arrangement under seismic\naction. The results demonstrate that the unscented Kalman filter, a system\nidentification method, can precisely estimate structural responses and assess\ndamping device performance once a reliable input-output mapping is established.",

Our approach and the perturbative QCD approach (PQCD) adopt\nthe compatible theme to deal with the resonance contributions. What's more, our\ndata for the intermediate two-body charmed $B$-meson decays in FAT approach are\nmore precise.

      "abstract": "Purpose: Analysis of [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) kinetics in cancer has\nbeen most often limited to the evaluation of the average uptake over relatively\nlarge volumes. Nevertheless, tumor lesion almost contains inflammatory\ninfiltrates whose cells are characterized by a significant radioactivity\nwashout due to the hydrolysis of FDG-6P catalyzed by glucose-6P phosphatase.\nThe present study aimed to verify whether voxel-wise compartmental analysis of\ndynamic imaging can identify tumor regions characterized by tracer washout.\nMaterials & Methods: The study included 11 patients with lung cancer submitted\nto PET/CT imaging for staging purposes. Tumor was defined by drawing a volume\nof interest loosely surrounding the lesion and considering all inside voxels\nwith standardized uptake value (SUV) >40% of the maximum. After 20 minutes\ndynamic imaging centered on the heart, eight whole body scans were repeated.\nSix parametric maps were progressively generated by computing six regression\nlines that considered all eight frames, the last seven ones, and so on, up to\nthe last three. Results: Progressively delaying the starting point of\nregression line computation identified a progressive increase in the prevalence\nof voxels with a negative slope. Conclusions: The voxel-wise parametric maps\nprovided by compartmental analysis permits to identify a measurable volume\ncharacterized by radioactivity washout. The spatial localization of this\npattern is compatible with the recognized preferential site of inflammatory\ninfiltrates populating the tumor stroma and might improve the power of FDG\nimaging in monitoring the effectiveness of treatments aimed to empower the host\nimmune response against the cancer.",

      "abstract": "The amplification of high-speed micro-motions holds significant promise, with\napplications spanning fault detection in fast-paced industrial environments to\nrefining precision in medical procedures. However, conventional motion\nmagnification algorithms often encounter challenges in high-speed scenarios due\nto low sampling rates or motion blur. In recent years, spike cameras have\nemerged as a superior alternative for visual tasks in such environments, owing\nto their unique capability to capture temporal and spatial frequency domains\nwith exceptional fidelity. Unlike conventional cameras, which operate at fixed,\nlow frequencies, spike cameras emulate the functionality of the retina,\nasynchronously capturing photon changes at each pixel position using spike\nstreams. This innovative approach comprehensively records temporal and spatial\nvisual information, rendering it particularly suitable for magnifying\nhigh-speed micro-motions.This paper introduces SpikeMM, a pioneering\nspike-based algorithm tailored specifically for high-speed motion\nmagnification. SpikeMM integrates multi-level information extraction, spatial\nupsampling, and motion magnification modules, offering a self-supervised\napproach adaptable to a wide range of scenarios. Notably, SpikeMM facilitates\nseamless integration with high-performance super-resolution and motion\nmagnification algorithms. We substantiate the efficacy of SpikeMM through\nrigorous validation using scenes captured by spike cameras, showcasing its\ncapacity to magnify motions in real-world high-frequency settings.",

      "abstract": "Conventional 2D pose estimation models are constrained by their design to\nspecific object categories. This limits their applicability to predefined\nobjects. To overcome these limitations, category-agnostic pose estimation\n(CAPE) emerged as a solution. CAPE aims to facilitate keypoint localization for\ndiverse object categories using a unified model, which can generalize from\nminimal annotated support images. Recent CAPE works have produced object poses\nbased on arbitrary keypoint definitions annotated on a user-provided support\nimage. Our work departs from conventional CAPE methods, which require a support\nimage, by adopting a text-based approach instead of the support image.\nSpecifically, we use a pose-graph, where nodes represent keypoints that are\ndescribed with text. This representation takes advantage of the abstraction of\ntext descriptions and the structure imposed by the graph.\n  Our approach effectively breaks symmetry, preserves structure, and improves\nocclusion handling. We validate our novel approach using the MP-100 benchmark,\na comprehensive dataset spanning over 100 categories and 18,000 images. Under a\n1-shot setting, our solution achieves a notable performance boost of 1.07\\%,\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art for CAPE.

      "abstract": "Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons are an interesting complementary model for\nintegrator neurons in spiking neural networks (SNNs). Due to their resonating\nmembrane dynamics they can extract frequency patterns within the time domain.\nWhile established RF variants suffer from intrinsic shortcomings, the recently\nproposed balanced resonate-and-fire (BRF) neuron marked a significant\nmethodological advance in terms of task performance, spiking and parameter\nefficiency, as well as, general stability and robustness, demonstrated for\nrecurrent SNNs in various sequence learning tasks. One of the most intriguing\nresult, however, was an immense improvement in training convergence speed and\nsmoothness, overcoming the typical convergence dilemma in backprop-based SNN\ntraining. This paper aims at providing further intuitions about how and why\nthese convergence advantages emerge. We show that BRF neurons, in contrast to\nwell-established ALIF neurons, span a very clean and smooth - almost convex -\nerror landscape. Furthermore, empirical results reveal that the convergence\nbenefits are predominantly coupled with a divergence boundary-aware\noptimization, a major component of the BRF formulation that addresses the\nnumerical stability of the time-discrete resonator approximation. These results\nare supported by a formal investigation of the membrane dynamics indicating\nthat the gradient is transferred back through time without loss of magnitude.",

      "abstract": "The integration of observational data into numerical models, known as data\nassimilation (DA), is fundamental for making Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)\npossible, with breathtaking success over the past 60 years (Bauer et al. 2015).\nTraditional DA methods, such as variational techniques and ensemble Kalman\nfilters, are basic pillars of current NWP by incorporating diverse\nobservational data. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)\npresents new opportunities for further improvements. AI-based approaches can\nemulate the complex computations of traditional NWP models at a reduced\ncomputational cost, offering the potential to speed up and improve analyses and\nforecasts dramatically (e.g. Pathak et al., 2022; Bi et al., 2023; Lam et al.,\n2023; Bouallegue et al., 2023). AI itself plays a growing role in optimization\n(e.g. Fan et al., 2024), which offers new possibilities also beyond model\nemulation. In this paper, we introduce a novel AI-based variational DA approach\ndesigned to replace classical methods of DA by leveraging deep learning\ntechniques. Unlike previous hybrid approaches, our method integrates the DA\nprocess directly into a neural network, utilizing the variational DA framework.\nThis innovative AI-based system, termed AI-Var, employs a neural network\ntrained to minimize the variational cost function, enabling it to perform DA\nwithout relying on pre-existing analysis datasets. We present a\nproof-of-concept implementation of this approach, demonstrating its feasibility\nthrough a series of idealized and real-world test cases. Our results indicate\nthat the AI-Var system can efficiently assimilate observations and produce\naccurate initial conditions for NWP, highlighting its potential to carry out\nthe DA process in weather forecasting.

Researchers and practitioners have developed and relied on\nartificial intelligence techniques to collect, process, and analyze documents\nin the legal field, especially for tasks such as text summarization and\nclassification. While increasing procedural efficiency is often the primary\nmotivation behind natural language processing in the field, several works have\nproposed solutions for human rights-related issues, such as assessment of\npublic policy and institutional social settings. One such issue is the presence\nof gender biases in court decisions, which has been largely studied in social\nsciences fields; biased institutional responses to gender-based violence are a\nviolation of international human rights dispositions since they prevent gender\nminorities from accessing rights and hamper their dignity. Natural language\nprocessing-based approaches can help detect these biases on a larger scale.\nStill, the development and use of such tools require researchers and\npractitioners to be mindful of legal and ethical aspects concerning data\nsharing and use, reproducibility, domain expertise, and value-charged choices.\nIn this work, we (a) present an experimental framework developed to\nautomatically detect gender biases in court decisions issued in Brazilian\nPortuguese and (b) describe and elaborate on features we identify to be\ncritical in such a technology, given its proposed use as a support tool for\nresearch and assessment of court~activity.",

      "abstract": "The need for modelling causal knowledge at different levels of granularity\narises in several settings. Causal Abstraction provides a framework for\nformalizing this problem by relating two Structural Causal Models at different\nlevels of detail. Despite increasing interest in applying causal abstraction,\ne.g. in the interpretability of large machine learning models, the graphical\nand parametrical conditions under which a causal model can abstract another are\nnot known. Furthermore, learning causal abstractions from data is still an open\nproblem. In this work, we tackle both issues for linear causal models with\nlinear abstraction functions. First, we characterize how the low-level\ncoefficients and the abstraction function determine the high-level coefficients\nand how the high-level model constrains the causal ordering of low-level\nvariables. Then, we apply our theoretical results to learn high-level and\nlow-level causal models and their abstraction function from observational data.\nIn particular, we introduce Abs-LiNGAM, a method that leverages the constraints\ninduced by the learned high-level model and the abstraction function to speedup\nthe recovery of the larger low-level model, under the assumption of\nnon-Gaussian noise terms. In simulated settings, we show the effectiveness of\nlearning causal abstractions from data and the potential of our method in\nimproving scalability of causal discovery.",

      "abstract": "The radiative branching ratio of the Hoyle state is crucial to estimate the\ntriple-$\\alpha$ reaction rate in stellar environments at medium temperatures.\nKnowledge of the $\\gamma$-decay channel is critical as this is the dominant\nradiative decay channel for the Hoyle state. A recent study by Kib\\'edi et al.\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 182701 (2020)] has challenged our understanding of this\nastrophysically significant branching ratio and its constraints. The objective\nof this work was to perform a new measurement of the $\\gamma$-decay branching\nratio of the Hoyle state to deduce the radiative branching ratio of the Hoyle\nstate. An additional objective was to independently verify aspects of the\naforementioned measurement conducted by Kib\\'edi et al. For the main experiment\nof this work, the Hoyle state was populated by the $^{12}\\textrm{C}(p,p')$\nreaction at 10.8 MeV at the Oslo Cyclotron Laboratory. The $\\gamma$-decay\nbranching ratio was deduced through triple-coincidence events, each consisting\nof a proton ejectile corresponding to the Hoyle state, and the subsequent\n$\\gamma$-ray cascade. In the main experiment of this work, a $\\gamma$-decay\nbranching ratio of the Hoyle state of $\\Gamma_{\\gamma}/\\Gamma=4.0(4)\\times\n10^{-4}$ was determined, yielding a corresponding radiative branching ratio of\n$\\Gamma_{\\textrm{rad}}/\\Gamma=4.1(4) \\times 10^{-4}$, which is in agreement\nwith several recent studies, as well as the previously adopted ENSDF average of\n$\\Gamma_{\\textrm{rad}}/\\Gamma=4.16(11)\\times 10^{-4}$. Aspects of the analysis\nperformed by Kib\\'edi et al. were verified in this work and the source of\ndiscrepancy between the results of this work and that of Kib\\'edi et al. could\nnot be determined. Further independent and innovative studies for the radiative\nwidth of the Hoyle state will substantiate whether the discrepant result by\nKib\\'edi et al. should be excluded from future evaluations.",

On the other hand, we characterize the property of\nblock diagonal dynamics along the heteroclinic connections that allows these\nchains to be shadowed, a property which in general only holds for transversal\nheteroclinic connections. Due to the lack of transversality, only finite chains\nare shadowed, since there is a dropping dimensions mechanism in the evolution\nof any disk close to them.

      "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is a popular method for leaning graph\nrepresentations by maximizing the consistency of features across augmented\nviews. Traditional GCL methods utilize single-perspective i.e. data or\nmodel-perspective) augmentation to generate positive samples, restraining the\ndiversity of positive samples. In addition, these positive samples may be\nunreliable due to uncontrollable augmentation strategies that potentially alter\nthe semantic information. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a\ninnovative framework termed dual-perspective cross graph contrastive learning\n(DC-GCL), which incorporates three modifications designed to enhance positive\nsample diversity and reliability: 1) We propose dual-perspective augmentation\nstrategy that provide the model with more diverse training data, enabling the\nmodel effective learning of feature consistency across different views. 2) From\nthe data perspective, we slightly perturb the original graphs using\ncontrollable data augmentation, effectively preserving their semantic\ninformation. 3) From the model perspective, we enhance the encoder by utilizing\nmore powerful graph transformers instead of graph neural networks. Based on the\nmodel's architecture, we propose three pruning-based strategies to slightly\nperturb the encoder, providing more reliable positive samples. These\nmodifications collectively form the DC-GCL's foundation and provide more\ndiverse and reliable training inputs, offering significant improvements over\ntraditional GCL methods. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks\ndemonstrate that DC-GCL consistently outperforms different baselines on various\ndatasets and tasks.",

      "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emulate the integrated-fire-leak mechanism\nfound in biological neurons, offering a compelling combination of biological\nrealism and energy efficiency. In recent years, they have gained considerable\nresearch interest. However, existing SNNs predominantly rely on the Leaky\nIntegrate-and-Fire (LIF) model and are primarily suited for simple, static\ntasks. They lack the ability to effectively model long-term temporal\ndependencies and facilitate spatial information interaction, which is crucial\nfor tackling complex, dynamic spatio-temporal prediction tasks. To tackle these\nchallenges, this paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses\nin biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model. The STC\nmodel integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking\nneurons' temporal memory and spatial coordination. We conduct a theoretical\nanalysis of the dynamic parameters in the STC model, highlighting their\ncontribution in establishing long-term memory and mitigating the issue of\ngradient vanishing. Through extensive experiments on multiple spatio-temporal\nprediction datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other adaptive\nmodels. Furthermore, our model is compatible with existing spiking neuron\nmodels, thereby augmenting their dynamic representations. In essence, our work\nenriches the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.",

(2006)\nusing a computer simulation, inspired by similar work done in the past by\nObront (2021) for the DNA computing algorithm developed by Adleman (1994) for\nsolving the Hamiltonian path problem. We develop a Python program to simulate\nthe logical operations involved in the DNA-based Boolean matrix multiplication\nalgorithm. The simulation replicates the key steps of the algorithm, including\nDNA sequence generation and hybridization, without imitating the physical\nbehaviour of the DNA molecules. It is intended to serve as a basic prototype\nfor larger, more comprehensive DNA computing simulators that can be used as\neducational or research tools in the future. Through this work, we aim to\ncontribute to the understanding of DNA-based computing paradigms and their\npotential advantages and trade-offs compared to conventional computing systems,\npaving the way for future research and advancements in this emerging field.",

      "abstract": "It has been verified that deep learning methods, including convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and transformers, can\naccurately extract features from hyperspectral images (HSIs). These algorithms\nperform exceptionally well on HSIs change detection (HSIs-CD). However, the\ndownside of these impressive results is the enormous number of parameters,\nFLOPs, GPU memory, training and test times required. In this paper, we propose\nan spectral Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for HSIs-CD (SpectralKAN). SpectralKAN\nrepresent a multivariate continuous function with a composition of activation\nfunctions to extract HSIs feature and classification. These activation\nfunctions are b-spline functions with different parameters that can simulate\nvarious functions. In SpectralKAN, a KAN encoder is proposed to enhance\ncomputational efficiency for HSIs. And a spatial-spectral KAN encoder is\nintroduced, where the spatial KAN encoder extracts spatial features and\ncompresses the spatial dimensions from patch size to one. The spectral KAN\nencoder then extracts spectral features and classifies them into changed and\nunchanged categories. We use five HSIs-CD datasets to verify the effectiveness\nof SpectralKAN. Experimental verification has shown that SpectralKAN maintains\nhigh HSIs-CD accuracy while requiring fewer parameters, FLOPs, GPU memory,\ntraining and testing times, thereby increasing the efficiency of HSIs-CD.

      "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the problem of adapting to the presence or\nabsence of causal structure in multi-armed bandit problems. In addition to the\nusual reward signal, we assume the learner has access to additional variables,\nobserved in each round after acting. When these variables $d$-separate the\naction from the reward, existing work in causal bandits demonstrates that one\ncan achieve strictly better (minimax) rates of regret (Lu et al., 2020). Our\ngoal is to adapt to this favorable \"conditionally benign\" structure, if it is\npresent in the environment, while simultaneously recovering worst-case minimax\nregret, if it is not. Notably, the learner has no prior knowledge of whether\nthe favorable structure holds. In this paper, we establish the Pareto optimal\nfrontier of adaptive rates. We prove upper and matching lower bounds on the\npossible trade-offs in the performance of learning in conditionally benign and\narbitrary environments, resolving an open question raised by Bilodeau et al.\n(2022). Furthermore, we are the first to obtain instance-dependent bounds for\ncausal bandits, by reducing the problem to the linear bandit setting. Finally,\nwe examine the common assumption that the marginal distributions of the\npost-action contexts are known and show that a nontrivial estimate is necessary\nfor better-than-worst-case minimax rates.",

This work addresses the problem of\nreassigning passengers to specific time slots for crossing security, aiming to\nmitigate these inefficiencies. We frame this problem as a Minimum Cost Network\nFlow (MCNF) problem, enabling us to solve it exactly in polynomial time due to\nits linear programming structure. Our approach redistributes passenger demand\nacross different time intervals. By optimizing the reassignment of passengers\nto sigma-minute time slots, we achieve significant improvements in throughput\nand reductions in waiting time.

      "title": "SplitLoRA: A Split Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Framework for Large\n  Language Models",
      "abstract": "The scalability of large language models (LLMs) in handling high-complexity\nmodels and large-scale datasets has led to tremendous successes in pivotal\ndomains. While there is an urgent need to acquire more training data for LLMs,\na concerning reality is the depletion of high-quality public datasets within a\nfew years. In view of this, the federated learning (FL) LLM fine-tuning\nparadigm recently has been proposed to facilitate collaborative LLM fine-tuning\non distributed private data, where multiple data owners collaboratively\nfine-tune a shared LLM without sharing raw data. However, the staggering model\nsize of LLMs imposes heavy computing and communication burdens on clients,\nposing significant barriers to the democratization of the FL LLM fine-tuning\nparadigm. To address this issue, split learning (SL) has emerged as a promising\nsolution by offloading the primary training workload to a server via model\npartitioning while exchanging activation/activation's gradients with smaller\ndata sizes rather than the entire LLM. Unfortunately, research on the SL LLM\nfine-tuning paradigm is still in its nascent stage. To fill this gap, in this\npaper, we propose the first SL LLM fine-tuning framework, named SplitLoRA.\nSplitLoRA is built on the split federated learning (SFL) framework,\namalgamating the advantages of parallel training from FL and model splitting\nfrom SL and thus greatly enhancing the training efficiency. It is worth noting\nthat SplitLoRA is the inaugural open-source benchmark for SL LLM fine-tuning,\nproviding a foundation for research efforts dedicated to advancing SL LLM\nfine-tuning. Extensive simulations validate that SplitLoRA achieves target\naccuracy in significantly less time than state-of-the-art LLM fine-tuning\nframeworks, demonstrating the superior training performance of SplitLoRA.

      "abstract": "Edge-device co-inference, which concerns the cooperation between edge devices\nand an edge server for completing inference tasks over wireless networks, has\nbeen a promising technique for enabling various kinds of intelligent services\nat the network edge, e.g., auto-driving. In this paradigm, the concerned design\nobjective of the network shifts from the traditional communication throughput\nto the effective and efficient execution of the inference task underpinned by\nthe network, measured by, e.g., the inference accuracy and latency. In this\npaper, a task-oriented over-the-air computation scheme is proposed for a\nmultidevice artificial intelligence system. Particularly, a novel tractable\ninference accuracy metric is proposed for classification tasks, which is called\nminimum pair-wise discriminant gain. Unlike prior work measuring the average of\nall class pairs in feature space, it measures the minimum distance of all class\npairs. By maximizing the minimum pair-wise discriminant gain instead of its\naverage counterpart, any pair of classes can be better separated in the feature\nspace, and thus leading to a balanced and improved inference accuracy for all\nclasses. Besides, this paper jointly optimizes the minimum discriminant gain of\nall feature elements instead of separately maximizing that of each element in\nthe existing designs. As a result, the transmit power can be adaptively\nallocated to the feature elements according to their different contributions to\nthe inference accuracy, opening an extra degree of freedom to improve inference\nperformance. Extensive experiments are conducted using a concrete use case of\nhuman motion recognition to verify the superiority of the proposed design over\nthe benchmarking scheme.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been significant progress in semantic\ncommunication systems empowered by deep learning techniques. It has greatly\nimproved the efficiency of information transmission. Nevertheless, traditional\nsemantic communication models still face challenges, particularly due to their\nsingle-task and single-modal orientation. Many of these models are designed for\nspecific tasks, which may result in limitations when applied to multi-task\ncommunication systems. Moreover, these models often overlook the correlations\namong different modal data in multi-modal tasks. It leads to an incomplete\nunderstanding of complex information, causing increased communication overhead\nand diminished performance. To address these problems, we propose a multi-modal\nfusion-based multi-task semantic communication (MFMSC) framework. In contrast\nto traditional semantic communication approaches, MFMSC can effectively handle\nvarious tasks across multiple modalities. Furthermore, we design a fusion\nmodule based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)\nfor multi-modal semantic information fusion. By leveraging the powerful\nsemantic understanding capabilities and self-attention mechanism of BERT, we\nachieve effective fusion of semantic information from different modalities. We\ncompare our model with multiple benchmarks. Simulation results show that MFMSC\noutperforms these models in terms of both performance and communication\noverhead.",

      "abstract": "In traditional models of supervised learning, the goal of a learner -- given\nexamples from an arbitrary joint distribution on $\\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\{\\pm\n1\\}$ -- is to output a hypothesis that is competitive (to within $\\epsilon$) of\nthe best fitting concept from some class. In order to escape strong hardness\nresults for learning even simple concept classes, we introduce a\nsmoothed-analysis framework that requires a learner to compete only with the\nbest classifier that is robust to small random Gaussian perturbation.\n  This subtle change allows us to give a wide array of learning results for any\nconcept that (1) depends on a low-dimensional subspace (aka multi-index model)\nand (2) has a bounded Gaussian surface area. This class includes functions of\nhalfspaces and (low-dimensional) convex sets, cases that are only known to be\nlearnable in non-smoothed settings with respect to highly structured\ndistributions such as Gaussians.\n  Surprisingly, our analysis also yields new results for traditional\nnon-smoothed frameworks such as learning with margin. In particular, we obtain\nthe first algorithm for agnostically learning intersections of $k$-halfspaces\nin time $k^{poly(\\frac{\\log k}{\\epsilon \\gamma}) }$ where $\\gamma$ is the\nmargin parameter. Before our work, the best-known runtime was exponential in\n$k$ (Arriaga and Vempala, 1999).",

      "abstract": "Overparameterization, the condition where models have more parameters than\nnecessary to fit their training loss, is a crucial factor for the success of\ndeep learning. However, the characteristics of the features learned by\noverparameterized networks are not well understood. In this work, we explore\nthis question by comparing models with the same architecture but different\nwidths. We first examine the expressivity of the features of these models, and\nshow that the feature space of overparameterized networks cannot be spanned by\nconcatenating many underparameterized features, and vice versa. This reveals\nthat both overparameterized and underparameterized networks acquire some\ndistinctive features. We then evaluate the performance of these models, and\nfind that overparameterized networks outperform underparameterized networks,\neven when many of the latter are concatenated. We corroborate these findings\nusing a VGG-16 and ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and a Transformer on the MNLI\nclassification dataset. Finally, we propose a toy setting to explain how\noverparameterized networks can learn some important features that the\nunderparamaterized networks cannot learn.",

      "abstract": "Image dehazing, addressing atmospheric interference like fog and haze,\nremains a pervasive challenge crucial for robust vision applications such as\nsurveillance and remote sensing under adverse visibility. While various\nmethodologies have evolved from early works predicting transmission matrix and\natmospheric light features to deep learning and dehazing networks, they\ninnately prioritize dehazing quality metrics, neglecting the need for real-time\napplicability in time-sensitive domains like autonomous driving. This work\nintroduces FALCON (Frequency Adjoint Link with CONtinuous density mask), a\nsingle-image dehazing system achieving state-of-the-art performance on both\nquality and speed.

Further, we leverage the\nunderlying haze distribution based on the atmospheric scattering model via a\nContinuous Density Mask (CDM) which serves as a continuous-valued mask input\nprior and a differentiable auxiliary loss. Comprehensive experiments involving\nmultiple state-of-the-art methods and ablation analysis demonstrate FALCON's\nexceptional performance in both dehazing quality and speed (i.e., >$180\nframes-per-second), quantified by metrics such as FPS, PSNR, and SSIM.",

      "abstract": "The study of interplay between the geometric nature of Bloch electrons and\ntransverse responses under strong field offers new opportunities for\noptoelectronic applications. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the\nstrong-field response of Weyl Dirac nodes in bilayer T'-WTe2 using\ntime-dependent first-principles formalism. The electron dynamics is explored\nfocusing on the mid-infrared frequency, ranging from the perturbative to\nnonperturbative regime. In the nonperturbative regime, the high-harmonic\ngeneration (HHG) spectra under a strong field clearly exhibit a plateau and\nenergy cutoffs for both longitudinal and anomalous Hall (transverse) currents,\nwith the latter being due to the large interband Berry curvature of the\nWeyl-Dirac semimetal. For the longitudinal harmonics, the intraband\ncontributions increase with intensity, resulting in a complex interplay between\ninterband polarization and intraband motions. Remarkably, if we take a\ncomprehensive all-band perspective enabled by time-dependent density functional\ncalculations, the anomalous Hall responses are purely attributed to the\ninterband processes, even in the nonperturbative regime, thus Hall HHG can be\ncrucial to understand the carrier dynamics. Our findings suggest that HHG\nassociated with the ultrafast strong-field driven electron dynamics holds\nimmense potential for exploring the nonlinear high Hall responses in Weyl\nsemimetal.",

      "abstract": "We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the\n[C II] 158 $\\mu$m line and the underlying continuum emission of TN\nJ0924$-$2201, which is one of the most distant known radio galaxies at $z>5$.\nThe [C II] line and 1-mm continuum emission are detected at the host galaxy.\nThe systemic redshift derived from the [C II] line is $z_{\\rm [C\nII]}=5.1736\\pm0.0002$, indicating that the Ly$\\alpha$ line is redshifted by a\nvelocity of $1035\\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$, marking the largest velocity offset\nbetween the [C II] and Ly$\\alpha$ lines recorded at $z>5$ to date. In the\ncentral region of the host galaxy, we identified a redshifted substructure of\n[C II] with a velocity of $702\\pm17$ km s$^{-1}$, which is close to the CIV\nline with a velocity of $500\\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$. The position and the velocity\noffsets align with a model of an outflowing shell structure, consistent with\nthe large velocity offset of Ly$\\alpha$. The non-detection of [C II] and dust\nemission from the three CO(1--0)-detected companions indicates their different\nnature compared to dwarf galaxies based on the photodissociation region model.\nGiven their large velocity of $\\sim1500$ km s$^{-1}$, outflowing molecular\nclouds induced by the AGN is the most plausible interpretation, and they may\nexceed the escape velocity of a $10^{13}\\,M_{\\odot}$ halo. These results\nsuggest that TN J0924$-$2201, with the ongoing and fossil large-scale outflows,\nis in a distinctive phase of removing molecular gas from a central massive\ngalaxy in an overdense region in the early universe. A dusty HI absorber at the\nhost galaxy is an alternative interpretation.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval\n(ZS-SBIR). The prior methods tackle the problem in a two-modality setting with\nonly category labels or even no textual information involved. However, the\ngrowing prevalence of Large-scale pre-trained Language Models (LLMs), which\nhave demonstrated great knowledge learned from web-scale data, can provide us\nwith an opportunity to conclude collective textual information. Our key\ninnovation lies in the usage of text data as auxiliary information for images,\nthus leveraging the inherent zero-shot generalization ability that language\noffers. To this end, we propose an approach called Cross-Modal Attention\nAlignment Network with Auxiliary Text Description for zero-shot sketch-based\nimage retrieval. The network consists of three components: (i) a Description\nGeneration Module that generates textual descriptions for each training\ncategory by prompting an LLM with several interrogative sentences, (ii) a\nFeature Extraction Module that includes two ViTs for sketch and image data, a\ntransformer for extracting tokens of sentences of each training category,\nfinally (iii) a Cross-modal Alignment Module that exchanges the token features\nof both text-sketch and text-image using cross-attention mechanism, and align\nthe tokens locally and globally. Extensive experiments on three benchmark\ndatasets show our superior performances over the state-of-the-art ZS-SBIR\nmethods.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, self-driving\ncars have become a central focus in the development of future transportation\nsystems. Scenario generation technology has emerged as a crucial tool for\ntesting and verifying the safety performance of autonomous driving systems.\nCurrent research in scenario generation primarily focuses on open roads such as\nhighways, with relatively limited studies on underground parking garages. The\nunique structural constraints, insufficient lighting, and high-density\nobstacles in underground parking garages impose greater demands on the\nperception systems, which are critical to autonomous driving technology.\n  This study proposes an accelerated generation method for perception failure\nscenarios tailored to the underground parking garage environment, aimed at\ntesting and improving the safety performance of autonomous vehicle (AV)\nperception algorithms in such settings. The method presented in this paper\ngenerates an intelligent testing environment with a high density of perception\nfailure scenarios by learning the interactions between background vehicles\n(BVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) within perception failure scenarios.\nFurthermore, this method edits the Markov process within the perception failure\nscenario data to increase the density of critical information in the training\ndata, thereby optimizing the learning and generation of perception failure\nscenarios. A simulation environment for an underground parking garage was\ndeveloped using the Carla and Vissim platforms, with Bevfusion employed as the\nperception algorithm for testing. The study demonstrates that this method can\ngenerate an intelligent testing environment with a high density of perception\nfailure scenarios and enhance the safety performance of perception algorithms\nwithin this experimental setup.",

      "abstract": "As cameras become ubiquitous in our living environment, invasion of privacy\nis becoming a growing concern. A common approach to privacy preservation is to\nremove personally identifiable information from a captured image, but there is\na risk of the original image being leaked. In this paper, we propose a\npre-capture privacy-aware imaging method that captures images from which the\ndetails of a pre-specified anonymized target have been eliminated. The proposed\nmethod applies a single-pixel imaging framework in which we introduce a\nfeedback mechanism called an aperture pattern generator. The introduced\naperture pattern generator adaptively outputs the next aperture pattern to\navoid sampling the anonymized target by exploiting the data already acquired as\na clue. Furthermore, the anonymized target can be set to any object without\nchanging hardware. Except for detailed features which have been removed from\nthe anonymized target, the captured images are of comparable quality to those\ncaptured by a general camera and can be used for various computer vision\napplications. In our work, we target faces and license plates and\nexperimentally show that the proposed method can capture clear images in which\ndetailed features of the anonymized target are eliminated to achieve both\nprivacy and utility.",

      "abstract": "With the remarkable advancements of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based\nagents have become a research hotspot in human-computer interaction. However,\nthere is a scarcity of benchmarks available for LLM-based mobile agents.\nBenchmarking these agents generally faces three main challenges: (1) The\ninefficiency of UI-only operations imposes limitations to task evaluation. (2)\nSpecific instructions within a singular application lack adequacy for assessing\nthe multi-dimensional reasoning and decision-making capacities of LLM mobile\nagents. (3) Current evaluation metrics are insufficient to accurately assess\nthe process of sequential actions. To this end, we propose Mobile-Bench, a\nnovel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLM-based mobile agents.\nFirst, we expand conventional UI operations by incorporating 103 collected APIs\nto accelerate the efficiency of task completion. Subsequently, we collect\nevaluation data by combining real user queries with augmentation from LLMs. To\nbetter evaluate different levels of planning capabilities for mobile agents,\nour data is categorized into three distinct groups: SAST, SAMT, and MAMT,\nreflecting varying levels of task complexity. Mobile-Bench comprises 832 data\nentries, with more than 200 tasks specifically designed to evaluate multi-APP\ncollaboration scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a more accurate evaluation\nmetric, named CheckPoint, to assess whether LLM-based mobile agents reach\nessential points during their planning and reasoning steps.",

      "abstract": "In the digital era, data has become a pivotal asset, advancing technologies\nsuch as autonomous driving. Despite this, data trading faces challenges like\nthe absence of robust pricing methods and the lack of trustworthy trading\nmechanisms. To address these challenges, we introduce a traffic-oriented data\ntrading platform named Data on The Move (DTM), integrating traffic simulation,\ndata trading, and Artificial Intelligent (AI) agents. The DTM platform supports\nevident-based data value evaluation and AI-based trading mechanisms. Leveraging\nthe common sense capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess traffic\nstate and data value, DTM can determine reasonable traffic data pricing through\nmulti-round interaction and simulations. Moreover, DTM provides a pricing\nmethod validation by simulating traffic systems, multi-agent interactions, and\nthe heterogeneity and irrational behaviors of individuals in the trading\nmarket. Within the DTM platform, entities such as connected vehicles and\ntraffic light controllers could engage in information collecting, data pricing,\ntrading, and decision-making. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed\nAI agent-based pricing approach enhances data trading by offering rational\nprices, as evidenced by the observed improvement in traffic efficiency. This\nunderscores the effectiveness and practical value of DTM, offering new\nperspectives for the evolution of data markets and smart cities. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first study employing LLMs in data pricing and a\npioneering data trading practice in the field of intelligent vehicles and smart\ncities.",

Although HTE estimation methods aim to improve accuracy, how to\nprovide explicit subgroup descriptions remains unclear, hindering data\ninterpretation and strategic intervention management. In this paper, we propose\nCURLS, a novel rule learning method leveraging HTE, which can effectively\ndescribe subgroups with significant treatment effects.

We\ndesign an iterative procedure based on the minorize-maximization algorithm and\nsolve a submodular lower bound as an approximation for the original.\nQuantitative experiments and qualitative case studies verify that compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods, CURLS can find subgroups where the estimated and true\neffects are 16.1% and 13.8% higher and the variance is 12.0% smaller, while\nmaintaining similar or better estimation accuracy and rule interpretability.\nCode is available at https://osf.io/zwp2k/.",

      "abstract": "The rapid decline in groundwater around the world poses a significant\nchallenge to sustainable agriculture. To address this issue, agricultural\nmanaged aquifer recharge (Ag-MAR) is proposed to recharge the aquifer by\nartificially flooding agricultural lands using surface water. Ag-MAR requires a\ncarefully selected flooding schedule to avoid affecting the oxygen absorption\nof crop roots. However, current Ag-MAR scheduling does not take into account\ncomplex environmental factors such as weather and soil oxygen, resulting in\ncrop damage and insufficient recharging amounts. This paper proposes MARLP, the\nfirst end-to-end data-driven control system for Ag-MAR. We first formulate\nAg-MAR as an optimization problem. To that end, we analyze four-year in-field\ndatasets, which reveal the multi-periodicity feature of the soil oxygen level\ntrends and the opportunity to use external weather forecasts and flooding\nproposals as exogenous clues for soil oxygen prediction. Then, we design a\ntwo-stage forecasting framework. In the first stage, it extracts both the\ncross-variate dependency and the periodic patterns from historical data to\nconduct preliminary forecasting. In the second stage, it uses weather-soil and\nflooding-soil causality to facilitate an accurate prediction of soil oxygen\nlevels. Finally, we conduct model predictive control (MPC) for Ag-MAR flooding.\nTo address the challenge of large action spaces, we devise a heuristic planning\nmodule to reduce the number of flooding proposals to enable the search for\noptimal solutions. Real-world experiments show that MARLP reduces the oxygen\ndeficit ratio by 86.8% while improving the recharging amount in unit time by\n35.8%, compared with the previous four years.",

      "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems may face a heavy\ncomputation burden since the sensory data needs to be further processed. This\npaper studies a novel system that integrates sensing, communication, and\ncomputation, aiming to provide services for different objectives efficiently.\nThis system consists of a multi-antenna multi-functional base station (BS), an\nedge server, a target, and multiple singleantenna communication users. The BS\nneeds to allocate the available resources to efficiently provide sensing,\ncommunication, and computation services. Due to the heavy service burden and\nlimited power budget, the BS can partially offload the tasks to the nearby edge\nserver instead of computing them locally. We consider the estimation of the\ntarget response matrix, a general problem in radar sensing, and utilize\nCramer-Rao bound (CRB) as the corresponding performance metric. To tackle the\nnon-convex optimization problem, we propose both semidefinite relaxation\n(SDR)-based alternating optimization and SDR-based successive convex\napproximation (SCA) algorithms to minimize the CRB of radar sensing while\nmeeting the requirement of communication users and the need for task computing.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the optimal rankone solutions of both the\nalternating and SCA algorithms can be directly obtained via the solver or\nfurther constructed even when dealing with multiple functionalities. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed algorithms can provide higher target estimation\nperformance than state-of-the-art benchmarks while satisfying the communication\nand computation constraints.",

      "abstract": "In the task of multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) tracking of pedestrians, the\ndata association problem is a key issue and main challenge, especially with\ncomplications arising from camera movements, lighting variations, and\nobstructions. However, most MTMC models adopt two-step approaches, thus heavily\ndepending on the results of the first-step tracking in practical applications.\nMoreover, the same targets crossing different cameras may exhibit significant\nappearance variations, which further increases the difficulty of cross-camera\nmatching. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a global online MTMC\ntracking model that addresses the dependency on the first tracking stage in\ntwo-step methods and enhances cross-camera matching. Specifically, we propose a\ntransformer-based global MTMC association module to explore target associations\nacross different cameras and frames, generating global trajectories directly.\nAdditionally, to integrate the appearance and spatio-temporal features of\ntargets, we propose a feature extraction and fusion module for MTMC tracking.\nThis module enhances feature representation and establishes correlations\nbetween the features of targets across multiple cameras. To accommodate high\nscene diversity and complex lighting condition variations, we have established\nthe VisionTrack dataset, which enables the development of models that are more\ngeneralized and robust to various environments. Our model demonstrates\nsignificant improvements over comparison methods on the VisionTrack dataset and\nothers.",

We present characterization of the BTO thin film using x-ray\ndiffraction and piezo-response force microscopy to clearly demonstrate single\ncrystal, single domain growth of the film which enables the desired periodic\npoling. To investigate the poling quality, we apply both non-destructive piezo\nforce response microscopy and destructive etching-assisted scanning electron\nmicroscopy and we show that high quality, uniform and intransient poling with\n50 % duty cycle and periods ranging from 2 {\\mu}m to 10 {\\mu}m is achieved. The\nsuccessful realization of periodic poling in BTO thin film unlocks the\npotential for highly efficient nonlinear processes under quasi-phase-matching\nthat seemed far-fetched with prior polycrystalline BTO thin films which\npredominantly relied on efficiency-limited random or non-phase matching\nconditions and is a key step towards integration of BTO photonic devices.",

This paper addresses the challenge of enabling LLMs to autonomously\nselect between fast and slow inference methods, thereby optimizing both\nefficiency and effectiveness.

      "abstract": "This paper considers the collaborative graph exploration problem in\nGPS-denied environments, where a group of robots are required to cover a graph\nenvironment while maintaining reliable pose estimations in collaborative\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Considering both objectives\npresents challenges for multi-robot pathfinding, as it involves the expensive\ncovariance inference for SLAM uncertainty evaluation, especially considering\nvarious combinations of robots' paths. To reduce the computational complexity,\nwe propose an efficient two-stage strategy where exploration paths are first\ngenerated for quick coverage, and then enhanced by adding informative and\ndistance-efficient loop-closing actions, called loop edges, along the paths for\nreliable pose estimation. We formulate the latter problem as a non-monotone\nsubmodular maximization problem by relating SLAM uncertainty with pose graph\ntopology, which (1) facilitates more efficient evaluation of SLAM uncertainty\nthan covariance inference, and (2) allows the application of approximation\nalgorithms in submodular optimization to provide optimality guarantees. We\nfurther introduce the ordering heuristics to improve objective values while\npreserving the optimality bound. Simulation experiments over randomly generated\ngraph environments verify the efficiency of our methods in finding paths for\nquick coverage and enhanced pose graph reliability, and benchmark the\nperformance of the approximation algorithms and the greedy-based algorithm in\nthe loop edge selection problem.

      "abstract": "Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD), leveraging unlabeled data to boost\nobject detectors, has become a hot topic recently. However, existing SSOD\napproaches mainly focus on horizontal objects, leaving multi-oriented objects\ncommon in aerial images unexplored. At the same time, the annotation cost of\nmulti-oriented objects is significantly higher than that of their horizontal\ncounterparts. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective\nSemi-supervised Oriented Object Detection method termed SOOD++. Specifically,\nwe observe that objects from aerial images are usually arbitrary orientations,\nsmall scales, and aggregation, which inspires the following core designs: a\nSimple Instance-aware Dense Sampling (SIDS) strategy is used to generate\ncomprehensive dense pseudo-labels; the Geometry-aware Adaptive Weighting (GAW)\nloss dynamically modulates the importance of each pair between pseudo-label and\ncorresponding prediction by leveraging the intricate geometric information of\naerial objects; we treat aerial images as global layouts and explicitly build\nthe many-to-many relationship between the sets of pseudo-labels and predictions\nvia the proposed Noise-driven Global Consistency (NGC). Extensive experiments\nconducted on various multi-oriented object datasets under various labeled\nsettings demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For example, on the\nDOTA-V1.5 benchmark, the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) by a large margin (+2.92, +2.39, and +2.57 mAP under 10%, 20%, and 30%\nlabeled data settings, respectively) with single-scale training and testing.\nMore importantly, it still improves upon a strong supervised baseline with\n70.66 mAP, trained using the full DOTA-V1.5 train-val set, by +1.82 mAP,\nresulting in a 72.48 mAP, pushing the new state-of-the-art.

The recent trends demonstrate the potential homogeneity\nof these two fields, especially when deep-learning models aid these two\ncategories for better probability modeling. For better understanding and\ndescribing from a unified perspective, inspired by the basic generally\nrecognized principles in cognitive psychology, we formulate a novel problem of\nCoding for Intelligence from the category theory view. Based on the three\naxioms: existence of ideal coding, existence of practical coding, and\ncompactness promoting generalization, we derive a general framework to\nunderstand existing methodologies, namely that, coding captures the intrinsic\nrelationships of objects as much as possible, while ignoring information\nirrelevant to downstream tasks. This framework helps identify the challenges\nand essential elements in solving the specific derived Minimal Description\nLength (MDL) optimization problem from a broader range, providing opportunities\nto build a more intelligent system for handling multiple tasks/applications\nwith coding ideas/tools. Centering on those elements, we systematically review\nrecent processes of towards optimizing the MDL problem in more comprehensive\nways from data, model, and task perspectives, and reveal their impacts on the\npotential CfI technical routes. After that, we also present new technique paths\nto fulfill CfI and provide potential solutions with preliminary experimental\nevidence.

      "abstract": "Recently, many machine learning optimizers have been analysed considering\nthem as the asymptotic limit of some differential equations when the step size\ngoes to zero. In other words, the optimizers can be seen as a finite difference\nscheme applied to a continuous dynamical system. But the major part of the\nresults in the literature concerns constant step size algorithms. The main aim\nof this paper is to investigate the guarantees of the adaptive step size\ncounterpart. In fact, this dynamical point of view can be used to design step\nsize update rules, by choosing a discretization of the continuous equation that\npreserves its most relevant features. In this work, we analyse this kind of\nadaptive optimizers and prove their Lyapunov stability and convergence\nproperties for any choice of hyperparameters. At the best of our knowledge,\nthis paper introduces for the first time the use of continuous selection theory\nfrom general topology to overcome some of the intrinsic difficulties due to the\nnon constant and non regular step size policies. The general framework\ndeveloped gives many new results on adaptive and constant step size\nMomentum/Heavy-Ball and p-GD algorithms.",

The ultra-wide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver\n(UWL) of the Parkes 'Murriyang' radio telescope is utilised for full\npolarisation observations covering frequencies from 704-4032 MHz.\nDepolarisation of pulsed emission is observed during the eclipse phase of three\nBW MSPs namely, J0024-7204J, J1431-4715 and PSR J1959+2048, consistent with\nprevious studies of other BW MSPs.

For PSR J0024-7204J,\nwe report temporal variation of the eclipse cutoff frequency coupled with\nchanges in the electron column density within the eclipse medium across six\nobserved eclipses. Moreover, the eclipse cutoff frequency for PSR J1431-4715 is\ndetermined to be 1251 $\\pm$ 80 MHz, leading to the conclusion that synchrotron\nabsorption is the primary mechanism responsible for the eclipsing.\nAdditionally, for PSR J1959+2048, the estimated cutoff frequency exceeded 1400\nMHz, consistent with previous studies. With this investigation, we have doubled\nthe sample size of BW MSPs with orbital phase-resolved studies allowing a\nbetter probe to the eclipse environment.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for solving inverse problems\ndue to their exceptional ability to model complex prior distributions. However,\nexisting methods predominantly assume known forward operators (i.e.,\nnon-blind), limiting their applicability in practical settings where acquiring\nsuch operators is costly. Additionally, many current approaches rely on\npixel-space diffusion models, leaving the potential of more powerful latent\ndiffusion models (LDMs) underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LatentDEM,\nan innovative technique that addresses more challenging blind inverse problems\nusing latent diffusion priors. At the core of our method is solving blind\ninverse problems within an iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework:\n(1) the E-step recovers clean images from corrupted observations using LDM\npriors and a known forward model, and (2) the M-step estimates the forward\noperator based on the recovered images. Additionally, we propose two novel\noptimization techniques tailored for LDM priors and EM frameworks, yielding\nmore accurate and efficient blind inversion results. As a general framework,\nLatentDEM supports both linear and non-linear inverse problems. Beyond common\n2D image restoration tasks, it enables new capabilities in non-linear 3D\ninverse rendering problems. We validate LatentDEM's performance on\nrepresentative 2D blind deblurring and 3D sparse-view reconstruction tasks,\ndemonstrating its superior efficacy over prior arts.",

In this paper, we introduce a method for speech-driven 3D\nfacial animation to generate accurate lip movements, proposing an audio-visual\nmultimodal perceptual loss. This loss provides guidance to train the\nspeech-driven 3D facial animators to generate plausible lip motions aligned\nwith the spoken transcripts.

      "abstract": "We present a quantitative spectral analysis of the extreme nitrogen-enhanced\nsupergiant HD 93840 (BN1 Ib) at an intermediate galactic latitude. Based on an\noptical high-resolution spectrum and complementary ultraviolet and infrared\n(spectro-)photometry, in addition to Gaia data, we carried out a full\ncharacterisation of the star's properties. We used both hydrostatic and unified\n(photosphere+wind) model atmospheres that account for deviations from local\nthermodynamic equilibrium. A highly unusual surface CNO-mixing signature and a\nmarked stellar overluminosity compared to the mass imply a binary channel for\nthe star's past evolution. The kinematics shows that it has reached its current\nposition above the Galactic plane as a runaway star, likely ejected by the\nsupernova explosion of its former companion star. Its current bulk composition,\nwith a notably increased mean molecular weight due to core He- and progressed\nshell H-burning, suggests an advanced evolutionary stage. It is poised to yield\na rare core-collapse supernova of a blue supergiant about ten OB star\npopulation scale heights above the Galactic disk relatively soon, contributing\nto the metal enrichment of the circumgalactic medium.",

      "abstract": "Context: Observations of transient emission from extreme accretion events\nonto supermassive black holes can reveal conditions in the center of galaxies\nand the black hole itself. Most recently, they have been suggested to be\nemitters of high-energy neutrinos. If it is suddenly rejuvenated accretion or a\ntidal disruption event (TDE) is not clear in most cases. Aims: We expanded on\nexisting samples of infrared flares to compile the largest and most complete\nlist available. A large sample size is necessary to provide high enough\nstatistics for far away and faint objects to estimate their rate. Our catalog\nis large enough to facilitate a preliminary study of the rate evolution with\nredshift for the first time. Methods: We compiled a sample of 40 million\ngalaxies, and, using a custom, publicly available pipeline, analyzed the WISE\nlight curves for these 40 million objects using the Bayesian Blocks algorithm.\nWe selected promising candidates for dust echos of transient accretion events\nand inferred the luminosity, extension, and temperature of the hot dust by\nfitting a blackbody spectrum. Results: We established a clean sample of 823\ndust-echo-like infrared flares, of which we can estimate the dust properties\nfor 568. After removing 70 objects with possible contribution by synchrotron\nemission, the luminosity, extension, and temperature are consistent with dust\nechos. Estimating the dust extension from the light curve shape revealed that\nthe duration of the incident flare is broadly compatible with the duration of\nTDEs. The resulting rate per galaxy is consistent with the latest measurements\nof infrared-detected TDEs and appears to decline at increasing redshift.\nConclusions: Although systematic uncertainties may impact the calculation of\nthe rate evolution, this catalog will enable further research in phenomena\nrelated to dust-echos from TDEs and extreme accretion flares.",

The increasing cognitive alignment of these\nmodels has made them candidates for cognitive science theories. Prior research\ninto the emergent cognitive abilities of PLMs has largely been path-independent\nto model training, i.e., has focused on the final model weights and not the\nintermediate steps. However, building plausible models of human cognition using\nPLMs would benefit from considering the developmental alignment of their\nperformance during training to the trajectories of children's thinking. Guided\nby psychometric tests of human intelligence, we choose four sets of tasks to\ninvestigate the alignment of ten popular families of PLMs and evaluate their\navailable intermediate and final training steps. These tasks are Numerical\nability, Linguistic abilities, Conceptual understanding, and Fluid reasoning.\nWe find a striking regularity: regardless of model size, the developmental\ntrajectories of PLMs consistently exhibit a window of maximal alignment to\nhuman cognitive development. Before that window, training appears to endow\n\"blank slate\" models with the requisite structure to be poised to rapidly learn\nfrom experience. After that window, training appears to serve the engineering\ngoal of reducing loss but not the scientific goal of increasing alignment with\nhuman cognition.",

      "abstract": "While the animals' Fin-to-Limb evolution has been well-researched in biology,\nsuch morphological transformation remains under-adopted in the modern design of\nadvanced robotic limbs. This paper investigates a novel class of\noverconstrained locomotion from a design and learning perspective inspired by\nevolutionary morphology, aiming to integrate the concept of `intelligent design\nunder constraints' - hereafter referred to as constraint-driven design\nintelligence - in developing modern robotic limbs with superior energy\nefficiency. We propose a 3D-printable design of robotic limbs parametrically\nreconfigurable as a classical planar 4-bar linkage, an overconstrained Bennett\nlinkage, and a spherical 4-bar linkage. These limbs adopt a co-axial actuation,\nidentical to the modern legged robot platforms, with the added capability of\nupgrading into a wheel-legged system. Then, we implemented a large-scale,\nmulti-terrain deep reinforcement learning framework to train these\nreconfigurable limbs for a comparative analysis of overconstrained locomotion\nin energy efficiency. Results show that the overconstrained limbs exhibit more\nefficient locomotion than planar limbs during forward and sideways walking over\ndifferent terrains, including floors, slopes, and stairs, with or without\nrandom noises, by saving at least 22% mechanical energy in completing the\ntraverse task, with the spherical limbs being the least efficient. It also\nachieves the highest average speed of 0.85 meters per second on flat terrain,\nwhich is 20% faster than the planar limbs. This study paves the path for an\nexciting direction for future research in overconstrained robotics leveraging\nevolutionary morphology and reconfigurable mechanism intelligence when combined\nwith state-of-the-art methods in deep reinforcement learning.",

We propose\nsome modification of the methods for convex optimization with inexact gradient\nbased on the subspace optimization such as Nemirovski's Conjugate Gradients and\nSequential Subspace Optimization. We research the method convergence for\ndifferent condition of inexactness both in gradient value and accuracy of\nsubspace optimization problems. Besides this, we investigate generalization of\nthis result to the class of quasar-convex (weakly-quasi-convex) functions.",

      "abstract": "Fuzzy transition systems offer a robust framework for modeling and analyzing\nsystems with inherent uncertainties and imprecision, which are prevalent in\nreal-world scenarios. As their extension, nondeterministic fuzzy transition\nsystems (NFTSs) have been studied in a considerable number of works. Wu et al.\n(2018) provided an algorithm for computing the greatest crisp bisimulation of a\nfinite NFTS $\\mathcal{S} = \\langle S, A, \\delta \\rangle$, with a time\ncomplexity of order $O(|S|^4 \\cdot |\\delta|^2)$ under the assumption that\n$|\\delta| \\geq |S|$. Qiao {\\em et al.} (2023) provided an algorithm for\ncomputing the greatest fuzzy bisimulation of a finite NFTS $\\mathcal{S}$ under\nthe G\\\"odel semantics, with a time complexity of order $O(|S|^4 \\cdot\n|\\delta|^2 \\cdot l)$ under the assumption that $|\\delta| \\geq |S|$, where $l$\nis the number of fuzzy values used in $\\mathcal{S}$ plus 1. In this work, we\nprovide efficient algorithms for computing the partition corresponding to the\ngreatest crisp bisimulation of a finite NFTS $\\mathcal{S}$, as well as the\ncompact fuzzy partition corresponding to the greatest fuzzy bisimulation of\n$\\mathcal{S}$ under the G\\\"odel semantics. Their time complexities are of the\norder $O((size(\\delta) \\log{l} + |S|) \\log{(|S| + |\\delta|)})$, where $l$ is\nthe number of fuzzy values used in $\\mathcal{S}$ plus 2. When $|\\delta| \\geq\n|S|$, this order is within $O(|S| \\cdot |\\delta| \\cdot \\log^2{|\\delta|})$. The\nreduction of time complexity from $O(|S|^4 \\cdot |\\delta|^2)$ and $O(|S|^4\n\\cdot |\\delta|^2 \\cdot l)$ to $O(|S| \\cdot |\\delta| \\cdot \\log^2{|\\delta|})$ is\na significant contribution of this work.

We develop a general and computationally tractable approach for\nexact analysis in two-arm RA designs with binary outcomes.

Our efficient\nforward recursion implementation allows for testing of two-arm trials with\n1,000 participants on a standard computer. Through an illustrative\ncomputational study of trials using randomized dynamic programming we show\nthat, contrary to what is known for equal allocation, a conditional exact test\nhas, almost uniformly, higher power than the unconditional test.

To close this gap between theory and computation, we introduce\nlocal linear approximation (LLA) algorithms to compute the full and reduced\nmodel estimators for these tests and develop theory specifically for the LLA\nsolutions. We prove that our LLA algorithms converge to oracle estimators for\nthe full and reduced models in two steps with overwhelming probability. We then\nleverage this strong oracle result and the asymptotic properties of the oracle\nestimators to show that the partial penalized test statistics evaluated at the\ntwo-step LLA solutions are approximately chi-square in large samples, giving us\nguarantees for the tests using specific computed solutions and thereby closing\nthe theoretical gap. We conduct simulation studies to assess the finite-sample\nperformance of our testing procedures, finding that partial penalized tests\nusing the LLA solutions agree with tests using the oracle estimators, and\ndemonstrate our testing procedures in a real data application.",

      "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) capabilities are foundational to the success of\nlarge language models (LLMs). Recently, context compression has attracted\ngrowing interest since it can largely reduce reasoning complexities and\ncomputation costs of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel Query-gUIded\naTtention cOmpression (QUITO) method, which leverages attention of the question\nover the contexts to filter useless information. Specifically, we take a\ntrigger token to calculate the attention distribution of the context in\nresponse to the question. Based on the distribution, we propose three different\nfiltering methods to satisfy the budget constraints of the context length. We\nevaluate the QUITO using two widely-used datasets, namely, NaturalQuestions and\nASQA. Experimental results demonstrate that QUITO significantly outperforms\nestablished baselines across various datasets and downstream LLMs, underscoring\nits effectiveness.

The\nkey insight of our methods is to establish implicit-semantic area matching\nprior to point matching, based on advanced image understanding of SAM. Then,\ninformative area matches with consistent internal semantic are able to undergo\ndense feature comparison, facilitating precise inside-area point matching.\nSpecifically, MESA adopts a sparse matching framework and first obtains\ncandidate areas from SAM results through a novel Area Graph (AG). Then, area\nmatching among the candidates is formulated as graph energy minimization and\nsolved by graphical models derived from AG. To address the efficiency issue of\nMESA, we further propose DMESA as its dense counterpart, applying a dense\nmatching framework. After candidate areas are identified by AG, DMESA\nestablishes area matches through generating dense matching distributions. The\ndistributions are produced from off-the-shelf patch matching utilizing the\nGaussian Mixture Model and refined via the Expectation Maximization. With less\nrepetitive computation, DMESA showcases a speed improvement of nearly five\ntimes compared to MESA, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our methods are\nextensively evaluated on five datasets encompassing indoor and outdoor scenes.\nThe results illustrate consistent performance improvements from our methods for\nfive distinct point matching baselines across all datasets. Furthermore, our\nmethods exhibit promise generalization and improved robustness against image\nresolution variations. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/Easonyesheng/A2PM-MESA.",

We measure the temporal features from capturing the dynamic band\nstructures of the lattice and demonstrate a variety of time-dependent synthetic\nlattice models by engineering the driven pattern of the modulation,\nhighlighting great flexibility of the microresonator. Our work shows a photonic\nchip for simulating versatile time-dependent Hamiltonians, which pushes forward\nquantum simulations in integrated photonics with great experimental tunability\nand reconfigurability.",

      "title": "Gradient Harmonization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation",
      "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) intends to transfer knowledge from a\nlabeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Many current methods focus\non learning feature representations that are both discriminative for\nclassification and invariant across domains by simultaneously optimizing domain\nalignment and classification tasks. However, these methods often overlook a\ncrucial challenge: the inherent conflict between these two tasks during\ngradient-based optimization. In this paper, we delve into this issue and\nintroduce two effective solutions known as Gradient Harmonization, including GH\nand GH++, to mitigate the conflict between domain alignment and classification\ntasks. GH operates by altering the gradient angle between different tasks from\nan obtuse angle to an acute angle, thus resolving the conflict and trade-offing\nthe two tasks in a coordinated manner. Yet, this would cause both tasks to\ndeviate from their original optimization directions. We thus further propose an\nimproved version, GH++, which adjusts the gradient angle between tasks from an\nobtuse angle to a vertical angle. This not only eliminates the conflict but\nalso minimizes deviation from the original gradient directions. Finally, for\noptimization convenience and efficiency, we evolve the gradient harmonization\nstrategies into a dynamically weighted loss function using an integral operator\non the harmonized gradient. Notably, GH/GH++ are orthogonal to UDA and can be\nseamlessly integrated into most existing UDA models. Theoretical insights and\nexperimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed approaches not only enhance\npopular UDA baselines but also improve recent state-of-the-art models.",

      "abstract": "With the advent of the era of foundation models, pre-training and fine-tuning\nhave become common paradigms. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning has\ngarnered widespread attention due to its better balance between the number of\nlearnable parameters and performance. However, some current parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning methods only model a single modality and lack the utilization of\nstructural knowledge in downstream tasks. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes a multi-modal parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on graph\nnetworks. Each image is fed into a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to\ngenerate a text description. The image and its corresponding text description\nare then processed by a frozen image encoder and text encoder to generate image\nfeatures and text features, respectively. A graph is constructed based on the\nsimilarity of the multi-modal feature nodes, and knowledge and relationships\nrelevant to these features are extracted from each node. Additionally, Elastic\nWeight Consolidation (EWC) regularization is incorporated into the loss\nfunction to mitigate the problem of forgetting during task learning. The\nproposed model achieves test accuracies on the OxfordPets, Flowers102, and\nFood101 datasets that improve by 4.45%, 2.92%, and 0.23%, respectively.

GF\ndecoding, a continuous-time methodology based on gradient flow, employs a\npotential energy function associated with bipolar codewords of LDPC codes. The\ndecoding process of the GF decoding is concisely defined by an ordinary\ndifferential equation and thus it is well suited to an analog circuit\nimplementation. We experimentally demonstrate that the decoding performance of\nthe GF decoding for AWGN channels is comparable to that of the multi-bit mode\ngradient descent bit flipping algorithm. We further introduce the negative\nlog-likelihood function of the channel for generalizing the GF decoding. The\nproposed method is shown to be tensor-computable, which means that the gradient\nof the objective function can be evaluated with the combination of basic tensor\ncomputations. This characteristic is well-suited to emerging AI accelerators,\npotentially applicable in wireless signal processing. The paper assesses the\ndecoding performance of the generalized GF decoding in LDPC-coded MIMO\nchannels.

      "abstract": "With the widespread sharing of personal face images in applications' public\ndatabases, face recognition systems faces real threat of being breached by\npotential adversaries who are able to access users' face images and use them to\nintrude the face recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy\nprotection method in the multiscale sparsified feature subspaces to protect\nsensitive facial features, by taking care of the influence or weight ranked\nfeature coefficients on the privacy budget, named \"Ranked Differential Privacy\n(RDP)\". After the multiscale feature decomposition, the lightweight Laplacian\nnoise is added to the dimension-reduced sparsified feature coefficients\naccording to the geometric superposition method. Then, we rigorously prove that\nthe RDP satisfies Differential Privacy. After that, the nonlinear Lagrange\nMultiplier (LM) method is formulated for the constraint optimization problem of\nmaximizing the utility of the visualization quality protected face images with\nsanitizing noise, under a given facial features privacy budget. Then, two\nmethods are proposed to solve the nonlinear LM problem and obtain the optimal\nnoise scale parameters: 1) the analytical Normalization Approximation (NA)\nmethod with identical average noise scale parameter for real-time online\napplications; and 2) the LM optimization Gradient Descent (LMGD) numerical\nmethod to obtain the nonlinear solution through iterative updating for more\naccurate offline applications. Experimental results on two real-world datasets\nshow that our proposed RDP outperforms other state-of-the-art methods: at a\nprivacy budget of 0.2, the PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of the RDP is\nabout ~10 dB higher than (10 times as high as) the highest PSNR of all compared\nmethods.",

      "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received extensive research attention due\nto their powerful information aggregation capabilities. Despite the success of\nGNNs, most of them suffer from the popularity bias issue in a graph caused by a\nsmall number of popular categories. Additionally, real graph datasets always\ncontain incorrect node labels, which hinders GNNs from learning effective node\nrepresentations. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been shown to be\neffective in solving the above problems for node classification tasks. Most\nexisting GCL methods are implemented by randomly removing edges and nodes to\ncreate multiple contrasting views, and then maximizing the mutual information\n(MI) between these contrasting views to improve the node feature\nrepresentation. However, maximizing the mutual information between multiple\ncontrasting views may lead the model to learn some redundant information\nirrelevant to the node classification task. To tackle this issue, we propose an\neffective Contrastive Graph Representation Learning with Adversarial Cross-view\nReconstruction and Information Bottleneck (CGRL) for node classification, which\ncan adaptively learn to mask the nodes and edges in the graph to obtain the\noptimal graph structure representation. Furthermore, we innovatively introduce\nthe information bottleneck theory into GCLs to remove redundant information in\nmultiple contrasting views while retaining as much information as possible\nabout node classification. Moreover, we add noise perturbations to the original\nviews and reconstruct the augmented views by constructing adversarial views to\nimprove the robustness of node feature representation.

      "abstract": "Enabling engagement of manga by visually impaired individuals presents a\nsignificant challenge due to its inherently visual nature. With the goal of\nfostering accessibility, this paper aims to generate a dialogue transcript of a\ncomplete manga chapter, entirely automatically, with a particular emphasis on\nensuring narrative consistency. This entails identifying (i) what is being\nsaid, i.e., detecting the texts on each page and classifying them into\nessential vs non-essential, and (ii) who is saying it, i.e., attributing each\ndialogue to its speaker, while ensuring the same characters are named\nconsistently throughout the chapter.\n  To this end, we introduce: (i) Magiv2, a model that is capable of generating\nhigh-quality chapter-wide manga transcripts with named characters and\nsignificantly higher precision in speaker diarisation over prior works; (ii) an\nextension of the PopManga evaluation dataset, which now includes annotations\nfor speech-bubble tail boxes, associations of text to corresponding tails,\nclassifications of text as essential or non-essential, and the identity for\neach character box; and (iii) a new character bank dataset, which comprises\nover 11K characters from 76 manga series, featuring 11.5K exemplar character\nimages in total, as well as a list of chapters in which they appear.

      "abstract": "Throughout rapid development of multimodal large language models, a crucial\ningredient is a fair and accurate evaluation of their multimodal comprehension\nabilities. Although Visual Question Answering (VQA) could serve as a developed\ntest field, limitations of VQA evaluation, like the inflexible pattern of Exact\nMatch, have hindered MLLMs from demonstrating their real capability and\ndiscourage rich responses. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of\nsemantics-based evaluators for assessing unconstrained open-ended responses on\nVQA datasets. As characteristics of VQA have made such evaluation significantly\ndifferent than the traditional Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task, to\nsystematically analyze the behaviour and compare the performance of various\nevaluators including LLM-based ones, we proposes three key properties, i.e.,\nAlignment, Consistency and Generalization, and a corresponding dataset\nAssessing VQA Evaluators (AVE) to facilitate analysis. In addition, this paper\nproposes a Semantically Flexible VQA Evaluator (SFVE) with meticulous design\nbased on the unique features of VQA evaluation. Experimental results verify the\nfeasibility of model-based VQA evaluation and effectiveness of the proposed\nevaluator that surpasses existing semantic evaluators by a large margin. The\nproposed training scheme generalizes to both the BERT-like encoders and\ndecoder-only LLM.",

      "abstract": "Neural implicit representation, the parameterization of distance function as\na coordinate neural field, has emerged as a promising lead in tackling surface\nreconstruction from unoriented point clouds. To enforce consistent orientation,\nexisting methods focus on regularizing the gradient of the distance function,\nsuch as constraining it to be of the unit norm, minimizing its divergence, or\naligning it with the eigenvector of Hessian that corresponds to zero\neigenvalue. However, under the presence of large scanning noise, they tend to\neither overfit the noise input or produce an excessively smooth reconstruction.\nIn this work, we propose to guide the surface reconstruction under a new\nvariant of neural field, the octahedral field, leveraging the spherical\nharmonics representation of octahedral frames originated in the hexahedral\nmeshing. Such field automatically snaps to geometry features when constrained\nto be smooth, and naturally preserves sharp angles when interpolated over\ncreases. By simultaneously fitting and smoothing the octahedral field alongside\nthe implicit geometry, it behaves analogously to bilateral filtering, resulting\nin smooth reconstruction while preserving sharp edges. Despite being operated\npurely pointwise, our method outperforms various traditional and neural\napproaches across extensive experiments, and is very competitive with methods\nthat require normal and data priors.

      "abstract": "Cross-modal coherence modeling is essential for intelligent systems to help\nthem organize and structure information, thereby understanding and creating\ncontent of the physical world coherently like human-beings. Previous work on\ncross-modal coherence modeling attempted to leverage the order information from\nanother modality to assist the coherence recovering of the target modality.\nDespite of the effectiveness, labeled associated coherency information is not\nalways available and might be costly to acquire, making the cross-modal\nguidance hard to leverage. To tackle this challenge, this paper explores a new\nway to take advantage of cross-modal guidance without gold labels on coherency,\nand proposes the Weak Cross-Modal Guided Ordering (WeGO) model. More\nspecifically, it leverages high-confidence predicted pairwise order in one\nmodality as reference information to guide the coherence modeling in another.\nAn iterative learning paradigm is further designed to jointly optimize the\ncoherence modeling in two modalities with selected guidance from each other.\nThe iterative cross-modal boosting also functions in inference to further\nenhance coherence prediction in each modality. Experimental results on two\npublic datasets have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms existing\nmethods for cross-modal coherence modeling tasks. Major technical modules have\nbeen evaluated effective through ablation studies. Codes are available at:\n\\url{https://github.com/scvready123/IterWeGO}.",

      "title": "Adversarial Text Rewriting for Text-aware Recommender Systems",
      "abstract": "Text-aware recommender systems incorporate rich textual features, such as\ntitles and descriptions, to generate item recommendations for users. The use of\ntextual features helps mitigate cold-start problems, and thus, such recommender\nsystems have attracted increased attention. However, we argue that the\ndependency on item descriptions makes the recommender system vulnerable to\nmanipulation by adversarial sellers on e-commerce platforms. In this paper, we\nexplore the possibility of such manipulation by proposing a new text rewriting\nframework to attack text-aware recommender systems. We show that the rewriting\nattack can be exploited by sellers to unfairly uprank their products, even\nthough the adversarially rewritten descriptions are perceived as realistic by\nhuman evaluators. Methodologically, we investigate two different variations to\ncarry out text rewriting attacks: (1) two-phase fine-tuning for greater attack\nperformance, and (2) in-context learning for higher text rewriting quality.\nExperiments spanning 3 different datasets and 4 existing approaches demonstrate\nthat recommender systems exhibit vulnerability against the proposed text\nrewriting attack. Our work adds to the existing literature around the\nrobustness of recommender systems, while highlighting a new dimension of\nvulnerability in the age of large-scale automated text generation.",

      "abstract": "Estimating the trace of powers of identical $k$ density matrices (i.e.,\n$\\text{Tr}(\\rho^k)$) is a crucial subroutine for many applications such as\ncalculating nonlinear functions of quantum states, preparing quantum Gibbs\nstates, and mitigating quantum errors. Reducing the requisite number of qubits\nand gates is essential to fit a quantum algorithm onto near-term quantum\ndevices. Inspired by the Newton-Girard method, we developed an algorithm that\nuses only $\\mathcal{O}(r)$ qubits and $\\mathcal{O}(r)$ multi-qubit gates, where\n$r$ is the rank of $\\rho$. We prove that the estimation of\n$\\{\\text{Tr}(\\rho^i)\\}_{i=1}^r$ is sufficient for estimating the trace of\npowers with large $k > r$. With these advantages, our algorithm brings the\nestimation of the trace of powers closer to the capabilities of near-term\nquantum processors. We show that our results can be generalized for estimating\n$\\text{Tr}(M\\rho^k)$, where $M$ is an arbitrary observable, and demonstrate the\nadvantages of our algorithm in several applications.",

The bouncing dynamics are insensitive of the\npotential and initial conditions, so that the expansion factor and the scalar\nfield can be described uniquely by a universal solution during this epoch.\nAfter about $10^5$ Planck time, the epoch of transition starts and the universe\nrapidly turns over from the kinetic energy dominated state to the potential\nenergy dominated one, whereby the slow-roll inflationary phase begins. In this\npaper, we consider the power law plateau potential and study the\npre-inflationary cosmology for different sets of initial conditions, so that\nduring the slow-roll inflation epoch enough e-folds will be produced.\nConsidering the generalized reheating and comparing with the recent Planck 2018\ndata, we are able to constrain the total number of e-folds ($N_T$) from the\nbounce till today to be consistent with the current observable universe.\nDepending on the matter driving the reheating (subject to the different\ndominant equations of states), we report the observationally allowed $N_T$ and\nreheating temperature and find in particular $N_T \\simeq 127$, which is\nsignificantly different from the one $N_T \\gtrsim 141$ obtained previously\nwithout considering the reheating phase.",

Through the extended bulk thermodynamics for the\nfive-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole, we derive the first law of the\nCFT thermodynamics which is obtained by directly translating the arbitrary\nconformal factors in the dual CFT.

The self-intersection point of the\nHelmholtz free energy indicates the phase transition between the high and low\nentropy states of the CFT.

It is still unclear whether all the radio-loud active galactic\nnuclei (RLAGNs) with a thin disk and strong radio emissions contain a MAD. We\ninvestigate this issue by utilizing the 3CRR catalog. We compile a sample of 35\nquasars and 14 high-excitation radio galaxies powered by a thin accretion disk.\nIn order to consistently compare with the MAD sample given by Li et al. (2022),\nthe optical-UV emissions of our sample are all detected by the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST). It is found that the average X-ray luminosity ($L_{\\rm X}$) of\nour sample is about 5.0 times higher than that of radio-quiet AGNs (RQAGNs)\nwith matching optical-UV luminosity ($L_{\\rm UV}$), in general accord with the\nfactor of 4.5 times in MAD sample within the uncertainty. The relationship\nbetween radio (5~GHz) and X-ray (2 keV) luminosities in the 3CRR sources is\nalso found to be consistent with the MAD sample. Furthermore, the jet\nefficiencies of 3CRR sources are consistent with those from the GRMHD\nsimulations of MAD. Therefore, we suggest that probably all the quasars and at\nleast a fraction of high-excitation radio galaxies in the 3CRR catalog, and\nperhaps all the RLAGNs with strong radio emissions contain a MAD.",

      "abstract": "For most existing prescribed performance formation control methods,\nperformance requirements are not directly imposed on the relative states\nbetween agents but on the consensus error, which lacks a clear physical\ninterpretation of their solution. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive\nprescribed performance formation control strategy, capable of guaranteeing\nprescribed performance on the relative errors, for uncertain high-order\nmulti-agent systems under a class of directed graphs. Due to the consideration\nof performance constraints for relative errors, a coupled nonlinear interaction\nterm that contains global graphic information among agents is involved in the\nerror dynamics, leading to a fully distributed control design more difficult\nand challenging. Here by proposing a series of nonlinear mappings and utilizing\nthe edge Laplacian along with Lyapunov stability theory, the presented\nformation control scheme exhibits the following appealing features when\ncompared to existing results: 1) different performance requirements can be\nguaranteed in a unified way by solely tuning the design parameters a priori,\nwithout the need for control redesign and stability reanalysis under the\nproposed fixed control protocol, making the design more user-friendly and the\nimplementation less demanding; 2) the complex and burdensome verification\nprocess for the initial constraint, often encountered in existing prescribed\nperformance controls, is completely obviated if the performance requirements\nare global; and 3) nonlinear interaction is completely decoupled and the\nasymptotic stability of the formation manifold is ensured via using the\nadaptive parameter estimate technique. Finally, simulations of various\nperformance behaviors are performed to show the efficiency of the theoretical\nresults.",

Traditional speech emotion recognition (SER) systems,\nwhich typically rely on a singular, precise emotion label, struggle with this\ncomplexity. Therefore, modeling the inherent ambiguity of emotions is an urgent\nproblem. In this paper, we propose an iterative prototype refinement framework\n(IPR) for ambiguous SER. IPR comprises two interlinked components: contrastive\nlearning and class prototypes. The former provides an efficient way to obtain\nhigh-quality representations of ambiguous samples. The latter are dynamically\nupdated based on ambiguous labels -- the similarity of the ambiguous data to\nall prototypes. These refined embeddings yield precise pseudo labels, thus\nreinforcing representation quality. Experimental evaluations conducted on the\nIEMOCAP dataset validate the superior performance of IPR over state-of-the-art\nmethods, thus proving the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

      "abstract": "To index the increasing volume of data, modern data indexes are typically\nstored on SSDs and cached in DRAM. However, searching such an index has\nresulted in significant I/O traffic due to limited access locality and\ninefficient cache utilization. At the heart of index searching is the operation\nof filtering through vast data spans to isolate a small, relevant subset, which\ninvolves basic equality tests rather than the complex arithmetic provided by\nmodern CPUs. This paper introduces the Search-in-Memory (SiM) chip, which\ndemonstrates the feasibility of performing data filtering directly within a\nNAND flash memory chip, transmitting only relevant search results rather than\ncomplete pages. Instead of adding complex circuits, we propose repurposing\nexisting circuitry for efficient and accurate bitwise parallel matching. We\ndemonstrate how different data structures can use our flexible SIMD command\ninterface to offload index searches. This strategy not only frees up the CPU\nfor more computationally demanding tasks, but it also optimizes DRAM usage for\nwrite buffering, significantly lowering energy consumption associated with I/O\ntransmission between the CPU and DRAM. Extensive testing across a wide range of\nworkloads reveals up to a 9X speedup in write-heavy workloads and up to 45%\nenergy savings due to reduced read and write I/O. Furthermore, we achieve\nsignificant reductions in median and tail read latencies of up to 89% and 85%\nrespectively.",

Empirical methods such as adversarial training can defend against\nparticular attacks but remain vulnerable to more powerful attacks.\nAlternatively, Lipschitz networks provide certified robustness to unseen\nperturbations but lack sufficient expressive power. To harness the advantages\nof both approaches, we design a novel two-step Optimal Transport induced\nAdversarial Defense (OTAD) model that can fit the training data accurately\nwhile preserving the local Lipschitz continuity. First, we train a DNN with a\nregularizer derived from optimal transport theory, yielding a discrete optimal\ntransport map linking data to its features. By leveraging the map's inherent\nregularity, we interpolate the map by solving the convex integration problem\n(CIP) to guarantee the local Lipschitz property. OTAD is extensible to diverse\narchitectures of ResNet and Transformer, making it suitable for complex data.\nFor efficient computation, the CIP can be solved through training neural\nnetworks. OTAD opens a novel avenue for developing reliable and secure deep\nlearning systems through the regularity of optimal transport maps.

In the context\nof group fairness, this approach often obscures implicit assumptions about how\nbias is introduced into the data. For instance, in binary classification, it is\noften assumed that the best model, with equal fairness, is the one with better\nperformance. However, this belief already imposes specific properties on the\nprocess that introduced bias. More precisely, we are already assuming that the\nbiasing process is a monotonic function of the fair scores, dependent solely on\nthe sensitive attribute. We formally prove this claim regarding several\nimplicit fairness assumptions. This leads, in our view, to two possible\nconclusions: either the behavior of the biasing process is more complex than\nmere monotonicity, which means we need to identify and reject our implicit\nassumptions in order to develop models capable of tackling more complex\nsituations; or the bias introduced in the data behaves predictably, implying\nthat many of the developed models are superfluous.",

      "title": "Cybloids $-$ Creation and Control of Cybernetic Colloids",
      "abstract": "Colloids play an important role in fundamental science as well as in nature\nand technology. They have had a strong impact on the fundamental understanding\nof statistical physics. For example, colloids have helped to obtain a better\nunderstanding of collective phenomena, ranging from phase transitions and glass\nformation to the swarming of active Brownian particles. Yet the success of\ncolloidal systems hinges crucially on the specific physical and chemical\nproperties of the colloidal particles, i.e. particles with the appropriate\ncharacteristics must be available. Here we present an idea to create particles\nwith freely selectable properties. The properties might depend, for example, on\nthe presence of other particles (hence mimicking specific pair or many-body\ninteractions), previous configurations (hence introducing some memory or\nfeedback), or a directional bias (hence changing the dynamics). Without\ndirectly interfering with the sample, each particle is fully controlled and can\nreceive external commands through a predefined algorithm that can take into\naccount any input parameters. This is realized with computer-controlled\ncolloids, which we term cybloids - short for cybernetic colloids. The potential\nof cybloids is illustrated by programming a time-delayed external potential\nacting on a single colloid and interaction potentials for many colloids. Both\nan attractive harmonic potential and an annular potential are implemented. For\na single particle, this programming can cause subdiffusive behavior or lend\nactivity. For many colloids, the programmed interaction potential allows to\nselect a crystal structure at wish. Beyond these examples, we discuss further\nopportunities which cybloids offer.",

      "abstract": "Due to the visual properties of reflection and refraction, RGB-D cameras\ncannot accurately capture the depth of transparent objects, leading to\nincomplete depth maps. To fill in the missing points, recent studies tend to\nexplore new visual features and design complex networks to reconstruct the\ndepth, however, these approaches tremendously increase computation, and the\ncorrelation of different visual features remains a problem. To this end, we\npropose an efficient depth completion network named DistillGrasp which\ndistillates knowledge from the teacher branch to the student branch.\nSpecifically, in the teacher branch, we design a position correlation block\n(PCB) that leverages RGB images as the query and key to search for the\ncorresponding values, guiding the model to establish correct correspondence\nbetween two features and transfer it to the transparent areas. For the student\nbranch, we propose a consistent feature correlation module (CFCM) that retains\nthe reliable regions of RGB images and depth maps respectively according to the\nconsistency and adopts a CNN to capture the pairwise relationship for depth\ncompletion. To avoid the student branch only learning regional features from\nthe teacher branch, we devise a distillation loss that not only considers the\ndistance loss but also the object structure and edge information. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on the ClearGrasp dataset manifest that our teacher\nnetwork outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and\ngeneralization, and the student network achieves competitive results with a\nhigher speed of 48 FPS. In addition, the significant improvement in a\nreal-world robotic grasping system illustrates the effectiveness and robustness\nof our proposed system.",

      "abstract": "Current visual navigation systems often treat the environment as static,\nlacking the ability to adaptively interact with obstacles. This limitation\nleads to navigation failure when encountering unavoidable obstructions. In\nresponse, we introduce IN-Sight, a novel approach to self-supervised path\nplanning, enabling more effective navigation strategies through interaction\nwith obstacles. Utilizing RGB-D observations, IN-Sight calculates\ntraversability scores and incorporates them into a semantic map, facilitating\nlong-range path planning in complex, maze-like environments. To precisely\nnavigate around obstacles, IN-Sight employs a local planner, trained\nimperatively on a differentiable costmap using representation learning\ntechniques. The entire framework undergoes end-to-end training within the\nstate-of-the-art photorealistic Intel SPEAR Simulator. We validate the\neffectiveness of IN-Sight through extensive benchmarking in a variety of\nsimulated scenarios and ablation studies. Moreover, we demonstrate the system's\nreal-world applicability with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, deploying our\nplanner on the legged robot platform ANYmal, showcasing its practical potential\nfor interactive navigation in real environments.",

Indeed, for many applications, the target sound signal and its\nspatial cues carry important information about the sound source. Binaural TSE\ncan be realized with a neural network trained to output only the desired sound\ngiven a binaural mixture and an embedding characterizing the desired sound\nclass as inputs. Conventional TSE systems are trained using signal-level\nlosses, which measure the difference between the extracted and reference\nsignals for the left and right channels.

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of the short video industry, traditional\ne-commerce has encountered a new paradigm, video-driven e-commerce, which\nleverages attractive videos for product showcases and provides both video and\nitem services for users. Benefitting from the dynamic and visualized\nintroduction of items,video-driven e-commerce has shown huge potential in\nstimulating consumer confidence and promoting sales. In this paper, we focus on\nthe video retrieval task, facing the following challenges: (1) Howto handle the\nheterogeneities among users, items, and videos? (2)How to mine the\ncomplementarity between items and videos for better user understanding? In this\npaper, we first leverage the dual graph to model the co-existing of user-video\nand user-item interactions in video-driven e-commerce and innovatively reduce\nuser preference understanding to a graph matching problem. To solve it, we\nfurther propose a novel bi-level Graph Matching Network(GMN), which mainly\nconsists of node- and preference-level graph matching. Given a user, node-level\ngraph matching aims to match videos and items, while preference-level graph\nmatching aims to match multiple user preferences extracted from both videos and\nitems. Then the proposed GMN can generate and improve user embedding by\naggregating matched nodes or preferences from the dual graph in a bi-level\nmanner. Comprehensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed GMN with\nsignificant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., AUC+1.9% and\nCTR+7.15%). We have developed it on a well-known video-driven e-commerce\nplatform, serving hundreds of millions of users every day",

      "title": "Hierarchically Structured Neural Bones for Reconstructing Animatable\n  Objects from Casual Videos",
      "abstract": "We propose a new framework for creating and easily manipulating 3D models of\narbitrary objects using casually captured videos. Our core ingredient is a\nnovel hierarchy deformation model, which captures motions of objects with a\ntree-structured bones. Our hierarchy system decomposes motions based on the\ngranularity and reveals the correlations between parts without exploiting any\nprior structural knowledge. We further propose to regularize the bones to be\npositioned at the basis of motions, centers of parts, sufficiently covering\nrelated surfaces of the part. This is achieved by our bone occupancy function,\nwhich identifies whether a given 3D point is placed within the bone. Coupling\nthe proposed components, our framework offers several clear advantages: (1)\nusers can obtain animatable 3D models of the arbitrary objects in improved\nquality from their casual videos, (2) users can manipulate 3D models in an\nintuitive manner with minimal costs, and (3) users can interactively add or\ndelete control points as necessary. The experimental results demonstrate the\nefficacy of our framework on diverse instances, in reconstruction quality,\ninterpretability and easier manipulation.

      "title": "Autonomous LLM-Enhanced Adversarial Attack for Text-to-Motion",
      "abstract": "Human motion generation driven by deep generative models has enabled\ncompelling applications, but the ability of text-to-motion (T2M) models to\nproduce realistic motions from text prompts raises security concerns if\nexploited maliciously. Despite growing interest in T2M, few methods focus on\nsafeguarding these models against adversarial attacks, with existing work on\ntext-to-image models proving insufficient for the unique motion domain. In the\npaper, we propose ALERT-Motion, an autonomous framework leveraging large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to craft targeted adversarial attacks against black-box\nT2M models. Unlike prior methods modifying prompts through predefined rules,\nALERT-Motion uses LLMs' knowledge of human motion to autonomously generate\nsubtle yet powerful adversarial text descriptions. It comprises two key\nmodules: an adaptive dispatching module that constructs an LLM-based agent to\niteratively refine and search for adversarial prompts; and a multimodal\ninformation contrastive module that extracts semantically relevant motion\ninformation to guide the agent's search. Through this LLM-driven approach,\nALERT-Motion crafts adversarial prompts querying victim models to produce\noutputs closely matching targeted motions, while avoiding obvious\nperturbations. Evaluations across popular T2M models demonstrate ALERT-Motion's\nsuperiority over previous methods, achieving higher attack success rates with\nstealthier adversarial prompts. This pioneering work on T2M adversarial attacks\nhighlights the urgency of developing defensive measures as motion generation\ntechnology advances, urging further research into safe and responsible\ndeployment.",

      "abstract": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained models is a common practice in machine learning\napplications, yet its mathematical analysis remains largely unexplored. In this\npaper, we study fine-tuning through the lens of memorization capacity. Our new\nmeasure, the Fine-Tuning Capacity (FTC), is defined as the maximum number of\nsamples a neural network can fine-tune, or equivalently, as the minimum number\nof neurons ($m$) needed to arbitrarily change $N$ labels among $K$ samples\nconsidered in the fine-tuning process. In essence, FTC extends the memorization\ncapacity concept to the fine-tuning scenario. We analyze FTC for the additive\nfine-tuning scenario where the fine-tuned network is defined as the summation\nof the frozen pre-trained network $f$ and a neural network $g$ (with $m$\nneurons) designed for fine-tuning. When $g$ is a ReLU network with either 2 or\n3 layers, we obtain tight upper and lower bounds on FTC; we show that $N$\nsamples can be fine-tuned with $m=\\Theta(N)$ neurons for 2-layer networks, and\nwith $m=\\Theta(\\sqrt{N})$ neurons for 3-layer networks, no matter how large $K$\nis.

We propose a new methodology to use the observed time delay of these\nsources to constrain the speed of gravity that is, the propagation speed of\ngravitational waves, the Hubble constant and the prompt time delay distribution\nbetween GWs and sGRBs, even though a direct redshift estimation from the host\ngalaxy is unavailable. Our method exploits the intrinsic relation between GWs\nand sGRBs observed and prompt time delays to obtain a statistical redshift\nmeasure for the cosmological sources. We show that this technique can be used\nto infer the Hubble constant at the $10\\%$~level of precision with\nfuture-generation GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and only 100\nobservations of this kind. The novel procedure that we propose has systematics\nthat differ completely from the ones of previous GW methods for cosmology.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate for the first time that the speed of gravity and\nthe distribution of the prompt time-delays between GWs and sGRBs can be\ninferred conjointly with less than 10 sources even with current GW detector\nsensitivities.",

      "abstract": "Protein function prediction is a crucial task in bioinformatics, with\nsignificant implications for understanding biological processes and disease\nmechanisms. While the relationship between sequence and function has been\nextensively explored, translating protein structure to function continues to\npresent substantial challenges. Various models, particularly, CNN and\ngraph-based deep learning approaches that integrate structural and functional\ndata, have been proposed to address these challenges. However, these methods\noften fall short in elucidating the functional significance of key residues\nessential for protein functionality, as they predominantly adopt a\nretrospective perspective, leading to suboptimal performance.\n  Inspired by region proposal networks in computer vision, we introduce the\nProtein Region Proposal Network (ProteinRPN) for accurate protein function\nprediction. Specifically, the region proposal module component of ProteinRPN\nidentifies potential functional regions (anchors) which are refined through the\nhierarchy-aware node drop pooling layer favoring nodes with defined secondary\nstructures and spatial proximity. The representations of the predicted\nfunctional nodes are enriched using attention mechanisms and subsequently fed\ninto a Graph Multiset Transformer, which is trained with supervised contrastive\n(SupCon) and InfoNCE losses on perturbed protein structures. Our model\ndemonstrates significant improvements in predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms,\neffectively localizing functional residues within protein structures. The\nproposed framework provides a robust, scalable solution for protein function\nannotation, advancing the understanding of protein structure-function\nrelationships in computational biology.",

This study investigates the differences between entity\nand relational knowledge through knowledge editing. Our findings reveal that\nentity and relational knowledge cannot be directly transferred or mapped to\neach other. This result is unexpected, as logically, modifying the entity or\nthe relation within the same knowledge triplet should yield equivalent\noutcomes. To further elucidate the differences between entity and relational\nknowledge, we employ causal analysis to investigate how relational knowledge is\nstored in pre-trained models. Contrary to prior research suggesting that\nknowledge is stored in MLP weights, our experiments demonstrate that relational\nknowledge is also significantly encoded in attention modules.

      "abstract": "Multi-modal 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) typically necessitates extensive\ncomputational costs of deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract multi-modal\nrepresentations. In this paper, we propose an intriguing question: May we learn\nfrom multiple modalities only during training to avoid multi-modal input in the\ninference phase? To answer it, we propose \\textbf{YOLOO}, a novel multi-modal\n3D MOT paradigm: You Only Learn from Others Once. YOLOO empowers the point\ncloud encoder to learn a unified tri-modal representation (UTR) from point\nclouds and other modalities, such as images and textual cues, all at once.\nLeveraging this UTR, YOLOO achieves efficient tracking solely using the point\ncloud encoder without compromising its performance, fundamentally obviating the\nneed for computationally intensive DNNs. Specifically, YOLOO includes two core\ncomponents: a unified tri-modal encoder (UTEnc) and a flexible geometric\nconstraint (F-GC) module. UTEnc integrates a point cloud encoder with image and\ntext encoders adapted from pre-trained CLIP. It seamlessly fuses point cloud\ninformation with rich visual-textual knowledge from CLIP into the point cloud\nencoder, yielding highly discriminative UTRs that facilitate the association\nbetween trajectories and detections. Additionally, F-GC filters out mismatched\nassociations with similar representations but significant positional\ndiscrepancies. It further enhances the robustness of UTRs without requiring any\nscene-specific tuning, addressing a key limitation of customized geometric\nconstraints (e.g., 3D IoU). Lastly, high-quality 3D trajectories are generated\nby a traditional data association component. By integrating these advancements\ninto a multi-modal 3D MOT scheme, our YOLOO achieves substantial gains in both\nrobustness and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "For a cell-bulk ODE-PDE model in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, a hybrid\nasymptotic-numerical theory is developed to provide a new theoretical and\ncomputationally efficient approach for studying how oscillatory dynamics\nassociated with spatially segregated dynamically active ``units\" or ``cells\"\nare regulated by a PDE bulk diffusion field that is both produced and absorbed\nby the entire cell population. The study of oscillator synchronization in a PDE\ndiffusion field was one of the initial aims of Yoshiki Kuramoto's foundational\nwork. For this cell-bulk model, strong localized perturbation theory, as\nextended to a time-dependent setting, is used to derive a new\nintegro-differential ODE system that characterizes intracellular dynamics in a\nmemory-dependent bulk-diffusion field. For this nonlocal reduced system, a\nnovel fast time-marching scheme, relying in part on the\n\\emph{sum-of-exponentials method} to numerically treat convolution integrals,\nis developed to rapidly and accurately compute numerical solutions to the\nintegro-differential system over long time intervals. For the special case of\nSel'kov reaction kinetics, a wide variety of large-scale oscillatory dynamical\nbehavior including phase synchronization, mixed-mode oscillations, and\nquorum-sensing are illustrated for various ranges of the influx and efflux\npermeability parameters, the bulk degradation rate and bulk diffusivity, and\nthe specific spatial configuration of cells. Results from our fast algorithm,\nobtained in under one minute of CPU time on a laptop, are benchmarked against\nPDE simulations of the cell-bulk model, which are performed with a commercial\nPDE solver, that have run-times that are orders of magnitude larger.",

In this timely context, we focus on broadcast\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and aim to characterize their\nenergy efficiency (EE) performance. To gain a comprehensive understanding of\nthe potential of SIM, we consider both dirty paper coding (DPC) and linear\nprecoding and formulate the corresponding EE maximization problems. For DPC, we\nemploy the broadcast channel (BC)-multiple-access channel (MAC) duality to\nobtain an equivalent problem, and optimize users' covariance matrices using the\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) method, which is based on a tight lower\nbound of the achievable sum-rate, in combination with Dinkelbach's method.\nSince optimizing the phase shifts of the SIM meta-elements is an optimization\nproblem of extremely large size, we adopt a conventional projected\ngradient-based method for its simplicity. A similar approach is derived for the\ncase of linear precoding. Simulation results show that the proposed\noptimization methods for the considered SIM-based systems can significantly\nimprove the EE, compared to the conventional counterparts.

For evaluating software summarization approaches, human judgment is\nstill the most trusted evaluation. However, it is time-consuming and fatiguing\nfor evaluators, making it challenging to scale and reproduce. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various software\nengineering tasks, motivating us to explore their potential as automatic\nevaluators for approaches that aim to summarize software artifacts. In this\nstudy, we investigate whether LLMs can evaluate bug report summarization\neffectively. We conducted an experiment in which we presented the same set of\nbug summarization problems to humans and three LLMs (GPT-4o, LLaMA-3, and\nGemini) for evaluation on two tasks: selecting the correct bug report title and\nbug report summary from a set of options.

Our results indicate that LLMs demonstrate potential for being considered\nas automated evaluators for bug report summarization, which could allow scaling\nup evaluations while reducing human evaluators effort and fatigue.",

      "abstract": "Slow inference speed is one of the most crucial concerns for deploying\nmulti-view 3D detectors to tasks with high real-time requirements like\nautonomous driving. Although many sparse query-based methods have already\nattempted to improve the efficiency of 3D detectors, they neglect to consider\nthe backbone, especially when using Vision Transformers (ViT) for better\nperformance. To tackle this problem, we explore the efficient ViT backbones for\nmulti-view 3D detection via token compression and propose a simple yet\neffective method called TokenCompression3D (ToC3D). By leveraging history\nobject queries as foreground priors of high quality, modeling 3D motion\ninformation in them, and interacting them with image tokens through the\nattention mechanism, ToC3D can effectively determine the magnitude of\ninformation densities of image tokens and segment the salient foreground\ntokens. With the introduced dynamic router design, ToC3D can weigh more\ncomputing resources to important foreground tokens while compressing the\ninformation loss, leading to a more efficient ViT-based multi-view 3D detector.\nExtensive results on the large-scale nuScenes dataset show that our method can\nnearly maintain the performance of recent SOTA with up to 30% inference\nspeedup, and the improvements are consistent after scaling up the ViT and input\nresolution.

      "abstract": "We investigate continuous generation of bubbles from a bath of air in viscous\nliquid in a confined geometry. In our original setup, bubbles are spontaneously\ngenerated by virtue of buoyancy and a gate placed in the cell: the gate acts\nlike an inverted funnel trapping air beneath it before continuously generating\nbubbles at the tip. The dynamics is characterized by the period of the bubble\nformation and the size of bubbles as a function of the amount of air under the\ngate. By analyzing the data obtained for various parameters, we successfully\nidentified in a clear manner that the dynamics of the bubble formation is\ngoverned by dissipation in thin films whose thickness is determined by\nDerjaguin's law balanced by a gravitational energy change due to buoyancy,\nafter examining numerous possibilities of dissipation, demonstrating the\npotential of scaling analysis even in extremely complex cases. Furthermore, we\nuncover a novel type of pinch-off condition, which convincingly explains the\nsize of the bubble created: in the present case viscosity plays a vital role\nbeyond the conventional mechanism of Tate in which gravity competes with\ncapillarity, revealing a general mechanism of pinching-off at low Reynolds\nnumber. Accordingly, the present study significantly and fundamentally advance\nour knowledge of bubble generation and bubble pinch-off in a clear manner with\nthe results relevant for a wide variety of applications in many fields. In\nparticular, the present study demonstrates a new avenue in microfluidics for\nunderstanding physical principles by scaling up the system, without losing the\ncharacters of the flow at low Reynolds numbers.",

      "title": "IGEV++: Iterative Multi-range Geometry Encoding Volumes for Stereo\n  Matching",
      "abstract": "Stereo matching is a core component in many computer vision and robotics\nsystems. Despite significant advances over the last decade, handling matching\nambiguities in ill-posed regions and large disparities remains an open\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose a new deep network architecture, called\nIGEV++, for stereo matching. The proposed IGEV++ builds Multi-range Geometry\nEncoding Volumes (MGEV) that encode coarse-grained geometry information for\nill-posed regions and large disparities and fine-grained geometry information\nfor details and small disparities. To construct MGEV, we introduce an adaptive\npatch matching module that efficiently and effectively computes matching costs\nfor large disparity ranges and/or ill-posed regions. We further propose a\nselective geometry feature fusion module to adaptively fuse multi-range and\nmulti-granularity geometry features in MGEV. We then index the fused geometry\nfeatures and input them to ConvGRUs to iteratively update the disparity map.\nMGEV allows to efficiently handle large disparities and ill-posed regions, such\nas occlusions and textureless regions, and enjoys rapid convergence during\niterations. Our IGEV++ achieves the best performance on the Scene Flow test set\nacross all disparity ranges, up to 768px. Our IGEV++ also achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on the Middlebury, ETH3D, KITTI 2012, and 2015\nbenchmarks. Specifically, IGEV++ achieves a 3.23% 2-pixel outlier rate (Bad\n2.0) on the large disparity benchmark, Middlebury, representing error\nreductions of 31.9% and 54.8% compared to RAFT-Stereo and GMStereo,\nrespectively. We also present a real-time version of IGEV++ that achieves the\nbest performance among all published real-time methods on the KITTI benchmarks.\nThe code is publicly available at https://github.com/gangweiX/IGEV-plusplus",

      "abstract": "The escalating global mortality and morbidity rates associated with\ngastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, compounded by the complexities and limitations\nof traditional endoscopic methods, underscore the urgent need for a critical\nreview of current methodologies used for addressing this condition. With an\nestimated 300,000 annual deaths worldwide, the demand for innovative diagnostic\nand therapeutic strategies is paramount. The introduction of Video Capsule\nEndoscopy (VCE) has marked a significant advancement, offering a comprehensive,\nnon-invasive visualization of the digestive tract that is pivotal for detecting\nbleeding sources unattainable by traditional methods. Despite its benefits, the\nefficacy of VCE is hindered by diagnostic challenges, including time-consuming\nanalysis and susceptibility to human error. This backdrop sets the stage for\nexploring Machine Learning (ML) applications in automating GI bleeding\ndetection within capsule endoscopy, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy,\nreduce manual labor, and improve patient outcomes. Through an exhaustive\nanalysis of 113 papers published between 2008 and 2023, this review assesses\nthe current state of ML methodologies in bleeding detection, highlighting their\neffectiveness, challenges, and prospective directions. It contributes an\nin-depth examination of AI techniques in VCE frame analysis, offering insights\ninto open-source datasets, mathematical performance metrics, and technique\ncategorization.

Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for\ntraversability prediction but faces predictive uncertainty. This uncertainty\nleads to prediction errors, increasing the risk of wheel slips and\nimmobilization for planetary rovers. To address this issue, we integrate\nprincipal approaches to uncertainty handling -- quantification, exploitation,\nand adaptation -- into a single learning and planning framework for rover\nnavigation. The key concept is \\emph{deep probabilistic traversability},\nforming the basis of an end-to-end probabilistic ML model that predicts slip\ndistributions directly from rover traverse observations. This probabilistic\nmodel quantifies uncertainties in slip prediction and exploits them as\ntraversability costs in path planning. Its end-to-end nature also allows\nadaptation of pre-trained models with in-situ traverse experience to reduce\nuncertainties. We perform extensive simulations in synthetic environments that\npose representative uncertainties in planetary analog terrains. Experimental\nresults show that our method achieves more robust path planning under novel\nenvironmental conditions than existing approaches.",

In classical physics, the Fisher information determines the maximum\nextractable information from statistically unknown signals, based on a joint\nprobability density function of independently and identically distributed\nrandom variables. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) indicates the minimum error\nof the Fisher information, generally known as the shot-noise limit. On the\nother hand, coherence has pushed the resolution limit further overcoming the\ndiffraction limit using many-wave interference strictly confined to the\nfirst-order intensity correlation. However, practical implementation is limited\nby the lithographic constraints in, e.g., optical gratings. Recently, a\ncoherence technique of superresolution has been introduced to overcome the\ndiffraction limit in phase sensitivity using higher-order intensity\ncorrelations of a phase-controlled output field from an interferometer. Here,\nthe superresolution is adopted for precision metrology in an optical\nspectrometer, whose enhanced frequency resolution is linearly proportional to\nthe intensity-product order, overcoming CRLB. Unlike quantum sensing using\nentangled photons, this technique is purely classical and offers robust\nperformance against environmental noises, benefiting from the interferometer\nscanning mode for fringe counting.",

      "abstract": "Physics-informed deep learning (PIDL)-based models have recently garnered\nremarkable success in traffic state estimation (TSE). However, the prior\nknowledge used to guide regularization training in current mainstream\narchitectures is based on deterministic physical models. The drawback is that a\nsolely deterministic model fails to capture the universally observed traffic\nflow dynamic scattering effect, thereby yielding unreliable outcomes for\ntraffic control. This study, for the first time, proposes stochastic\nphysics-informed deep learning (SPIDL) for traffic state estimation. The idea\nbehind such SPIDL is simple and is based on the fact that a stochastic\nfundamental diagram provides the entire range of possible speeds for any given\ndensity with associated probabilities. Specifically, we select percentile-based\nfundamental diagram and distribution-based fundamental diagram as stochastic\nphysics knowledge, and design corresponding physics-uninformed neural networks\nfor effective fusion, thereby realizing two specific SPIDL models, namely\n\\text{$\\alpha$}-SPIDL and \\text{$\\cal B$}-SPIDL. The main contribution of SPIDL\nlies in addressing the \"overly centralized guidance\" caused by the one-to-one\nspeed-density relationship in deterministic models during neural network\ntraining, enabling the network to digest more reliable knowledge-based\nconstraints.Experiments on the real-world dataset indicate that proposed SPIDL\nmodels achieve accurate traffic state estimation in sparse data scenarios. More\nimportantly, as expected, SPIDL models reproduce well the scattering effect of\nfield observations, demonstrating the effectiveness of fusing stochastic\nphysics model knowledge with deep learning frameworks.",

In this paper, we consider this problem for $m$-Cayley\ndigraphs which are generalization of Cayley digraphs. Let $m$ be a positive\ninteger. A digraph admitting a group $G$ of automorphisms acting semiregularly\non the vertices with exactly $m$ orbits is called an $m$-Cayley digraph of $G$.\nIn particular, $1$-Cayley digraph is just the Cayley digraph. We first\ncharacterize the normalizer of $G$ in the full automorphism group of an\n$m$-Cayley digraph of a finite group $G$. This generalizes a similar result for\nCayley digraph achieved by Godsil in 1981. Then we use this to study the\nisomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs. The CI-property of a Cayley digraph (CI\nstands for `Cayley isomorphism') and the DCI-groups (whose Cayley digraphs are\nall CI-digraphs) are two key topics in the study of isomorphisms of Cayley\ndigraphs. We generalize these concepts into $m$-Cayley digraphs by defining\n$m$CI- and $m$PCI-digraphs, and correspondingly, $m$DCI- and $m$PDCI-groups.\nAnalogues to Babai's criterion for CI-digraphs are given for $m$CI- and\n$m$PCI-digraphs, respectively.

The\nperiod during which this process takes place defines a \"Kasner eon\", which\ncomes to an end when higher-curvature or quantum effects become relevant. When\nhigher-curvature densities are included in the action, spacetime can undergo\ntransitions into additional Kasner eons. During each eon, the metric behaves\nlocally as a Kasner solution to the higher-curvature density controlling the\ndynamics. In this paper we identify the presence of Kasner eons in the interior\nof static and spherically symmetric Lovelock gravity black holes. We determine\nthe conditions under which eons occur and study the Kasner metrics which\ncharacterize them, as well as the transitions between them. We show that the\nnull energy condition implies a monotonicity property for the effective Kasner\nexponent at the end of the Einsteinian eon. We also characterize the Kasner\nsolutions of more general higher-curvature theories of gravity. In particular,\nwe observe that the Einstein gravity condition that the sum of the Kasner\nexponents adds up to one, $\\sum_{i=1}^{D-1}p_i=1$, admits a universal\ngeneralization in the form of a family of Kasner metrics satisfying\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{D-1}p_i=2n -1$ which exists for any order-$n$ higher-curvature\ndensity and in general dimensions.",

      "title": "Adapting Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Bifurcation Detection in\n  Ecological Migration Models",
      "abstract": "In this study, we explore the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks\n(PINNs) to the analysis of bifurcation phenomena in ecological migration\nmodels. By integrating the fundamental principles of\ndiffusion-advection-reaction equations with deep learning techniques, we\naddress the complexities of species migration dynamics, particularly focusing\non the detection and analysis of Hopf bifurcations. Traditional numerical\nmethods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) often involve\nintricate calculations and extensive computational resources, which can be\nrestrictive in high-dimensional problems. In contrast, PINNs offer a more\nflexible and efficient alternative, bypassing the need for grid discretization\nand allowing for mesh-free solutions. Our approach leverages the DeepXDE\nframework, which enhances the computational efficiency and applicability of\nPINNs in solving high-dimensional PDEs. We validate our results against\nconventional methods and demonstrate that PINNs not only provide accurate\nbifurcation predictions but also offer deeper insights into the underlying\ndynamics of diffusion processes. Despite these advantages, the study also\nidentifies challenges such as the high computational costs and the sensitivity\nof PINN performance to network architecture and hyperparameter settings. Future\nwork will focus on optimizing these algorithms and expanding their application\nto other complex systems involving bifurcations. The findings from this\nresearch have significant implications for the modeling and analysis of\necological systems, providing a powerful tool for predicting and understanding\ncomplex dynamical behaviors.",

However, the\ncomputation of their global optima often faces NP-hardness, and thus only\nlocally optimal solutions may be obtained at best. In this work, we consider\nthe discrete-time finite-horizon optimal control problem in both deterministic\nand stochastic cases and study the optimization landscapes associated with two\ndifferent approaches: one-shot and DP. In the deterministic case, we prove that\neach local minimizer of the one-shot optimization corresponds to some control\ninput induced by a locally minimum control policy of DP, and vice versa.\nHowever, with a parameterized policy approach, we prove that deterministic and\nstochastic cases both exhibit the desirable property that each local minimizer\nof DP corresponds to some local minimizer of the one-shot optimization, but the\nconverse does not necessarily hold. Nonetheless, under different technical\nassumptions for deterministic and stochastic cases, if there exists only a\nsingle locally minimum control policy, one-shot and DP turn out to capture the\nsame local solution. These results pave the way to understand the performance\nand stability of local search methods in optimal control.",

To overcome this kind of uncertainty and to make the\nlabor market more comprehensible, we must employ labor market intelligence\ntechniques, which are predominantly based on data analysis.

Two scenarios of $c_{\\beta-\\alpha} > 0$ and $c_{\\beta-\\alpha} < 0$\nare studied in further detail. The factors give a different behavior from\nconsidering these scenarios. As a result, discriminations for the\nabove-mentioned scenarios can be performed at future colliders.",

      "title": "Effect of UV light irradiation on charge neutralization in XPS\n  measurements",
      "abstract": "When XPS analyses are performed on insulator surfaces, shift and deformation\nof spectra peaks typically take place due to the surface charging. To achieve\nreliable XPS measurements, neutralization techniques have been widely adopted\nbut their effectiveness are still limited, and thus, new neutralization\ntechnologies are urgently needed. Here, stable XPS spectra in which all the\npeaks undergo a reduced and nearly constant shift without significant\ndeformation and broadening were obtained by introducing the UV light\nirradiation, implying that the introduction of the UV light can not only\ngreatly attenuate the strength but also significantly improve both the temporal\nstability and the spatial uniformity of the surface charging during XPS\nmeasurements. This phenomenon, referred to as UV-assisted neutralization in\nthis article, was found as effective as the most commonly used dual beam charge\nneutralization. Further observations show that the suppression of the charging\nissue comes from the adsorption of the UV-excited photoelectrons onto the X-ray\nirradiation region. This neutralization method, combined with the binding\nenergy referencing, can be expected to become a promising alternative technique\nfor solving the charging issues in XPS measurements.",

They autonomously infect, propagate, and\ncoordinate to conduct cybercrimes, necessitating robust detection methods. This\nresearch addresses the sophisticated adversarial manipulations posed by\nattackers, aiming to undermine machine learning-based botnet detection systems.\nWe introduce a flow-based detection approach, leveraging machine learning and\ndeep learning algorithms trained on the ISCX and ISOT datasets.

      "abstract": "Graph partitioning (GP) is a classic problem that divides the node set of a\ngraph into densely-connected blocks. Following the IEEE HPEC Graph Challenge\nand recent advances in pre-training techniques (e.g., large-language models),\nwe propose PR-GPT (Pre-trained & Refined Graph ParTitioning) based on a novel\npre-training & refinement paradigm. We first conduct the offline pre-training\nof a deep graph learning (DGL) model on small synthetic graphs with various\ntopology properties. By using the inductive inference of DGL, one can directly\ngeneralize the pre-trained model (with frozen model parameters) to large graphs\nand derive feasible GP results. We also use the derived partition as a good\ninitialization of an efficient GP method (e.g., InfoMap) to further refine the\nquality of partitioning. In this setting, the online generalization and\nrefinement of PR-GPT can not only benefit from the transfer ability regarding\nquality but also ensure high inference efficiency without re-training. Based on\na mechanism of reducing the scale of a graph to be processed by the refinement\nmethod, PR-GPT also has the potential to support streaming GP. Experiments on\nthe Graph Challenge benchmark demonstrate that PR-GPT can ensure faster GP on\nlarge-scale graphs without significant quality degradation, compared with\nrunning a refinement method from scratch.

      "abstract": "Photometric stereo typically demands intricate data acquisition setups\ninvolving multiple light sources to recover surface normals accurately. In this\npaper, we propose MERLiN, an attention-based hourglass network that integrates\nsingle image-based inverse rendering and relighting within a single unified\nframework. We evaluate the performance of photometric stereo methods using\nthese relit images and demonstrate how they can circumvent the underlying\nchallenge of complex data acquisition. Our physically-based model is trained on\na large synthetic dataset containing complex shapes with spatially varying BRDF\nand is designed to handle indirect illumination effects to improve material\nreconstruction and relighting. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative\nevaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed framework generalizes well to\nreal-world images, achieving high-quality shape, material estimation, and\nrelighting. We assess these synthetically relit images over photometric stereo\nbenchmark methods for their physical correctness and resulting normal\nestimation accuracy, paving the way towards single-shot photometric stereo\nthrough physically-based relighting. This work allows us to address the single\nimage-based inverse rendering problem holistically, applying well to both\nsynthetic and real data and taking a step towards mitigating the challenge of\ndata acquisition in photometric stereo.",

      "abstract": "The study of exoplanets at different evolutionary stages can shed light on\ntheir formation, migration, and evolution. The determination of exoplanet\nproperties depends on the properties of their host stars. It is therefore\nimportant to characterise the host stars for accurate knowledge on their\nplanets. Our final goal is to derive, in a homogeneous and accurate way, the\nstellar atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of ten young TESS\ntransiting planet-hosting GK stars followed up with the HARPS-N at TNG\nspectrograph within the GAPS programme. We derived stellar kinematic\nproperties, atmospheric parameters, and abundances of 18 elements. Lithium line\nmeasurements were used as approximate age estimations. We exploited chemical\nabundances and their ratios to derive information on planetary composition.\nElemental abundances and kinematic properties are consistent with the nearby\nGalactic thin disk. All targets show C/O<0.8 and 1.0<Mg/Si<1.5, compatible with\nsilicate mantles made of a mixture of pyroxene and olivine assemblages. The\nFe/Mg ratios, with values of $\\sim$0.7-1.0, show a propensity for the planets\nto have big (iron) cores. All stars hosting very low-mass planets show Mg/Si\nvalues consistent with the Earth values, thus demonstrating their similar\nmantle composition. Hot Jupiter host stars show a lower content of O/Si, which\ncould be related to the lower presence of water content. We confirm a trend\nfound in the literature between stellar [O/Fe] and total planetary mass,\nimplying an important role of the O in shaping the mass fraction of heavy\nelements in stars and their disks. The detailed host star abundances provided\ncan be employed for further studies on the composition of the planets within\nthe current sample, when their atmospheres will be exploited.",

      "abstract": "Code generation leverages artificial intelligence technologies, particularly\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), to automatically produce source code, enhancing\nsoftware development efficiency and reducing repetitive tasks. However, the\nLLMs' generated code often fails to pass test cases and requires substantial\nhuman effort to fix errors. Previous studies focused on better prompts or\nimproving LLMs' capability but ignored why LLMs failed. In this paper, we first\nreproduced 14 LLMs, including GPT-3.5-turbo and 13 open-source LLMs, on the\nHumanEval dataset. We extracted 12,837 code generation errors and conducted an\nin-depth analysis of their causes, which led to the identification of 19\ndistinct error causes. Our empirical analysis indicated that three of these\ncauses can be directly fixed. Consequently, we proposed a fixing method called\nLlmFix, which addresses these three types of errors through a three-step\nprocess: filtering code for indentation correction, truncating redundant\ngenerated code, and importing missing modules. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat LlmFix can fix these three types of errors, significantly improving the\nperformance of 14 LLMs on HumanEval and MBPP datasets with average increases of\n9.5% and 5.4%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Particle creation terms in quantum Hamiltonians are usually ultraviolet\ndivergent and thus mathematically ill defined. A rather novel way of solving\nthis problem is based on imposing so-called interior-boundary conditions on the\nwave function. Previous papers showed that this approach works in the\nnon-relativistic regime, but particle creation is mostly relevant in the\nrelativistic case after all. In flat relativistic space-time (that is,\nneglecting gravity), the approach was previously found to work only for certain\nsomewhat artificial cases. Here, as a way of taking gravity into account, we\nconsider curved space-time, specifically the super-critical\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om space-time, which features a naked timelike singularity.\nWe find that the interior-boundary approach works fully in this setting; in\nparticular, we prove rigorously the existence of well-defined, self-adjoint\nHamiltonians with particle creation at the singularity, based on\ninterior-boundary conditions. We also non-rigorously analyze the asymptotic\nbehavior of the Bohmian trajectories and construct the corresponding Bohm-Bell\nprocess of particle creation, motion, and annihilation. The upshot is that in\nquantum physics, a naked space-time singularity need not lead to a breakdown of\nphysical laws, but on the contrary allows for boundary conditions governing\nwhat comes out of the singularity and thereby removing the ultraviolet\ndivergence.",

      "abstract": "Bi-factor analysis is a form of confirmatory factor analysis widely used in\npsychological and educational measurement. The use of a bi-factor model\nrequires the specification of an explicit bi-factor structure on the\nrelationship between the observed variables and the group factors. In practice,\nthe bi-factor structure is sometimes unknown, in which case an exploratory form\nof bi-factor analysis is needed to find the bi-factor structure. Unfortunately,\nthere are few methods for exploratory bi-factor analysis, with the exception of\na rotation-based method proposed in Jennrich and Bentler (2011, 2012). However,\nthis method only finds approximate bi-factor structures, as it does not yield\nan exact bi-factor loading structure, even after applying hard thresholding. In\nthis paper, we propose a constraint-based optimisation method that learns an\nexact bi-factor loading structure from data, overcoming the issue with the\nrotation-based method. The key to the proposed method is a mathematical\ncharacterisation of the bi-factor loading structure as a set of equality\nconstraints, which allows us to formulate the exploratory bi-factor analysis\nproblem as a constrained optimisation problem in a continuous domain and solve\nthe optimisation problem with an augmented Lagrangian method. The power of the\nproposed method is shown via simulation studies and a real data example.\nExtending the proposed method to exploratory hierarchical factor analysis is\nalso discussed.

      "abstract": "Driven-dissipative nonlinear systems exhibit rich critical behavior, related\nto bifurcation, bistability and switching, which underlie key phenomena in\nareas ranging from physics, chemistry and biology to social sciences and\neconomics. The importance of rare fluctuations leading to a dramatic jump\nbetween two very distinct states, such as survival and extinction in population\ndynamics, success and bankruptcy in economics and the occurrence of earthquakes\nor of epileptic seizures, have been already established. In the quantum domain,\nswitching is of importance in both chemical reactions and the devices used in\nquantum state detection and amplification. In particular, the simplest driven\nsingle oscillator model serves as an insightful starting point. Here we\ndescribe switching induced by quantum fluctuations and illustrate that an\ninstanton approach within Keldysh field theory can provide a deep insight into\nsuch phenomena. We provide a practical recipe to compute the switching rates\nsemi-analytically, which agrees remarkably well with exact solutions across a\nwide domain of drive amplitudes spanning many orders of magnitude. Being set up\nin the framework of Keldysh coherent states path integrals, our approach opens\nthe possibility of studying quantum activation in many-body systems where other\napproaches are inapplicable.",

Specifically, given a private dataset and a trained\nneural network, we need to use e.g. pruning, fine-tuning, and gradient ascent\nto remove the influence of the private dataset on the neural network. Inspired\nby this, we try to use this concept to bridge the gap between the fields of\nimage restoration and security, creating a new research idea. We propose the\nscene for the All-In-One model (a neural network that restores a wide range of\ndegraded information), where a given dataset such as haze, or rain, is private\nand needs to be eliminated from the influence of it on the trained model.\nNotably, we find great challenges in this task to remove the influence of\nsensitive data while ensuring that the overall model performance remains\nrobust, which is akin to directing a symphony orchestra without specific\ninstruments while keeping the playing soothing.

      "abstract": "Understanding electrical characteristics and corresponding transport models\nat single molecular junctions is crucial. There have been many reports on\norganic compounds-based single molecular junctions. However, organometallic\ncompounds-based single molecular junctions have not been explored yet. Re(I)\norganometallic compounds are known to exhibit intriguing photophysical\nproperties scrutinized for photocatalysis, and light-emitting diodes but have\nnot been explored in molecular electronics. In this work, a theoretical model\nstudy on the I-V characteristics of two Re(I)-carbonyl complexes bearing Re-P\nand Re-N-N linkage has been meticulously chosen. Tunneling and hopping\ntransport in Au/Re(I)-complex/Au single-molecule junctions are governed by\nLandauer-formalism and the Marcus theory, respectively. Interestingly,\nvariations in molecular architecture culminate in notable variations in\njunction functionality and mechanism of charge conduction. Physical parameters\ninfluencing the device characteristics such as dipole moment,\nmolecule-electrode coupling strength, voltage division factor, and temperature\nhave been extensively studied which offers modulation of the characteristics\nand device design. The dominant hopping current in Re complex bearing\nbipyridine linkage was found to be responsible for the observed asymmetric\nelectrical (I-V) behavior. Our work paves the way for constructing various\norganometallic compounds-based molecular junctions to understand electronic\nfunctions and the underlying transport mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Unsupervised heterogeneous graph representation learning (UHGRL) has gained\nincreasing attention due to its significance in handling practical graphs\nwithout labels. However, heterophily has been largely ignored, despite its\nubiquitous presence in real-world heterogeneous graphs. In this paper, we\ndefine semantic heterophily and propose an innovative framework called Latent\nGraphs Guided Unsupervised Representation Learning (LatGRL) to handle this\nproblem. First, we develop a similarity mining method that couples global\nstructures and attributes, enabling the construction of fine-grained homophilic\nand heterophilic latent graphs to guide the representation learning. Moreover,\nwe propose an adaptive dual-frequency semantic fusion mechanism to address the\nproblem of node-level semantic heterophily. To cope with the massive scale of\nreal-world data, we further design a scalable implementation. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of\nour proposed framework.

      "abstract": "Inadequate bounding box modeling in regression tasks constrains the\nperformance of one-stage 3D object detection. Our study reveals that the\nprimary reason lies in two aspects: (1) The limited center-offset prediction\nseriously impairs the bounding box localization since many highest response\npositions significantly deviate from object centers. (2) The low-quality sample\nignored in regression tasks significantly impacts the bounding box prediction\nsince it produces unreliable quality (IoU) rectification. To tackle these\nproblems, we propose Decoupled and Interactive Regression Modeling (DIRM) for\none-stage detection. Specifically, Decoupled Attribute Regression (DAR) is\nimplemented to facilitate long regression range modeling for the center\nattribute through an adaptive multi-sample assignment strategy that deeply\ndecouples bounding box attributes. On the other hand, to enhance the\nreliability of IoU predictions for low-quality results, Interactive Quality\nPrediction (IQP) integrates the classification task, proficient in modeling\nnegative samples, with quality prediction for joint optimization. Extensive\nexperiments on Waymo and ONCE datasets demonstrate that DIRM significantly\nimproves the performance of several state-of-the-art methods with minimal\nadditional inference latency.

      "abstract": "Topological photonics has revolutionized manipulations of electromagnetic\nwaves by leveraging various topological phases proposed originally in condensed\nmatters, leading to robust and error-immune signal processing. Despite\nconsiderable efforts, a critical challenge remains in devising frequency\nrouters operating at a broadband frequency range with limited crosstalk.\nPrevious designs usually relied on fine tuning of parameters and are difficult\nto be integrated efficiently and compactly. Here, targeting the demand for\nfrequency-selective applications in on-chip photonics, we explore a topological\napproach to photonic frequency router via valley-Hall metacrystals. Diverging\nfrom the majority of studies which focuses on zigzag interfaces, our research\nshifts the attention to armchair interfaces within an ABA sandwich-like\nstructure, where a single column of type-B metacrystal acts as a perturbation\nin the background type-A metacrystal. Essentially, through tuning a single\ngeometric parameter of the type-B metacrystal, this configuration gives rise to\ninterface states within a customized frequency band, enabling signal routing\nwith limited crosstalk to meet specified demands. Moreover, this concept is\npractically demonstrated through a photonic frequency router with three\ndistinct channels, experimentally exhibiting robust wave transmissions with\nexcellent agreement with the design. This investigation manifests possible\napplications of the armchair interfaces in valley-Hall photonic systems and\nadvances development of photonic devices that are both compact and efficient.\nNotably, the approach is naturally compatible with on-chip photonics and\nintegration, which could benefit telecommunications and optical computing\napplications.",

To\naddress these issues, we present a novel FVC method, Identity-Disentanglement\nFace-based Voice Conversion (ID-FaceVC), which overcomes the above two\nlimitations. More precisely, we propose an Identity-Aware Query-based\nContrastive Learning (IAQ-CL) module to extract speaker-specific facial\nfeatures, and a Mutual Information-based Dual Decoupling (MIDD) module to\npurify content features from audio, ensuring clear and high-quality voice\nconversion. Besides, unlike prior works, our method can accept either audio or\ntext inputs, offering controllable speech generation with adjustable emotional\ntone and speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ID-FaceVC achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various metrics, with qualitative and user\nstudy results confirming its effectiveness in naturalness, similarity, and\ndiversity.

      "title": "MARS: Matching Attribute-aware Representations for Text-based Sequential\n  Recommendation",
      "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item a user is likely to\nprefer based on their sequential interaction history. Recently, text-based\nsequential recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm that uses\npre-trained language models to exploit textual item features to enhance\nperformance and facilitate knowledge transfer to unseen datasets. However,\nexisting text-based recommender models still struggle with two key challenges:\n(i) representing users and items with multiple attributes, and (ii) matching\nitems with complex user interests. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel model, Matching Attribute-aware Representations for Text-based Sequential\nRecommendation (MARS). MARS extracts detailed user and item representations\nthrough attribute-aware text encoding, capturing diverse user intents with\nmultiple attribute-aware representations. It then computes user-item scores via\nattribute-wise interaction matching, effectively capturing attribute-level user\npreferences. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MARS significantly\noutperforms existing sequential models, achieving improvements of up to 24.43%\nand 29.26% in Recall@10 and NDCG@10 across five benchmark datasets.

A recent literature has challenged these models, pointing\nout some concerning monotonicity and, thus, identification problems. In this\npaper, we take a second look and point out that some of the criticism - while\nextremely valid - may have gone too far, demanding monotonicity of choice\nprobabilities in decisions where it is not so clear whether it should be\nimposed. We introduce a new class of random utility models based on carefully\nconstructed generalized risk premia which always satisfy our relaxed\nmonotonicity criteria. Moreover, we show that some of the models used in\napplied research like the certainty-equivalent-based random utility model for\nCARA utility actually lie in this class of monotonic stochastic choice models.\nWe conclude that not all random utility models are bad.",

To solve this problem, we focused on\nreciprocal innervation in the human nervous system, and then implemented\nantagonist inhibition control (AIC) based on the reflex.

We explore the scenario\nwhere two $Z_{\\mathcal N}$ QCD axions undergo mass mixing during the QCD phase\ntransition, yielding three distinct mixing scenarios: mixing I, II, and III.\nThese scenarios are realized through fine-tuning of the axion decay constants,\nthe temperature parameters, as well as the value of $\\mathcal N$. We conduct a\nthorough analysis of the level crossing phenomena in these three mixing\nscenarios, detailing the conditions under which they occur. Notably, in the\nmixing I and II, the level crossing precedes the critical temperature of the\nQCD phase transition ($T_{\\rm QCD}$), with minimal non-essential discrepancies\nin the cosmological evolution of the mass eigenvalues at $T_{\\rm QCD}$. In\ncontrast, the mixing III exhibits a unique double level crossings, occurring\nboth before and at $T_{\\rm QCD}$. Despite superficial similarities in axion\nevolution between the mixing II and III, we uncover fundamental differences\nbetween them. Additionally, we briefly address the transition in energy density\nbetween the two axions within our mixing scenarios. This work contributes to a\ndeeper understanding of the role of the QCD axion in the early Universe and its\npotential implications for dark matter.",

      "abstract": "X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in\nartificial intelligence which can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens and\npatient wait times. Despite significant progress, we believe that the task has\nreached a bottleneck due to the limited benchmark datasets and the existing\nlarge models' insufficient capability enhancements in this specialized domain.\nSpecifically, the recently released CheXpert Plus dataset lacks comparative\nevaluation algorithms and their results, providing only the dataset itself.\nThis situation makes the training, evaluation, and comparison of subsequent\nalgorithms challenging. Thus, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking of\nexisting mainstream X-ray report generation models and large language models\n(LLMs), on the CheXpert Plus dataset. We believe that the proposed benchmark\ncan provide a solid comparative basis for subsequent algorithms and serve as a\nguide for researchers to quickly grasp the state-of-the-art models in this\nfield. More importantly, we propose a large model for the X-ray image report\ngeneration using a multi-stage pre-training strategy, including self-supervised\nautoregressive generation and Xray-report contrastive learning, and supervised\nfine-tuning. Extensive experimental results indicate that the autoregressive\npre-training based on Mamba effectively encodes X-ray images, and the\nimage-text contrastive pre-training further aligns the feature spaces,\nachieving better experimental results.

      "abstract": "Image restoration and spectral reconstruction are longstanding computer\nvision tasks. Currently, CNN-transformer hybrid models provide state-of-the-art\nperformance for these tasks. The key common ingredient in the architectural\ndesigns of these models is Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). We first show\nthat CSA is an overall low-rank operation. Then, we propose an instance-Guided\nLow-rank Multi-Head selfattention (GLMHA) to replace the CSA for a considerable\ncomputational gain while closely retaining the original model performance.\nUnique to the proposed GLMHA is its ability to provide computational gain for\nboth short and long input sequences. In particular, the gain is in terms of\nboth Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and parameter count reduction. This is\nin contrast to the existing popular computational complexity reduction\ntechniques, e.g., Linformer, Performer, and Reformer, for whom FLOPs overpower\nthe efficient design tricks for the shorter input sequences. Moreover,\nparameter reduction remains unaccounted for in the existing methods.We perform\nan extensive evaluation for the tasks of spectral reconstruction from RGB\nimages, spectral reconstruction from snapshot compressive imaging, motion\ndeblurring, and image deraining by enhancing the best-performing models with\nour GLMHA. Our results show up to a 7.7 Giga FLOPs reduction with 370K fewer\nparameters required to closely retain the original performance of the\nbest-performing models that employ CSA.",

      "abstract": "Understanding local risks from extreme rainfall, such as flooding, requires\nboth long records (to sample rare events) and high-resolution products (to\nassess localized hazards). Unfortunately, there is a dearth of long-record and\nhigh-resolution products that can be used to understand local risk and\nprecipitation science. In this paper, we present a novel generative diffusion\nmodel that downscales (super-resolves) globally available Climate Prediction\nCenter (CPC) gauge-based precipitation products and ERA5 reanalysis data to\ngenerate kilometer-scale precipitation estimates. Downscaling gauge-based\nprecipitation from 55 km to 1 km while recovering extreme rainfall signals\nposes significant challenges. To enforce our model (named WassDiff) to produce\nwell-calibrated precipitation intensity values, we introduce a Wasserstein\nDistance Regularization (WDR) term for the score-matching training objective in\nthe diffusion denoising process. We show that WDR greatly enhances the model's\nability to capture extreme values compared to diffusion without WDR. Extensive\nevaluation shows that WassDiff has better reconstruction accuracy and bias\nscores than conventional score-based diffusion models. Case studies of extreme\nweather phenomena, like tropical storms and cold fronts, demonstrate WassDiff's\nability to produce appropriate spatial patterns while capturing extremes. Such\ndownscaling capability enables the generation of extensive km-scale\nprecipitation datasets from existing historical global gauge records and\ncurrent gauge measurements in areas without high-resolution radar.",

      "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are applied across diverse domains, the\nability to selectively unlearn specific information has become increasingly\nessential. For instance, LLMs are expected to provide confidential information\nto authorized internal users, such as employees or trusted partners, while\nwithholding it from external users, including the general public and\nunauthorized entities. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel method\ntermed ``in-context knowledge unlearning'', which enables the model to\nselectively forget information in test-time based on the context of the query.\nOur method fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs to enable prompt unlearning of target\nknowledge within the context, while preserving other knowledge. Experiments on\nthe TOFU and AGE datasets using Llama2-7B/13B and Mistral-7B models show our\nmethod achieves up to 95% forgetting accuracy while retaining 80% of unrelated\nknowledge, significantly outperforming baselines in both in-domain and\nout-of-domain scenarios. Further investigation into the model's internal\nbehavior revealed that while fine-tuned LLMs generate correct predictions in\nthe middle layers and maintain them up to the final layer, they make the\ndecision to forget at the last layer, i.e., ``LLMs pretend to forget''. Our\nfindings offer valuable insights into enhancing the robustness of unlearning\nmechanisms in LLMs, setting a foundation for future research in the field.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we analyze the formation of compact, anisotropic stellar\nconfigurations by following the scheme of decoupling the gravitational-field\nsectors within the principles of complete geometric deformation. In pursuit of\nthis aim, we use viable stellar constraints, including density-like constraints\nand the zero-complexity factor scheme proposed in the context of stellar\nconfigurations. We begin with employing an appropriate metric ansatz as the\ninitial metric potential (seed solution). Imposing the zero-complexity factor\nconstraint allows us to fully capture the gravitational behavior of compact\nstellar distribution featuring anisotropic pressure. Then, the process of\ncompletely deforming the gravitational field source leads to the formation of\nthe desired, highly dense stellar configuration. The novelty of our approach is\nin the implementation of zero-complexity and density-like techniques to derive\nthe deformation functions. By solving the resulting governing equations, we\nobtain two solutions, which are consistent with the physical viability tests.\nThese tests show that pressure anisotropy within the confined object greatly\naffects its stability. It is concluded that the direction of energy transfer\nbetween the seed-gravitational field region and the unknown generic-field\ngenerator is described by the deformation parameter.",

      "abstract": "Traffic forecasting is a cornerstone of smart city management, enabling\nefficient resource allocation and transportation planning. Deep learning, with\nits ability to capture complex nonlinear patterns in spatiotemporal (ST) data,\nhas emerged as a powerful tool for traffic forecasting. While graph neural\nnetworks (GCNs) and transformer-based models have shown promise, their\ncomputational demands often hinder their application to real-world road\nnetworks, particularly those with large-scale spatiotemporal interactions. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel spatiotemporal graph transformer\n(STGformer) architecture. STGformer effectively balances the strengths of GCNs\nand Transformers, enabling efficient modeling of both global and local traffic\npatterns while maintaining a manageable computational footprint. Unlike\ntraditional approaches that require multiple attention layers, STG attention\nblock captures high-order spatiotemporal interactions in a single layer,\nsignificantly reducing computational cost. In particular, STGformer achieves a\n100x speedup and a 99.8\\% reduction in GPU memory usage compared to STAEformer\nduring batch inference on a California road graph with 8,600 sensors. We\nevaluate STGformer on the LargeST benchmark and demonstrate its superiority\nover state-of-the-art Transformer-based methods such as PDFormer and\nSTAEformer, which underline STGformer's potential to revolutionize traffic\nforecasting by overcoming the computational and memory limitations of existing\napproaches, making it a promising foundation for future spatiotemporal modeling\ntasks.",

      "abstract": "Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to diagnose and\ntreat joint problems. The clinical workflow of arthroscopy typically involves\ninserting an arthroscope into the joint through a small incision, during which\nsurgeons navigate and operate largely by relying on their visual assessment\nthrough the arthroscope. However, the arthroscope's restricted field of view\nand lack of depth perception pose challenges in navigating complex articular\nstructures and achieving surgical precision during procedures. Aiming at\nenhancing intraoperative awareness, we present a robust pipeline that\nincorporates simultaneous localization and mapping, depth estimation, and 3D\nGaussian splatting to realistically reconstruct intra-articular structures\nsolely based on monocular arthroscope video. Extending 3D reconstruction to\nAugmented Reality (AR) applications, our solution offers AR assistance for\narticular notch measurement and annotation anchoring in a human-in-the-loop\nmanner. Compared to traditional Structure-from-Motion and Neural Radiance\nField-based methods, our pipeline achieves dense 3D reconstruction and\ncompetitive rendering fidelity with explicit 3D representation in 7 minutes on\naverage. When evaluated on four phantom datasets, our method achieves RMSE =\n2.21mm reconstruction error, PSNR = 32.86 and SSIM = 0.89 on average.

      "abstract": "Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) is an emerging method for uncertainty\nestimation that provides reliable predictive uncertainty in a single forward\npass, attracting significant attention. Grounded in subjective logic, EDL\nderives Dirichlet concentration parameters from neural networks to construct a\nDirichlet probability density function (PDF), modeling the distribution of\nclass probabilities. Despite its success, EDL incorporates several nonessential\nsettings: In model construction, (1) a commonly ignored prior weight parameter\nis fixed to the number of classes, while its value actually impacts the balance\nbetween the proportion of evidence and its magnitude in deriving predictive\nscores. In model optimization, (2) the empirical risk features a\nvariance-minimizing optimization term that biases the PDF towards a Dirac delta\nfunction, potentially exacerbating overconfidence. (3) Additionally, the\nstructural risk typically includes a KL-divergence-minimizing regularization,\nwhose optimization direction extends beyond the intended purpose and\ncontradicts common sense, diminishing the information carried by the evidence\nmagnitude. Therefore, we propose Re-EDL, a simplified yet more effective\nvariant of EDL, by relaxing the nonessential settings and retaining the\nessential one, namely, the adoption of projected probability from subjective\nlogic. Specifically, Re-EDL treats the prior weight as an adjustable\nhyperparameter rather than a fixed scalar, and directly optimizes the\nexpectation of the Dirichlet PDF provided by deprecating both the\nvariance-minimizing optimization term and the divergence regularization term.\nExtensive experiments and state-of-the-art performance validate the\neffectiveness of our method.

      "abstract": "Enabling generative models to decompose visual concepts from a single image\nis a complex and challenging problem. In this paper, we study a new and\nchallenging task, customized concept decomposition, wherein the objective is to\nleverage diffusion models to decompose a single image and generate visual\nconcepts from various perspectives. To address this challenge, we propose a\ntwo-stage framework, CusConcept (short for Customized Visual Concept\nDecomposition), to extract customized visual concept embedding vectors that can\nbe embedded into prompts for text-to-image generation. In the first stage,\nCusConcept employs a vocabulary-guided concept decomposition mechanism to build\nvocabularies along human-specified conceptual axes. The decomposed concepts are\nobtained by retrieving corresponding vocabularies and learning anchor weights.\nIn the second stage, joint concept refinement is performed to enhance the\nfidelity and quality of generated images. We further curate an evaluation\nbenchmark for assessing the performance of the open-world concept decomposition\ntask. Our approach can effectively generate high-quality images of the\ndecomposed concepts and produce related lexical predictions as secondary\noutcomes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of CusConcept.",

Traditional\nreconstruction techniques often require many projections, while reconstruction\nfrom sparse-view X-ray projections is a potential way of reducing radiation\ndose.

To this end, we propose 3DGR-CAR, a 3D Gaussian\nRepresentation for Coronary Artery Reconstruction from ultra-sparse X-ray\nprojections.

This study develops a method to\nautomatically count exercise repetitions by analyzing IMU signals, with a focus\non a universal exercise repetition counting task that counts all types of\nexercise movements, including novel exercises not seen during training, using a\nsingle model. Since peak patterns can vary significantly between different\nexercises as well as between individuals performing the same exercise, the\nmodel needs to learn a complex embedding space of sensor data to generalize\neffectively. To address this challenge,we propose a repetition counting\ntechnique utilizing a deep metric-based few-shot learning approach, designed to\nhandle both existing and novel exercises. By redefining the counting task as a\nfew-shot classification problem, the method is capable of detecting peak\nrepetition patterns in exercises not seen during training. The approach employs\na Siamese network with triplet loss, optimizing the embedding space to\ndistinguish between peak and non-peak frames. Evaluation results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing an 86.8% probability of\naccurately counting ten or more repetitions within a single set across 28\ndifferent exercises. This performance highlights the model's ability to\ngeneralize across various exercise types, including those not present in the\ntraining data.

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel\nhuman summarization preference alignment framework AlignSum. This framework\nconsists of three parts: Firstly, we construct a Data Pymarid with extractive,\nabstractive, and human-annotated summary data. Secondly, we conduct the\nGaussian Resampling to remove summaries with extreme lengths. Finally, we\nimplement the two-stage hierarchical fine-tuning with Data Pymarid after\nGaussian Resampling. We apply AlignSum to PLMs on the human-annotated\nCNN/DailyMail and BBC XSum datasets.

In this paper, we introduce a Transferable\nProto-Learning Network (TPN) to address the challenging issue.

As a plug-and-play module for Out-of-Domain (OOD) Detection,\nTransferable Proto-Learner computes NOTA prototype through an adaptive\nlearnable block, effectively mitigating NOTA bias across various domains.\nDynamic Weighting Calibrator detects relation-specific classification\nconfidence, serving as dynamic weights to calibrate the NOTA-dominant loss\nfunction. Finally, to bolster the model's cross-domain performance, we\ncomplement it with virtual adversarial training (VAT). We conduct extensive\nexperimental analyses on FREDo and ReFREDo, demonstrating the superiority of\nTPN.

      "abstract": "Buckminsterfullerene, C$_{60}$, has not only a beautiful truncated\nicosahedral (soccerball) shape, but simple H\\\"uckel calculations predict a\nthree-fold degenerate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) which can\naccomodate up to six electrons making it a good electron acceptor. Experiments\nhave confirmed that C60 is a radical sponge and it is now sold for use in\ntopical cosmetics. Further medical uses require functionalization of C60 to\nmake it soluble and one of the simplest functionalization is to make C60(OH)n\nfullerenols. A previous article [Adv. Quant. Chem. 8, 351 (2023)] studied\nreactivity indices for the successive addition of the $^\\bullet$OH radical to\n($^\\bullet$)C$_{60}$(OH)$_n$ in gas phase. [($^\\bullet$)C$_{60}$(OH)$_n$ is\nonly a radical when n is an odd number.] This present article extends this\nprevious work by examining various aspects of how the reaction, changes in\naqueous solution. One obvious difference between C$_{60}$ and their various\nisomers of C$_{60}$(OH)$_2$ is the presence of a dipole. As fullerendiols are\nnearly spherical, their change in dipole moment in going from gas to aqueous\nphase may be estimated using back-of-the-envellope calculations with the\nOnsager model. The result is remarkably similar to what is obtained using\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) and the more sophisticated solvation model\nbased upon the quantum mechanical density (SMD). Calculation of fullerendiol\nC-O bond energies and reactivity indices using with the SMD approach confirm\nthat the general conclusions from the earlier work regarding gas-phase\nreactivity still hold in the aqueous phase.",

      "abstract": "Semantic parsers convert natural language to logical forms, which can be\nevaluated on knowledge bases (KBs) to produce denotations. Recent semantic\nparsers have been developed with sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs) or large language models, where the models treat logical\nforms as sequences of tokens. For syntactic and semantic validity, the semantic\nparsers use grammars that enable constrained decoding. However, the grammars\nlack the ability to utilize large information of KBs, although logical forms\ncontain representations of KB elements, such as entities or relations. In this\nwork, we propose a grammar augmented with candidate expressions for semantic\nparsing on a large KB with a seq2seq PLM. The grammar defines actions as\nproduction rules, and our semantic parser predicts actions during inference\nunder the constraints by types and candidate expressions. We apply the grammar\nto knowledge base question answering, where the constraints by candidate\nexpressions assist a semantic parser to generate valid KB elements. In\nexperiments on two benchmarks, KQA Pro and Overnight, the constraints by\ncandidate expressions increased the accuracy of our semantic parser, whether it\nwas trained with strong supervision or weak supervision. Our semantic parser\nachieved state-of-the-art accuracies on KQA Pro and Overnight, and its\nimplementation is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/daehwannam/candexpr-sp.git.",

To achieve this goal, current\nmethods typically attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to\noptimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual\nquality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned\nspecifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a\nconstraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the\nreconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent\ntheoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally\ntransporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution\nof the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce\nPosterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm\nthat approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts\nthe posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image\nusing a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport\nmap. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it\nconsistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration\ntasks.",

By\nleveraging the flexibility of KANs, KANOP provides a learnable alternative to\nthe conventional set of basis functions used in the LSMC model, allowing the\nmodel to adapt to the pricing task and effectively estimate the expected\ncontinuation value. Using examples of standard American and Asian-American\noptions, we demonstrate that KANOP produces more reliable option value\nestimates, both for single-dimensional cases and in more complex scenarios\ninvolving multiple input variables. The delta estimated by the KANOP model is\nalso more accurate than that obtained using conventional basis functions, which\nis crucial for effective option hedging.

The\ntraining outcomes for elliptical cylinders with a blockage ratio of 0.24 show\nthat for Ar=1 and 0.75, the reward function gradually increases with decreasing\noscillations before stabilizing. The agent's control strategy achieved drag\nreduction rates of 8% and 15%, while 99% of the lift coefficient is effectively\nsuppressed. It deserves emphasis that vortex shedding is entirely eliminated\nwith only 0.1% and 1% of the inlet flow rate. As Ar decreases, the\nreinforcement learning process slows and becomes less stable, with energy\nconsumption surging to 14.5%, while lift and drag coefficients continue\noscillating and vortex shedding remains uncontrolled. When blockage ratio is\nreduced to 0.12, the reinforcement learning training demonstrates robust\nconvergence and consistent full suppression of vortex shedding across all Ar\nfrom 1 to 0.1. Furthermore, drag reduction rates are observed within the range\nof 6.1% to 32.3%, while the lift coefficient is effectively regulated to remain\nat zero. For cylinders with Ar between 1 and 0.25, external energy expenditure\nremains below 1.4% of the inlet flow rate, signifying the realization of both\nefficient and energy-conservative control strategies within this range.\nHowever, for the extremely slender elliptical cylinder with Ar=0.1, the energy\ncost escalates to 8.1%, underscoring the significantly higher energy\nexpenditure required to fulfill the control objectives for such highly\nelongated geometries.",

We refer to this as question awareness of LLMs. The lack of\nquestion awareness in LLMs leads to two phenomena that LLMs are: (1) too casual\nto answer non-open-ended questions or (2) too boring to answer open-ended\nquestions. In this paper, we first evaluate the question awareness in LLMs. The\nexperimental results show that LLMs have the issues of lacking awareness of\nquestions in certain domains, e.g. factual knowledge, resulting in\nhallucinations during the generation. To mitigate these, we propose a method\ncalled Question Awareness Temperature Sampling (QuATS). This method enhances\nthe question awareness of LLMs by adaptively adjusting the output distributions\nbased on question features. The automatic adjustment in QuATS eliminates the\nneed for manual temperature tuning in text generation and consistently improves\nmodel performance in various benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Simulation has enabled unprecedented compute-scalable approaches to robot\nlearning. However, many existing simulation frameworks typically support a\nnarrow range of scenes/tasks and lack features critical for scaling\ngeneralizable robotics and sim2real. We introduce and open source ManiSkill3,\nthe fastest state-visual GPU parallelized robotics simulator with contact-rich\nphysics targeting generalizable manipulation. ManiSkill3 supports GPU\nparallelization of many aspects including simulation+rendering, heterogeneous\nsimulation, pointclouds/voxels visual input, and more. Simulation with\nrendering on ManiSkill3 can run 10-1000x faster with 2-3x less GPU memory usage\nthan other platforms, achieving up to 30,000+ FPS in benchmarked environments\ndue to minimal python/pytorch overhead in the system, simulation on the GPU,\nand the use of the SAPIEN parallel rendering system. Tasks that used to take\nhours to train can now take minutes. We further provide the most comprehensive\nrange of GPU parallelized environments/tasks spanning 12 distinct domains\nincluding but not limited to mobile manipulation for tasks such as drawing,\nhumanoids, and dextrous manipulation in realistic scenes designed by artists or\nreal-world digital twins. In addition, millions of demonstration frames are\nprovided from motion planning, RL, and teleoperation. ManiSkill3 also provides\na comprehensive set of baselines that span popular RL and\nlearning-from-demonstrations algorithms.",

      "abstract": "The expanding context windows in large language models (LLMs) have greatly\nenhanced their capabilities in various applications, but they also introduce\nsignificant challenges in maintaining low latency, particularly in Time to\nFirst Token (TTFT). This paper identifies that the sharp rise in TTFT as\ncontext length increases is predominantly driven by queuing delays, which are\ncaused by the growing demands for GPU Key-Value (KV) cache allocation clashing\nwith the limited availability of KV cache blocks. To address this issue, we\npropose LayerKV, a simple yet effective plug-in method that effectively reduces\nTTFT without requiring additional hardware or compromising output performance,\nwhile seamlessly integrating with existing parallelism strategies and\nscheduling techniques. Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block\nallocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system\nmemory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level\nObjectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging\nfrom 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that\nLayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 69x and reduces SLO violation rates by\n28.7%, significantly enhancing the user experience.",

      "abstract": "AI foundation models have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities\nacross a wide range of tasks. Fine-tuning (FT) is a method of customizing a\npre-trained AI foundation model by further training it on a smaller, targeted\ndataset. In this paper, we initiate the study of the Privacy-Preserving\nParameter-Efficient FT (P3EFT) framework, which can be viewed as the\nintersection of Parameter-Efficient FT (PEFT) and Privacy-Preserving FT (PPFT).\nPEFT modifies only a small subset of the model's parameters to achieve FT\n(i.e., adapting a pre-trained model to a specific dataset), while PPFT uses\nprivacy-preserving technologies to protect the confidentiality of the model\nduring the FT process. There have been many studies on PEFT or PPFT but very\nfew on their fusion, which motivates our work on P3EFT to achieve both\nparameter efficiency and model privacy. To exemplify our P3EFT, we present the\nPrivTuner scheme, which incorporates Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enabled\nprivacy protection into LoRA (short for ``Low-Rank Adapter''). Intuitively\nspeaking, PrivTuner allows the model owner and the external data owners to\ncollaboratively implement PEFT with encrypted data. After describing PrivTuner\nin detail, we further investigate its energy consumption and privacy\nprotection. Then, we consider a PrivTuner system over wireless communications\nand formulate a joint optimization problem to adaptively minimize energy while\nmaximizing privacy protection, with the optimization variables including FDMA\nbandwidth allocation, wireless transmission power, computational resource\nallocation, and privacy protection. A resource allocation algorithm is devised\nto solve the problem. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can\nsignificantly reduce energy consumption while adapting to different privacy\nrequirements.",

Conventional approaches,\nincluding multimodal large language models (MLLMs), often fail to appropriately\nunderstand detailed characteristics of objects and/or subtle changes in the\nposition of objects. We propose Contrastive $\\lambda$-Repformer, which predicts\ntask success for table-top manipulation tasks by aligning images with\ninstruction sentences. Our method integrates the following three key types of\nfeatures into a multi-level aligned representation: features that preserve\nlocal image information; features aligned with natural language; and features\nstructured through natural language. This allows the model to focus on\nimportant changes by looking at the differences in the representation between\ntwo images.

      "abstract": "We consider a two-dimensional sharp-interface model for solid-state dewetting\nof thin films with anisotropic surface energies on curved substrates, where the\nfilm/vapor interface and substrate surface are represented by an evolving and a\nstatic curve, respectively. The model is governed by the anisotropic surface\ndiffusion for the evolving curve, with appropriate boundary conditions at the\ncontact points where the two curves meet. The continuum model obeys an energy\ndecay law and preserves the enclosed area between the two curves. We introduce\nan arclength parameterization for the substrate curve, which plays a crucial\nrole in a structure-preserving approximation as it straightens the curved\nsubstrate and tracks length changes between contact points. Based on this\ninsight, we introduce a symmetrized weak formulation which leads to an\nunconditional energy stable parametric approximation in terms of the discrete\nenergy. We also provide an error estimate of the enclosed area, which depends\non the substrate profile and can be zero in the case of a flat substrate.\nFurthermore, we introduce a correction to the discrete normals to enable an\nexact area preservation for general curved substrates. The resulting nonlinear\nsystem is efficiently solved using a hybrid iterative algorithm which combines\nboth Picard and Newton's methods. Numerical results are presented to show the\nrobustness and good properties of the introduced method for simulating\nsolid-state dewetting on various curved substrates.",

      "abstract": "The spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), an inherently random\nquantum process, produces a non-deterministic photon-pair with strong temporal\nand spatial correlations owing to both energy and momentum conservation.\nTherefore, the SPDC-based photon pairs are used for quantum random number\ngeneration (QRNG). Typically, temporal correlation in association with an ideal\nunbiased beam splitter is used for QRNG without fully exploring the spatial\ncorrection. As a result, SPDC-based QRNG has a low bit rate. On the other hand,\ndue to the spatial correlation, the photon pairs in non-collinear phase-matched\ngeometry are generated randomly in diametrically opposite points over an\nannular ring spatial distribution. Therefore, exploring the temporal\ncorrelation between photon pairs from different sections of the annual ring can\nlead to multi-bit QRNG at a high rate, avoiding the need for a beam splitter.\nAs a proof-of-concept, we report on high-bit-rate QRNG by using spatial\ncorrelation of photon-pairs by sectioning the SPDC ring of a non-collinear,\ndegenerate, high-brightness source and temporal correlation between the\ndiametrically opposite sections. Dividing the annular ring of the\nhigh-brightness photon-pair source based on a 20 mm long, type-0 phase-matched,\nperiodically-poled KTP crystal into four sections, recording the timestamp of\nthe coincidences (widow of 1 ns) between photons from diametrically opposite\nsections and assigning bits (0 and 1), we extracted 90 million raw bits over\n27.7 s at a pump power of 17 mW. We determined the extraction ratio using the\nminimum entropy evaluation of more than 95% in our case. Using Toeplitz\nmatrix-based post-processing, we achieved a QRNG with a bit-rate of 3 Mbps,\npassing all NIST 800-22 and TestU01 test suites. The generic scheme shows the\npossibility of further enhancement of the bit rate through more sectioning of\nthe SPDC ring.",

      "abstract": "There has been exciting progress in generating images from natural language\nor layout conditions. However, these methods struggle to faithfully reproduce\ncomplex scenes due to the insufficient modeling of multiple objects and their\nrelationships. To address this issue, we leverage the scene graph, a powerful\nstructured representation, for complex image generation. Different from the\nprevious works that directly use scene graphs for generation, we employ the\ngenerative capabilities of variational autoencoders and diffusion models in a\ngeneralizable manner, compositing diverse disentangled visual clues from scene\ngraphs. Specifically, we first propose a Semantics-Layout Variational\nAutoEncoder (SL-VAE) to jointly derive (layouts, semantics) from the input\nscene graph, which allows a more diverse and reasonable generation in a\none-to-many mapping. We then develop a Compositional Masked Attention (CMA)\nintegrated with a diffusion model, incorporating (layouts, semantics) with\nfine-grained attributes as generation guidance. To further achieve graph\nmanipulation while keeping the visual content consistent, we introduce a\nMulti-Layered Sampler (MLS) for an \"isolated\" image editing effect. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method outperforms recent competitors based on\ntext, layout, or scene graph, in terms of generation rationality and\ncontrollability.",

In this paper, we\ninvestigate cosmic Ly$\\alpha$ emission by post-processing cosmological\nsimulations from \\texttt{IllustrisTNG} and \\texttt{THESAN} project.\nSpecifically, we calculate the Ly$\\alpha$ emission from galaxies,\ncircum-galactic medium (CGM) and inter-galactic medium (IGM) across various\nredshifts. Our results show that IGM alone is significantly under the current\nobservational upper limits. Meanwhile, CGM overshoots the observed galaxy\ncontribution at $z \\lesssim 0.5$ indicating that either the escape fraction for\nthe inner CGM is less than unity or the current photoionization equilibrium\ntreatment with an approximate self-shielding prescription is less accurate. The\ngalaxy component also overshoots at low redshift, indicating that the escape\nfraction has strong evolution caused by an evolving halo mass function and dust\ngrowth distribution, that agrees with observationally inferred escape\nfractions. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the Ly$\\alpha$ emission from\ndiffuse gas (CGM+IGM) peaked at $z \\sim 4$ and diminishes toward lower\nredshift. The Ly$\\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas mainly originates through\nthe collisional excitation of hot plasma. By comparing models with observation,\nour predicted Ly$\\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas remains $\\sim 6$ times\nfainter than the observed cosmic Ly$\\alpha$ emission at $z=1-3$. However,\nfuture large telescopes may hold great promise to detect Ly$\\alpha$ emission\nfrom diffuse gas toward $z>3$.",

      "title": "A Scheduling-Aware Defense Against Prefetching-Based Side-Channel\n  Attacks",
      "abstract": "Modern computer processors use microarchitectural optimization mechanisms to\nimprove performance. As a downside, such optimizations are prone to introducing\nside-channel vulnerabilities. Speculative loading of memory, called\nprefetching, is common in real-world CPUs and may cause such side-channel\nvulnerabilities: Prior work has shown that it can be exploited to bypass\nprocess isolation and leak secrets, such as keys used in RSA, AES, and ECDH\nimplementations. However, to this date, no effective and efficient\ncountermeasure has been presented that secures software on systems with\naffected prefetchers.\n  In this work, we answer the question: How can a process defend against\nprefetch-based side channels? We first systematize prefetching-based\nside-channel vulnerabilities presented in academic literature so far. Next, we\ndesign and implement PreFence, a scheduling-aware defense against these side\nchannels that allows processes to disable the prefetcher temporarily during\nsecurity-critical operations. We implement our countermeasure for an x86_64 and\nan ARM processor; it can be adapted to any platform that allows to disable the\nprefetcher. We evaluate our defense and find that our solution reliably stops\nprefetch leakage. Our countermeasure causes negligible performance impact while\nno security-relevant code is executed, and its worst case performance is\ncomparable to completely turning off the prefetcher. The expected average\nperformance impact depends on the security-relevant code in the application and\ncan be negligible as we demonstrate with a simple web server application.\n  We expect our countermeasure could widely be integrated in commodity OS, and\neven be extended to signal generally security-relevant code to the kernel to\nallow coordinated application of countermeasures.",

      "title": "Fine-Grained Vectorized Merge Sorting on RISC-V: From Register to Cache",
      "abstract": "Merge sort as a divide-sort-merge paradigm has been widely applied in\ncomputer science fields. As modern reduced instruction set computing\narchitectures like the fifth generation (RISC-V) regard multiple registers as a\nvector register group for wide instruction parallelism, optimizing merge sort\nwith this vectorized property is becoming increasingly common. In this paper,\nwe overhaul the divide-sort-merge paradigm, from its register-level sort to the\ncache-aware merge, to develop a fine-grained RISC-V vectorized merge sort\n(RVMS). From the register-level view, the inline vectorized transpose\ninstruction is missed in RISC-V, so implementing it efficiently is non-trivial.\nBesides, the vectorized comparisons do not always work well in the merging\nnetworks. Both issues primarily stem from the expensive data shuffle\ninstruction. To bypass it, RVMS strides to take register data as the proxy of\ndata shuffle to accelerate the transpose operation, and meanwhile replaces\nvectorized comparisons with scalar cousin for more light real value swap. On\nthe other hand, as cache-aware merge makes larger data merge in the cache, most\nmerge schemes have two drawbacks: the in-cache merge usually has low cache\nutilization, while the out-of-cache merging network remains an ineffectively\nsymmetric structure. To this end, we propose the half-merge scheme to employ\nthe auxiliary space of in-place merge to halve the footprint of naive merge\nsort, and meanwhile copy one sequence to this space to avoid the former data\nexchange. Furthermore, an asymmetric merging network is developed to adapt to\ntwo different input sizes.",

The\nagents contributing to the opinion formation are characterised as being\ninfluential. Initially, the agents are classified as opinion leaders and\nfollowers based on network connectivity and the nature of interactions.\nHowever, the addition of stubbornness leads to interesting behaviours wherein a\nnon influential agent can now become influential and vice versa. Thereafter, a\nsignal flow graph (SFG) based method is proposed to quantify the influence of\nan influential agents' opinions. Additionally, it helps illustrate the role\nplayed by network topology in shaping the final opinions of the agents. Based\non this analysis, the absolute centrality measure is proposed to determine the\noverall influence of all the agents in the network. Unlike most of the existing\nmeasures, it is applicable to any network structure and considers the effect of\nstubbornness and antagonism.

The question analysed here is to link this measurement to the\ninitial size distribution. To do so, we first derive, from the initial reaction\nsystem $$\\mathcal{C}_i \\stackrel{b}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathcal{C}_{i-1} +\n\\mathcal{C}_1,\\qquad i\\geq i_0\\geq 2,$$ two asymptotic models: at first order,\na backward transport equation, and at second order, an\nadvection-diffusion/Fokker-Planck equation complemented with a mixed boundary\ncondition at $x = 0$. We estimate their distance to the original system\nsolution. We then turn to the inverse problem, i.e., how to estimate the\ninitial size distribution from the time measurement of an average quantity,\ngiven by a moment of the solution. This question has been already studied for\nthe first order asymptotic model, and we analyse here the second order\nasymptotic. Thanks to Carleman inequalities and to log-convexity estimates, we\nprove observability results and error estimates for a Tikhonov regularization.\nWe then develop a Kalman-based observer approach, and implement it on simulated\nobservations.

      "abstract": "The hip joint moment during walking is a crucial basis for hip exoskeleton\ncontrol. Compared to generating assistive torque profiles based on gait\nestimation, estimating hip joint moment directly using hip joint angles offers\nadvantages such as simplified sensing and adaptability to variable walking\nspeeds. Existing methods that directly estimate moment from hip joint angles\nare mainly used for offline biomechanical estimation. However, they suffer from\nlong computation time and lack of personalization, rendering them unsuitable\nfor personalized control of hip exoskeletons. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a fast hip joint moment estimation method based on generalized\nmoment features (GMF). The method first employs a GMF generator to learn a\nfeature representation of joint moment, namely the proposed GMF, which is\nindependent of individual differences. Subsequently, a GRU-based neural network\nwith fast computational performance is trained to learn the mapping from the\njoint kinematics to the GMF. Finally, the predicted GMF is decoded into the\njoint moment with a GMF decoder. The joint estimation model is trained and\ntested on a dataset comprising 20 subjects under 28 walking speed conditions.\nResults show that the proposed method achieves a root mean square error of\n0.1180 $\\pm$ 0.0021 Nm/kg for subjects in test dataset, and the computation\ntime per estimation using the employed GRU-based estimator is 1.3420 $\\pm$\n0.0031 ms, significantly faster than mainstream neural network architectures,\nwhile maintaining comparable network accuracy. These promising results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method enhances the accuracy and computational\nspeed of joint moment estimation neural networks, with potential for guiding\nexoskeleton control.",

      "abstract": "Current co-speech motion generation approaches usually focus on upper body\ngestures following speech contents only, while lacking supporting the elaborate\ncontrol of synergistic full-body motion based on text prompts, such as talking\nwhile walking. The major challenges lie in 1) the existing speech-to-motion\ndatasets only involve highly limited full-body motions, making a wide range of\ncommon human activities out of training distribution; 2) these datasets also\nlack annotated user prompts. To address these challenges, we propose SynTalker,\nwhich utilizes the off-the-shelf text-to-motion dataset as an auxiliary for\nsupplementing the missing full-body motion and prompts. The core technical\ncontributions are two-fold. One is the multi-stage training process which\nobtains an aligned embedding space of motion, speech, and prompts despite the\nsignificant distributional mismatch in motion between speech-to-motion and\ntext-to-motion datasets. Another is the diffusion-based conditional inference\nprocess, which utilizes the separate-then-combine strategy to realize\nfine-grained control of local body parts. Extensive experiments are conducted\nto verify that our approach supports precise and flexible control of\nsynergistic full-body motion generation based on both speeches and user\nprompts, which is beyond the ability of existing approaches.",

      "abstract": "In formal verification, runtime monitoring consists of observing the\nexecution of a system in order to decide as quickly as possible whether or not\nit satisfies a given property. We consider monitoring in a distributed setting,\nfor properties given as reachability timed automata. In such a setting, the\nsystem is made of several components, each equipped with its own local clock\nand monitor. The monitors observe events occurring on their associated\ncomponent, and receive timestamped events from other monitors through FIFO\nchannels. Since clocks are local, they cannot be perfectly synchronized,\nresulting in imprecise timestamps. Consequently, they must be seen as\nintervals, leading monitors to consider possible reorderings of events. In this\ncontext, each monitor aims to provide, as early as possible, a verdict on the\nproperty it is monitoring, based on its potentially incomplete and imprecise\nknowledge of the current execution. In this paper, we propose an on-line\nmonitoring algorithm for timed properties, robust to time imprecision and\npartial information from distant components. We first identify the date at\nwhich a monitor can safely compute a verdict based on received events. We then\npropose a monitoring algorithm that updates this date when new information\narrives, maintains the current set of states in which the property can reside,\nand updates its verdict accordingly.",

      "title": "Deep Multimodal Fusion for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Earth\n  Observation Data",
      "abstract": "Accurate semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is critical for\nvarious Earth observation applications, such as land cover mapping, urban\nplanning, and environmental monitoring. However, individual data sources often\npresent limitations for this task. Very High Resolution (VHR) aerial imagery\nprovides rich spatial details but cannot capture temporal information about\nland cover changes. Conversely, Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) capture\ntemporal dynamics, such as seasonal variations in vegetation, but with limited\nspatial resolution, making it difficult to distinguish fine-scale objects. This\npaper proposes a late fusion deep learning model (LF-DLM) for semantic\nsegmentation that leverages the complementary strengths of both VHR aerial\nimagery and SITS. The proposed model consists of two independent deep learning\nbranches. One branch integrates detailed textures from aerial imagery captured\nby UNetFormer with a Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) backbone. The other\nbranch captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics from the Sentinel-2 satellite\nimage time series using a U-Net with Temporal Attention Encoder (U-TAE). This\napproach leads to state-of-the-art results on the FLAIR dataset, a large-scale\nbenchmark for land cover segmentation using multi-source optical imagery. The\nfindings highlight the importance of multi-modality fusion in improving the\naccuracy and robustness of semantic segmentation in remote sensing\napplications.",

      "abstract": "Synchrotron polarization of relativistic nonthermal electrons in gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) has been widely studied. However, recent numerical simulations of\nrelativistic shocks and magnetic reconnection have found that a more realistic\nelectron distribution consists of a power-law component plus a thermal\ncomponent, which requires observational validation. In this paper, we\ninvestigate synchrotron polarization using a hybrid energy distribution of\nrelativistic thermal and nonthermal electrons within a globally toroidal\nmagnetic field in GRB prompt emission. Our results show that, compared to the\ncase of solely non-thermal electrons, the synchrotron polarization degrees\n(PDs) in these hybrid electrons can vary widely depending on different\nparameters and that the PD decreases progressively with frequency in the\n$\\gamma$-ray, X-ray, and optical bands. The time-averaged PD spectrum displays\na significant bump in the $\\gamma$-ray and X-ray bands with the PDs higher than\n$\\sim60\\%$ if the thermal peak energy of electrons is much smaller than the\nconjunctive energy of electrons between the thermal and non-thermal\ndistribution. The high synchrotron PD ($\\gtrsim 60\\%$) in the $\\gamma$-ray and\nX-ray bands, which generally can not be produced by solely non-thermal\nelectrons with typical power-law slopes, can be achieved by the hybrid\nelectrons and primarily originates from the exponential decay part of the\nthermal component. Moreover, this model can roughly explain the PDs and\nspectral properties of some GRBs, where GRB 110301A with a high PD\n($70_{-22}^{+22} \\%$) may be potential evidence for the existence of\nrelativistic thermal electrons.",

Pulse durations as short as a few picoseconds\nhave been used to switch the magnetization of ferromagnetic films, reaching the\nTHz regime. However, little is known about the reversal mechanisms and energy\nrequirements in the ultrafast switching regime. In this work, we quantify the\nenergy cost for magnetization reversal over 7 orders of magnitude in pulse\nduration, in both ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic samples, bridging\nquasi-static spintronics and femtomagnetism. To this end, we develop a method\nto stretch picosecond pulses generated by a photoconductive switch by an order\nof magnitude. Thereby, we can create current pulses from picoseconds to\ndurations approaching pulse width available with commercial instruments. We\nshow that the energy cost for SOT switching decreases by more than an order of\nmagnitude in all samples when the pulse duration enters the picosecond range.\nWe project an energy cost of 9 fJ for a 100 x 100 nm 2 ferrimagnetic device.\nMicromagnetic and macrospin simulations unveil a transition from a non-coherent\nto a coherent magnetization reversal with a strong modification of the\nmagnetization dynamical trajectories as pulse duration is reduced.

To simplify, rather than conducting\nreal-world experiments to assess design quality, we utilize a simulation tool\nto provide feedback to the generative model, allowing for iterative\nimprovements without requiring extensive human annotations. Furthermore, we\nintroduce five evaluation metrics to assess the quality of robot designs from\nmultiple angles including task completion and adherence to instructions,\nsupporting an automatic evaluation process. Our model performs well in\nevaluations for designing soft modular robots with uni- and bi-directional\nlocomotion and stair-descending capabilities, highlighting the potential of\nusing natural language and LLMs for robot design.

      "abstract": "The broad sense genetic heritability, which quantifies the total proportion\nof phenotypic variation in a population due to genetic factors, is crucial for\nunderstanding trait inheritance. While many existing methods focus on\nestimating narrow sense heritability, which accounts only for additive genetic\nvariation, this paper introduces a kernel ridge regression approach to estimate\nbroad-sense heritability. We provide both upper and lower bounds for the\nestimator. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated through\nextensive simulations of both synthetic data and real data from the 1000\nGenomes Project. Additionally, the estimator was applied to data from the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to demonstrate its practical\nutility.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the first steps toward a soft dolphin robot using a\nbio-inspired approach to mimic dolphin flexibility. The current dolphin robot\nuses a minimalist approach, with only two actuated cable-driven degrees of\nfreedom actuated by a pair of motors. The actuated tail moves up and down in a\nswimming motion, but this first proof of concept does not permit controlled\nturns of the robot. While existing robotic dolphins typically use revolute\njoints to articulate rigid bodies, our design -- which will be made opensource\n-- incorporates a flexible tail with tunable silicone skin and actuation\nflexibility via a cable-driven system, which mimics muscle dynamics and design\nflexibility with a tunable skeleton structure. The design is also tunable since\nthe backbone can be easily printed in various geometries. The paper provides\ninsights into how a few such variations affect robot motion and efficiency,\nmeasured by speed and cost of transport (COT). This approach demonstrates the\npotential of achieving dolphin-like motion through enhanced flexibility in\nbio-inspired robotics.",

      "title": "Examining Attacks on Consensus and Incentive Systems in Proof-of-Work\n  Blockchains: A Systematic Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity due to their transparency, security,\nand accessibility compared to traditional financial systems, with Bitcoin,\nintroduced in 2009, leading the market. Bitcoin's security relies on blockchain\ntechnology - a decentralized ledger consisting of a consensus and an incentive\nmechanism. The consensus mechanism, Proof of Work (PoW), requires miners to\nsolve difficult cryptographic puzzles to add new blocks, while the incentive\nmechanism rewards them with newly minted bitcoins. However, as Bitcoin's\nacceptance grows, it faces increasing threats from attacks targeting these\nmechanisms, such as selfish mining, double-spending, and block withholding.\nThese attacks compromise security, efficiency, and reward distribution. Recent\nresearch shows that these attacks can be combined with each other or with\neither malicious strategies, such as network-layer attacks, or non-malicious\nstrategies, like honest mining. These combinations lead to more sophisticated\nattacks, increasing the attacker's success rates and profitability. Therefore,\nunderstanding and evaluating these attacks is essential for developing\neffective countermeasures and ensuring long-term security. This paper begins by\nexamining individual attacks executed in isolation and their profitability. It\nthen explores how combining these attacks with each other or with other\nmalicious and non-malicious strategies can enhance their overall effectiveness\nand profitability. The analysis further explores how the deployment of attacks\nsuch as selfish mining and block withholding by multiple competing mining pools\nagainst each other impacts their economic returns. Lastly, a set of design\nguidelines is provided, outlining areas future work should focus on to prevent\nor mitigate the identified threats.",

This\nobservation was performed in 2024 August. Along with IXPE, we also conducted\nsimultaneous observations with NICER, AstroSat, Insight-HXMT, ATCA, and GMRT to\ninvestigate the broadband spectral and timing properties in the X-ray and radio\nwavelengths. During the campaign, the source traced a complete Z-track during\nthe IXPE observation but spent most of the time in the NB. We measure X-ray\npolarization degree (PD) of $1.22\\pm0.25\\%$ in the 2-8 keV energy band with a\npolarization angle (PA) of $38\\pm6^\\circ$. The PD in the NB is observed to be\nweaker than in the horizontal branch (HB) but aligned in the same direction.\nThe PD of the source exhibits a marginal increase with energy while the PA\nshows no energy dependence. The joint spectro-polarimetric modeling is\nconsistent with the observed X-ray polarization originating from a single\nspectral component from the blackbody, the Comptonized emission, or reflection\nfeature, while the disk emission does not contribute towards the X-ray\npolarization. GMRT observations at 1.26 GHz during HB had a tentative detection\nat 4.5$\\pm$0.7 mJy while ATCA observations a day later during the NB detected\nthe source at 0.70$\\pm$0.05 mJy and 0.59$\\pm$0.05 mJy in the 5.5 & 9 GHz bands,\nrespectively, suggesting an evolving jet structure depending on the Z-track\nposition.",

      "abstract": "Reminiscence, the act of revisiting past memories, is crucial for\nself-reflection and social interaction, significantly enhancing psychological\nwell-being, life satisfaction, and self-identity among older adults. In HCI and\nCSCW, there is growing interest in leveraging technology to support\nreminiscence for older adults. However, understanding how older adults actively\nuse technologies for realistic and practical reminiscence in their daily lives\nremains limited. This paper addresses this gap by providing an in-depth,\nempirical understanding of technology-mediated, photo-based reminiscence among\nolder adults. Through a two-part study involving 20 older adults, we conducted\nsemi-structured interviews and co-design sessions to explore their use and\nvision of digital technologies for photo-based reminiscence activities. Based\non these insights, we propose design implications to make future reminiscence\ntechnologies more accessible and empowering for older adults.",

      "abstract": "A Blockchain Name System (BNS) simplifies the process of sending\ncryptocurrencies by replacing complex cryptographic recipient addresses with\nhuman-readable names, making the transactions more convenient. Unfortunately,\nthese names can be susceptible to typosquatting attacks, where attackers can\ntake advantage of user typos by registering typographically similar BNS names.\nUnsuspecting users may accidentally mistype or misinterpret the intended name,\nresulting in an irreversible transfer of funds to an attacker's address instead\nof the intended recipient. In this work, we present the first large-scale,\nintra-BNS typosquatting study. To understand the prevalence of typosquatting\nwithin BNSs, we study three different services (Ethereum Name Service,\nUnstoppable Domains, and ADAHandles) spanning three blockchains (Ethereum,\nPolygon, and Cardano), collecting a total of 4.9M BNS names and 200M\ntransactions-the largest dataset for BNSs to date. We describe the challenges\ninvolved in conducting name-squatting studies on these alternative naming\nsystems, and then perform an in-depth quantitative analysis of our dataset. We\nfind that typosquatters are indeed active on BNSs, registering more malicious\ndomains with each passing year. Our analysis reveals that users have sent\nthousands of transactions to squatters and that squatters target both globally\npopular BNS domain names as well as the domains owned by popular Twitter/X\nusers. Lastly, we document the complete lack of defenses against typosquatting\nin custodial and non-custodial wallets and propose straightforward\ncountermeasures that can protect users without relying on third-party services.",

Existing scene text removal models require complex annotation and\nretraining, and may leave faint yet recognizable text information, compromising\nprivacy protection and content concealment. TextDestroyer addresses these\nissues by employing a three-stage hierarchical process to obtain accurate text\nmasks. Our method scrambles text areas in the latent start code using a\nGaussian distribution before reconstruction. During the diffusion denoising\nprocess, self-attention key and value are referenced from the original latent\nto restore the compromised background. Latent codes saved at each inversion\nstep are used for replacement during reconstruction, ensuring perfect\nbackground restoration. The advantages of TextDestroyer include: (1) it\neliminates labor-intensive data annotation and resource-intensive training; (2)\nit achieves more thorough text destruction, preventing recognizable traces; and\n(3) it demonstrates better generalization capabilities, performing well on both\nreal-world scenes and generated images.",

      "abstract": "Relighting of human images enables post-photography editing of lighting\neffects in portraits. The current mainstream approach uses neural networks to\napproximate lighting effects without explicitly accounting for the principle of\nphysical shading. As a result, it often has difficulty representing\nhigh-frequency shadows and shading. In this paper, we propose a two-stage\nrelighting method that can reproduce physically-based shadows and shading from\nlow to high frequencies. The key idea is to approximate an environment light\nsource with a set of a fixed number of area light sources. The first stage\nemploys supervised inverse rendering from a single image using neural networks\nand calculates physically-based shading. The second stage then calculates\nshadow for each area light and sums up to render the final image. We propose to\nmake soft shadow mapping differentiable for the area-light approximation of\nenvironment lighting.

      "abstract": "Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms have been applied successfully\nto challenging robot motion planning and under-actuated nonlinear control\nproblems. However a fundamental limitation of the RRT approach is the slow\nconvergence in configuration spaces with narrow channels because of the small\nprobability of generating test points inside narrow channels. This paper\npresents an improved RRT algorithm that takes advantage of narrow channels\nbetween the initial and goal states to find shorter paths by improving the\nexploration of narrow regions in the configuration space. The proposed\nalgorithm detects the presence of narrow channel by checking for collision of\nneighborhood points with the infeasible set and attempts to add points within\nnarrow channels with a predetermined bias. This approach is compared with the\nclassical RRT and its variants on a variety of benchmark planning problems.\nSimulation results indicate that the algorithm presented in this paper computes\na significantly shorter path in spaces with narrow channels.",

A\nkey feature of the proposed approach is to allow for time-varying stationarity\nin some time periods, time-varying nonstationarity (i.e., unit root or\nlocal-to-unit root behavior) in other periods, and smooth transitions between\nthe two. The estimation of the AR parameter at any time point is based on a\nlocal least squares regression method, where the relevant initial condition is\nendogenous.

To address this issue, recent studies attempt\nto identify and leverage bias-conflicting samples free from spurious\ncorrelations without prior knowledge of bias or an unbiased set. However,\nspurious correlation remains an ongoing challenge, primarily due to the\ndifficulty in precisely detecting these samples. In this paper, inspired by the\nsimilarities between mislabeled samples and bias-conflicting samples, we\napproach this challenge from a novel perspective of mislabeled sample\ndetection. Specifically, we delve into Influence Function, one of the standard\nmethods for mislabeled sample detection, for identifying bias-conflicting\nsamples and propose a simple yet effective remedy for biased models by\nleveraging them. Through comprehensive analysis and experiments on diverse\ndatasets, we demonstrate that our new perspective can boost the precision of\ndetection and rectify biased models effectively.

      "abstract": "In the paradigm of decentralized learning, a group of agents collaborate to\nlearn a global model using a distributed dataset without a central server;\nnevertheless, it is severely challenged by the heterogeneity of the data\ndistribution across the agents. For example, the data may be distributed\nnon-independently and identically, and even be noised or poisoned. To address\nthese data challenges, we propose ROSS, a novel robust decentralized stochastic\nlearning algorithm based on Shapley values, in this paper. Specifically, in\neach round, each agent aggregates the cross-gradient information from its\nneighbors, i.e., the derivatives of its local model with respect to the\ndatasets of its neighbors, to update its local model in a momentum like manner,\nwhile we innovate in weighting the derivatives according to their contributions\nmeasured by Shapley values. We perform solid theoretical analysis to reveal the\nlinear convergence speedup of our ROSS algorithm. We also verify the efficacy\nof our algorithm through extensive experiments on public datasets. Our results\ndemonstrate that, in face of the above variety of data challenges, our ROSS\nalgorithm have oblivious advantages over existing state-of-the-art proposals in\nterms of both convergence and prediction accuracy.",

We utilise these two MTG and ATG to compute the density enhancement\nfactor of CRs as a function of the magnetic field and the redshift. For this\nwork, we take the magnetic field strength from $1-100$ nG, while $0-2.5$ for\nthe redshift. For each of these parameters, we take $100$ bins within their\nconsidered range for the computation. The enhancement parameter for the mixed\ncomposition of heavy nuclei up to Fe is also taken into account for this work.\nFurther, we compute the $E^3$ magnified diffusive flux for $150$ sources\nseparated by a distance $d_\\text{s}$ for the different cosmological models. For\nthe fitting with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and\nTelescope Array (TA), we parameterized some set that consists of the redshift\n$z$, the separation distances $d_\\text{s}$ between the $150$ sources, and the\nmaximum cutoff energy $E_{\\text{max}}$. For each case, a residue plot and\n$\\chi^2$ value are also added to check the goodness of fitting. A comparative\nanalysis of considered models has been performed in each of the cases along\nwith the $\\Lambda$CDM model. The considered MTG and ATG models produce notable\nand fascinating outcomes, with the $f(Q)$ model showing the highest CR density\nenhancement and the lowest reduced chi-squared value when fitted to PAO and TA\ndata of UHECRs flux.

      "abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the design of optimal sparse\n$H_\\infty$ controllers for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems. The\nsparsity of a controller has received increasing attention as it represents the\ncommunication and computation efficiency of feedback networks. However, the\ndesign of optimal sparse $H_\\infty$ controllers remains an open and challenging\nproblem due to its non-convexity, and we cannot design a first-order algorithm\nto analyze since we lack an analytical expression for a given controller. In\nthis paper, we consider two typical problems. First, design a sparse $H_\\infty$\ncontroller subject to a specified threshold, which minimizes the sparsity of\nthe controller while satisfying the given performance requirement. Second,\ndesign a sparsity-promoting $H_\\infty$ controller, which strikes a balance\nbetween the system performance and the controller sparsity. For both problems,\nwe propose a relaxed convex problem and we show that any feasible solution of\nthe relaxed problem is feasible for the original problem. Subsequently, we\ndesign an iterative linear matrix inequality (ILMI) for both problems with\nguaranteed convergence. We further characterize the first-order optimality\nusing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and prove that any limit point of\nthe solution sequence is a stationary point. Finally, we validate the\neffectiveness of our algorithms through several numerical simulations.",

This is straightforward to visualize in contexts like\nlow-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distributions, but more difficult for\nmixture models because of the way latent variable assignment and\ncluster-specific parameters influence one another. Here we analyze correlation\nin the space of latent variables and show that latent variables of outlier\nobservations equidistant between component distributions can exhibit\nsignificant correlation that is not bounded away from one, suggesting they can\nconverge very slowly to their stationary distribution.

      "abstract": "The neural network memorization problem is to study the expressive power of\nneural networks to interpolate a finite dataset. Although memorization is\nwidely believed to have a close relationship with the strong generalizability\nof deep learning when using over-parameterized models, to the best of our\nknowledge, there exists no theoretical study on the generalizability of\nmemorization neural networks. In this paper, we give the first theoretical\nanalysis of this topic. Since using i.i.d. training data is a necessary\ncondition for a learning algorithm to be generalizable, memorization and its\ngeneralization theory for i.i.d. datasets are developed under mild conditions\non the data distribution. First, algorithms are given to construct memorization\nnetworks for an i.i.d. dataset, which have the smallest number of parameters\nand even a constant number of parameters. Second, we show that, in order for\nthe memorization networks to be generalizable, the width of the network must be\nat least equal to the dimension of the data, which implies that the existing\nmemorization networks with an optimal number of parameters are not\ngeneralizable. Third, a lower bound for the sample complexity of general\nmemorization algorithms and the exact sample complexity for memorization\nalgorithms with constant number of parameters are given. It is also shown that\nthere exist data distributions such that, to be generalizable for them, the\nmemorization network must have an exponential number of parameters in the data\ndimension. Finally, an efficient and generalizable memorization algorithm is\ngiven when the number of training samples is greater than the efficient\nmemorization sample complexity of the data distribution.",

To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel neural network (NN)-empowered framework for IRS channel\nautocorrelation matrix estimation in wideband orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) systems. This framework relies only on the easily\naccessible reference signal received power (RSRP) measurements at users in\nexisting wideband communication systems, without requiring additional pilot\ntransmission.

      "abstract": "The growth of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides using\nchemical vapor deposition has been an area of intense study, primarily due to\nthe scalability requirements for potential device applications. One of the\nmajor challenges of such growths is the large-scale thickness variation of the\ngrown film. To investigate the role of different growth parameters\ncomputationally, we use a 2D asymmetric simple-exclusion process (ASEP) model\nwith open boundaries as an approximation to the dynamics of deposition on the\ncoarse-grained lattice. The variations in concentration of particles (growth\nprofiles) at the lattice sites in the grown film are studied as functions of\nparameters like injection and ejection rate of particles from the lattice, time\nof observation, and the right bias (difference between the hopping\nprobabilities towards right and towards left) imposed by the carrier gas. In\naddition, the deposition rates at a given coarse-grained site is assumed to\ndepend on the occupancy of that site. The effect of the maximum deposition\nrate, i.e., the deposition rate at a completely unoccupied site on the\nsubstrate, has been explored. The growth profiles stretch horizontally when\neither the evolution time or the right bias is increased. An increased\ndeposition rate leads to a step-like profile, with the higher density region\nclose to the left edge. In 3D, the growth profiles become more uniform with the\nincrease in the height of the precursor with respect to the substrate surface.\nThese results qualitatively agree with the experimental observations.",

Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of\nDeepCore in identifying various piracy models, achieving lower missed and false\nidentification rates, and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "In numerous artificial intelligence applications, the collaborative efforts\nof multiple intelligent agents are imperative for the successful attainment of\ntarget objectives. To enhance coordination among these agents, a distributed\ncommunication framework is often employed. However, indiscriminate information\nsharing among all agents can be resource-intensive, and the adoption of\nmanually pre-defined communication architectures imposes constraints on\ninter-agent communication, thus limiting the potential for effective\ncollaboration. Moreover, the communication framework often remains static\nduring inference, which may result in sustained high resource consumption, as\nin most cases, only key decisions necessitate information sharing among agents.\nIn this study, we introduce a novel approach wherein we conceptualize the\ncommunication architecture among agents as a learnable graph. We formulate this\nproblem as the task of determining the communication graph while enabling the\narchitecture parameters to update normally, thus necessitating a bi-level\noptimization process. Utilizing continuous relaxation of the graph\nrepresentation and incorporating attention units, our proposed approach,\nCommFormer, efficiently optimizes the communication graph and concurrently\nrefines architectural parameters through gradient descent in an end-to-end\nmanner. Additionally, we introduce a temporal gating mechanism for each agent,\nenabling dynamic decisions on whether to receive shared information at a given\ntime, based on current observations, thus improving decision-making efficiency.\nExtensive experiments on a variety of cooperative tasks substantiate the\nrobustness of our model across diverse cooperative scenarios, where agents are\nable to develop more coordinated and sophisticated strategies regardless of\nchanges in the number of agents.",

      "abstract": "Monolayer semiconductors, given their thickness at the atomic scale, present\nunique electrostatic environments due to the sharp interfaces between the\nsemiconductor film and surrounding materials. These interfaces significantly\nimpact both the quasiparticle band structure and the electrostatic interactions\nbetween charge carriers. Akey area of interest in these materials is the\nbehavior of bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) within the ultra-thin layer,\nwhich plays a crucial role in its optoelectronic properties. In this work, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of generating potential traps that completely\nconfine excitons in the thin semiconductor by engineering the surrounding\ndielectric environment. By evaluating the simultaneous effects on bandgap\nrenormalization and modifications to the strength of the electron-hole\nCoulomb-interaction, both associated to the modulation of the screening by the\nmaterials sandwiching the monolayer, we anticipate the existence of low-energy\nregions in which the localization of the exciton center of mass may be\nachieved. Our results suggest that for certain dielectric configurations, it is\npossible to generate complete discretization of exciton eigenenergies in the\norder of tens of meV.

The analysis determines the sensitivity of\nbound-state energies, scattering phase shifts and cross sections on the cutoff\nparameter ($\\lambda$), and the energy gaps between scattering thresholds. The\nlatter dependency is obtained with a 2-body scale fixed to an unnaturally large\nvalue and a floating 3-body parameter. Specifically, we calculate the binding\nenergies of the shallow 3- and 4-body states, dimer-dimer and trimer-atom\nscattering lengths, and the trimer-atom to dimer-dimer reaction rates.\nEmploying a potential renormalized by a large 2-body scattering length and a\n3-body scale, we find all calculated observables to remain practically constant\nover the range $6\\textrm{fm}^{-2}<\\lambda<10\\textrm{fm}^{-2}$. Divergences in\nscattering lengths emerge for critical 3-body parameters at which thresholds\nare degenerate. Such threshold effects are found to be independent of the\nregulator cutoff.\n  Furthermore, at those critical points where the dimer-dimer and trimer-atom\nthresholds overlap, we predict an enhancement of the inelastic over the elastic\nscattering event. Such an inversion between elastic- and\nrearrangement-collision probabilities indicates a strong sensitivity of the\n4-body reaction dynamics on the 3-body parameter at finite 2-body scale. This\nphenomenon is absent in earlier studies which differ in the renormalization\nscheme. As this discrepancy arises for all considered cutoffs, a more\ncomprehensive parametrization of short-distance structure is necessary: sole\ncutoff variation does not reveal non-perturbative change in reaction rates\nconjectured to be due to a combined effect of the finite 2-body range and the\nspecific choice for the 3-body parameter.",

However, dimensional\ncollapse, where a few large eigenvalues dominate the eigenspace, poses a\nsignificant obstacle for SSL. When dimensional collapse occurs on features\n(e.g. hidden features and representations), it prevents features from\nrepresenting the full information of the data; when dimensional collapse occurs\non weight matrices, their filters are self-related and redundant, limiting\ntheir expressive power. Existing studies have predominantly concentrated on the\ndimensional collapse of representations, neglecting whether this can\nsufficiently prevent the dimensional collapse of the weight matrices and hidden\nfeatures. To this end, we first time propose a mitigation approach employing\northogonal regularization (OR) across the encoder, targeting both convolutional\nand linear layers during pretraining.

      "abstract": "Scalar variables, e.g., the orientation of a shape in an image, are commonly\npredicted using a single output neuron in a neural network. In contrast, the\nmammalian cortex represents variables with a population of neurons. In this\npopulation code, each neuron is most active at its preferred value and shows\npartial activity for other values. Here, we investigate the benefit of using a\npopulation code for the output layer of a neural network. We compare population\ncodes against single-neuron outputs and one-hot vectors. First, we show\ntheoretically and in experiments with synthetic data that population codes\nimprove robustness to input noise in networks of stacked linear layers. Second,\nwe demonstrate the benefit of using population codes to encode ambiguous\noutputs, such as the pose of symmetric objects. Using the T-LESS dataset of\nfeature-less real-world objects, we show that population codes improve the\naccuracy of predicting 3D object orientation from image input.",

      "abstract": "In question-answering scenarios, humans can assess whether the available\ninformation is sufficient and seek additional information if necessary, rather\nthan providing a forced answer. In contrast, Vision Language Models (VLMs)\ntypically generate direct, one-shot responses without evaluating the\nsufficiency of the information. To investigate this gap, we identify a critical\nand challenging task in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) scenario: can VLMs\nindicate how to adjust an image when the visual information is insufficient to\nanswer a question? This capability is especially valuable for assisting\nvisually impaired individuals who often need guidance to capture images\ncorrectly. To evaluate this capability of current VLMs, we introduce a\nhuman-labeled dataset as a benchmark for this task. Additionally, we present an\nautomated framework that generates synthetic training data by simulating\n``where to know'' scenarios. Our empirical results show significant performance\nimprovements in mainstream VLMs when fine-tuned with this synthetic data. This\nstudy demonstrates the potential to narrow the gap between information\nassessment and acquisition in VLMs, bringing their performance closer to\nhumans.",

Magnetic\nhopfions are also regarded as superstructures constructed from closed loops of\ntwisted skyrmion strings, which behave as another independent particles.\nHowever, it remains elusive whether such magnetic hopfions can also aggregate\nto form higher-level superstructures. Here, we report a stable superstructure\nwith three-dimensional periodic arrangement of magnetic hopfions in a\nfrustrated spin model with easy-plane anisotropy. By comprehensively examining\neffective interactions between two hopfions, we construct the hopfion\nsuperstructure by a staggered arrangement of one-dimensional hopfion chains\nwith Hopf number $H=+1$ and $H=-1$ running perpendicular to the easy plane.\nEach hopfion chain is threaded by a magnetic meron string, resulting in a\nnontrivial topological texture with skyrmion number $N_{\\rm sk}=2$ per magnetic\nunit cell on any two-dimensional cut parallel to the easy plane. We show that\nthe hopfion superstructure remains robust as a metastable state across a range\nof the hopfion density.

      "abstract": "Style-guided texture generation aims to generate a texture that is harmonious\nwith both the style of the reference image and the geometry of the input mesh,\ngiven a reference style image and a 3D mesh with its text description. Although\ndiffusion-based 3D texture generation methods, such as distillation sampling,\nhave numerous promising applications in stylized games and films, it requires\naddressing two challenges: 1) decouple style and content completely from the\nreference image for 3D models, and 2) align the generated texture with the\ncolor tone, style of the reference image, and the given text prompt. To this\nend, we introduce StyleTex, an innovative diffusion-model-based framework for\ncreating stylized textures for 3D models. Our key insight is to decouple style\ninformation from the reference image while disregarding content in\ndiffusion-based distillation sampling. Specifically, given a reference image,\nwe first decompose its style feature from the image CLIP embedding by\nsubtracting the embedding's orthogonal projection in the direction of the\ncontent feature, which is represented by a text CLIP embedding. Our novel\napproach to disentangling the reference image's style and content information\nallows us to generate distinct style and content features. We then inject the\nstyle feature into the cross-attention mechanism to incorporate it into the\ngeneration process, while utilizing the content feature as a negative prompt to\nfurther dissociate content information. Finally, we incorporate these\nstrategies into StyleTex to obtain stylized textures. The resulting textures\ngenerated by StyleTex retain the style of the reference image, while also\naligning with the text prompts and intrinsic details of the given 3D mesh.\nQuantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms\nexisting baseline methods by a significant margin.",

In this paper, we propose a novel\nalgorithm called HAVER (Head AVERaging) and analyze its mean squared error. Our\nanalysis reveals that HAVER has a compelling performance in two respects.\nFirst, HAVER estimates the maximum mean as well as the oracle who knows the\nidentity of the best distribution and reports its sample mean. Second, perhaps\nsurprisingly, HAVER exhibits even better rates than this oracle when there are\nmany distributions near the best one. Both of these improvements are the first\nof their kind in the literature, and we also prove that the naive algorithm\nthat reports the largest empirical mean does not achieve these bounds. Finally,\nwe confirm our theoretical findings via numerical experiments including bandits\nand Q-learning scenarios where HAVER outperforms baseline methods.",

A fraction of ULXs has been confirmed to\ncontain neutron star (NS) accretors due to the discovery of their X-ray\npulsations. The donors detected in NS ULXs are usually luminous massive stars\nbecause of the observational biases. Recently, the He donor star in NGC 247\nULX-1 has been identified, which is the first evidence of a He donor star in\nULXs. In this paper, we employed the stellar evolution code MESA to investigate\nthe formation of ULXs through the NS+He star channel, in which a He star\ntransfers its He-rich material onto the surface of a NS via Roche-lobe\noverflow. We evolved a large number of NS+He star systems and provided the\nparameter space for the production of ULXs. We found that the initial NS+He\nstar systems should have $\\rm\\sim 0.7-2.6 \\, M_\\odot$ He star and $\\rm \\sim\n0.1-2500\\, d$ orbital period for producing ULXs, eventually evolving into\nintermediate-mass binary pulsars.

      "abstract": "Neural-networks-driven intelligent data-plane (NN-driven IDP) is becoming an\nemerging topic for excellent accuracy and high performance. Meanwhile we argue\nthat NN-driven IDP should satisfy three design goals: the flexibility to\nsupport various NNs models, the low-latency-high-throughput inference\nperformance, and the data-plane-unawareness harming no performance and\nfunctionality. Unfortunately, existing work either over-modify NNs for IDP, or\ninsert inline pipelined accelerators into the data-plane, failing to meet the\nflexibility and unawareness goals.\n  In this paper, we propose Kaleidoscope, a flexible and high-performance\nco-processor located at the bypass of the data-plane. To address the challenge\nof meeting three design goals, three key techniques are presented. The\nprogrammable run-to-completion accelerators are developed for flexible\ninference. To further improve performance, we design a scalable inference\nengine which completes low-latency and low-cost inference for the mouse flows,\nand perform complex NNs with high-accuracy for the elephant flows. Finally,\nraw-bytes-based NNs are introduced, which help to achieve unawareness. We\nprototype Kaleidoscope on both FPGA and ASIC library. In evaluation on six NNs\nmodels, Kaleidoscope reaches 256-352 ns inference latency and 100 Gbps\nthroughput with negligible influence on the data-plane. The on-board tested NNs\nperform state-of-the-art accuracy among other NN-driven IDP, exhibiting the the\nsignificant impact of flexibility on enhancing traffic analysis accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) provide remarkable zero-shot\nclassification capability covering a wide variety of object classes. However,\npractical applications do not always require the classification of all kinds of\nobjects, and leaving the model capable of recognizing unnecessary classes not\nonly degrades overall accuracy but also leads to operational disadvantages. To\nmitigate this issue, we explore the selective forgetting problem for PTMs,\nwhere the task is to make the model unable to recognize only the specified\nclasses while maintaining accuracy for the rest. All the existing methods\nassume \"white-box\" settings, where model information such as architectures,\nparameters, and gradients is available for training. However, PTMs are often\n\"black-box,\" where information on such models is unavailable for commercial\nreasons or social responsibilities. In this paper, we address a novel problem\nof selective forgetting for black-box models, named Black-Box Forgetting, and\npropose an approach to the problem. Given that information on the model is\nunavailable, we optimize the input prompt to decrease the accuracy of specified\nclasses through derivative-free optimization. To avoid difficult\nhigh-dimensional optimization while ensuring high forgetting performance, we\npropose Latent Context Sharing, which introduces common low-dimensional latent\ncomponents among multiple tokens for the prompt. Experiments on four standard\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method with reasonable\nbaselines. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/yusukekwn/Black-Box-Forgetting.",

      "abstract": "Sunspot-area measurements using digital images captured by two telescopes at\nthe Mitaka campus of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan are\nconducted using automated sunspot detection. A comparison between sunspot areas\nderived from Mitaka and those from the reference data by Mandal et al. ({\\it\nAstron. Astrophys.} {\\bf 640,} A78, 2020), who compiled a cross-calibrated\ndaily sunspot-area catalog, revealed that the correlation coefficients between\nthem are high (0.96--0.97), whereas the areas in the Mitaka data are 70 \\%--83\n\\% of those of Mandal et al. The correlation is limited by the differences in\nobservation times and detection capabilities of spots near the limb, with\ndiscrepancies in areas arising from different definitions of spot outlines.\nGiven the high correlation and the ease of calibrating area discrepancies with\na correction factor, automated sunspot detection appears promising for future\nsunspot-area measurements.

      "abstract": "We present a new Lyapunov-based switching attitude controller for\nenergy-efficient real-time selection of the torque inputted to an uncrewed\naerial vehicle (UAV) during flight. The proposed method, using quaternions to\ndescribe the attitude of the controlled UAV, interchanges the stability\nproperties of the two fixed points-one locally asymptotically stable and\nanother unstable-of the resulting closed-loop (CL) switching dynamics of the\nsystem. In this approach, the switching events are triggered by the value of a\ncompound energy-based function. To analyze and ensure the stability of the CL\nswitching dynamics, we use classical nonlinear Lyapunov techniques, in\ncombination with switching-systems theory. For this purpose, we introduce a new\ncompound Lyapunov function (LF) that not only enables us to derive the\nconditions for CL asymptotic and exponential stability, but also provides us\nwith an estimate of the CL system's region of attraction. This new estimate is\nconsiderably larger than those previously reported for systems of the type\nconsidered in this paper. To test and demonstrate the functionality,\nsuitability, and performance of the proposed method, we present and discuss\nexperimental data obtained using a 31-g quadrotor during the execution of\nhigh-speed yaw-tracking maneuvers. Also, we provide empirical evidence\nindicating that all the initial conditions chosen for these maneuvers, as\nestimated, lie inside the system's region of attraction. Last, experimental\ndata obtained through these flight tests show that the proposed switching\ncontroller reduces the control effort by about 53%, on average, with respect to\nthat corresponding to a commonly used benchmark control scheme, when executing\na particular type of high-speed yaw-tracking maneuvers.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a crucial technique for\naligning language models with human preferences, playing a pivotal role in the\nsuccess of conversational models like GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Llama 2. A core\nchallenge in employing RLHF lies in training a reliable reward model (RM),\nwhich relies on high-quality labels typically provided by human experts or\nadvanced AI system. These methods can be costly and may introduce biases that\naffect the language model's responses. As language models improve, human input\nmay become less effective in further enhancing their performance. In this\npaper, we propose Self-Evolved Reward Learning (SER), a novel approach where\nthe RM generates additional training data to iteratively improve itself. We\nconducted extensive experiments on multiple datasets such as HH-RLHF and\nUltraFeedback, using models like Mistral and Llama 3, and compare SER against\nvarious baselines. Our results demonstrate that even with limited\nhuman-annotated data, learning from self-feedback can robustly enhance RM\nperformance, thereby boosting the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).",

It is the first to achieve egocentric human mesh reconstruction\nin a multi-view manner. Compared with conventional frontal-view mmWave sensing\nsolutions, it addresses several pain points, such as restricted sensing range,\nocclusion, and the multipath effect caused by surroundings. To overcome the\nlimited capabilities of the stripped-down mmWave radars (with only one transmit\nantenna and three receive antennas), we tackle three main challenges and\npropose a holistic solution, including tailored hardware design, sophisticated\nsignal processing, and a deep neural network optimized for high-dimensional\ncomplex point clouds. Extensive evaluation shows that Argus achieves\nperformance comparable to traditional solutions based on high-capability mmWave\nradars, with an average vertex error of 6.5 cm, solely using stripped-down\nradars deployed in a multi-view configuration. It presents robustness and\npracticality across conditions, such as with unseen users and different host\ndevices.",

Specifically, we examine the\nimpact of general knowledge about firms on the sentiment measurement of texts\nby LLMs. Firstly, we compare the sentiment scores of financial texts by LLMs\nwhen the company name is explicitly included in the prompt versus when it is\nnot. We define and quantify company-specific bias as the difference between\nthese scores. Next, we construct an economic model to theoretically evaluate\nthe impact of sentiment bias on investor behavior. This model helps us\nunderstand how biased LLM investments, when widespread, can distort stock\nprices. This implies the potential impact on stock prices if investments driven\nby biased LLMs become dominant in the future. Finally, we conduct an empirical\nanalysis using Japanese financial text data to examine the relationship between\nfirm-specific sentiment bias, corporate characteristics, and stock performance.",

However, existing protocols either face severe scalability issues\ndue to high on-chain and off-chain costs, or suffer from trust concerns because\nof centralized designs.\n  In this paper, we propose \\texttt{MAP}, a trustless blockchain\ninteroperability protocol that relays cross-chain transactions across\nheterogeneous chains with high scalability. First, within \\texttt{MAP}, we\ndevelop a novel \\textit{cross-chain relay} technique, which integrates a\nunified relay chain architecture and on-chain light clients of different source\nchains, allowing the retrieval and verification of diverse cross-chain\ntransactions. Furthermore, we reduce cross-chain verification costs by\nincorporating an optimized zk-based light client scheme that adaptively\ndecouples signature verification overheads from inefficient smart contract\nexecution and offloads them to off-chain provers. For experiments, we conducted\nthe first large-scale evaluation on existing interoperability protocols. With\n\\texttt{MAP}, the required number of on-chain light clients is reduced from\n$O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$, with around 35\\% reduction in on-chain costs and 25\\%\nreduction for off-chain costs when verifying cross-chain transactions.\n  To demonstrate the effectiveness, we deployed \\texttt{MAP} in the real world.\nBy 2024, we have supported over six popular public chains, 50 cross-chain\napplications and relayed over 200K cross-chain transactions worth over 640\nmillion USD.

This is however not true for an accreting black hole\nfor which MOTS separates out and turns spacelike. In this letter, we obtain the\nnecessary and sufficient condition for MOTS to remain null and coincident with\nthe event horizon even when matter is continuously accreting on. This also has\nan important bearing on the quantum Hawking radiation which is supposed to\nemanate from the MOTS, and it cannot propagate out to infinity unless MOTS is\nnull. The condition is, infalling timelike Type I fluid should turn null or\nType II, as it falls on the horizon. This transition from timelike to null is\ncaused by the tidal deformation of the infalling fluid, and that produces an\noutward directed heat flux giving rise to Vaidya radiation emanating out of the\nboundary of accreting zone. We thus predict a remarkable new phenomena that\naccreting black hole radiates classical Vaidya radiation that paves the way for\nthe Hawking radiation.",

      "abstract": "Accurate prediction of Global Warming Potential (GWP) is essential for\nassessing the environmental impact of chemical processes and materials.\nTraditional GWP prediction models rely predominantly on molecular structure,\noverlooking critical process-related information. In this study, we present an\nintegrative GWP prediction model that combines molecular descriptors (MACCS\nkeys and Mordred descriptors) with process information (process title,\ndescription, and location) to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability.\nUsing a deep neural network (DNN) model, we achieved an R-squared of 86% on\ntest data with Mordred descriptors, process location, and description\ninformation, representing a 25% improvement over the previous benchmark of 61%;\nXAI analysis further highlighted the significant role of process title\nembeddings in enhancing model predictions. To enhance interpretability, we\nemployed a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to derive a symbolic formula for GWP\nprediction, capturing key molecular and process features and providing a\ntransparent, interpretable alternative to black-box models, enabling users to\ngain insights into the molecular and process factors influencing GWP. Error\nanalysis showed that the model performs reliably in densely populated data\nranges, with increased uncertainty for higher GWP values. This analysis allows\nusers to manage prediction uncertainty effectively, supporting data-driven\ndecision-making in chemical and process design. Our results suggest that\nintegrating both molecular and process-level information in GWP prediction\nmodels yields substantial gains in accuracy and interpretability, offering a\nvaluable tool for sustainability assessments. Future work may extend this\napproach to additional environmental impact categories and refine the model to\nfurther enhance its predictive reliability.",

      "abstract": "Nontrivial spectral properties of non-Hermitian systems can give rise to\nintriguing effects that lack counterparts in Hermitian systems. For instance,\nwhen dynamically varying system parameters along a path enclosing an\nexceptional point (EP), chiral mode conversion occurs. A recent study [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 133, 113802 (2024)] demonstrates the achievability of pure adiabatic\nstate transfer by specifically selecting a trajectory in the system parameter\nspace where the corresponding evolution operator exhibits a real spectrum while\nwinding around an EP. However, the intended adiabatic state transfer becomes\nfragile when taking into account the effect of the nonadiabatic transition. In\nthis work, we propose a scheme for achieving robust and rapid adiabatic state\ntransfer in time-modulated two-level non-Hermitian systems by appropriately\nmodulating system Hamiltonian and time-evolution trajectory. Numerical\nsimulations confirm that complete adiabatic transfer can always be achieved\neven under nonadiabatic conditions after one period for different initialized\nadiabatic states, and the scheme remains insensitive to moderate fluctuations\nin control parameters. Therefore, this scheme offers alternative approaches for\nquantum-state engineering in non-Hermitian systems.",

The\ngoal is to recover an estimate of $S$ from a set of independently drawn traces.\nIn the case that all $p_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ this is the standard trace\nreconstruction problem. We show two complementary results. First, for\nworst-case strings $S$ and any deletion probability at least order\n$1/\\sqrt{n}$, no algorithm can approximate $S$ to constant $\\ell_\\infty$\ndistance or $\\ell_1$ distance $o(\\sqrt n)$ using fewer than\n$2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})}$ traces. Second -- as in the case for standard trace\nreconstruction -- reconstruction is easy for random $S$: for any sufficiently\nsmall constant deletion probability, and any $\\epsilon>0$, drawing each $p_i$\nindependently from the uniform distribution over $[0,1]$, with high probability\n$S$ can be recovered to $\\ell_1$ error $\\epsilon$ using\n$\\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\\epsilon)$ traces and computation time.

We obtained a reliable constraint on the ionization\ntemperature just before the transition into the overionization state, to be > 4\nkeV. The recombination timescale was constrained to be < $8\\times10^{11}$\ncm$^{-3}$ s. The small velocity dispersion of $109\\pm6$ km s$^{-1}$ indicates a\nlow Fe ion temperature < 8 keV and a small expansion velocity < 200 km\ns$^{-1}$.

      "abstract": "Efficiently modeling large 2D contexts is essential for various fields\nincluding Giga-Pixel Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) and remote sensing.\nTransformer-based models offer high parallelism but face challenges due to\ntheir quadratic complexity for handling long sequences. Recently, Mamba\nintroduced a selective State Space Model (SSM) with linear complexity and high\nparallelism, enabling effective and efficient modeling of wide context in 1D\nsequences. However, extending Mamba to vision tasks, which inherently involve\n2D structures, results in spatial discrepancies due to the limitations of 1D\nsequence processing. On the other hand, current 2D SSMs inherently model 2D\nstructures but they suffer from prohibitively slow computation due to the lack\nof efficient parallel algorithms. In this work, we propose 2DMamba, a novel 2D\nselective SSM framework that incorporates the 2D spatial structure of images\ninto Mamba, with a highly optimized hardware-aware operator, adopting both\nspatial continuity and computational efficiency. We validate the versatility of\nour approach on both WSIs and natural images. Extensive experiments on 10\npublic datasets for WSI classification and survival analysis show that\n2DMamba~improves up to $2.48\\%$ in AUC, $3.11\\%$ in F1 score, $2.47\\%$ in\naccuracy and $5.52\\%$ in C-index.

      "abstract": "Remote estimation is a crucial element of real time monitoring of a\nstochastic process. While most of the existing works have concentrated on\nobtaining optimal sampling strategies, motivated by malicious attacks on\ncyber-physical systems, we model sensing under surveillance as a game between\nan attacker and a defender. This introduces strategic elements to conventional\nremote estimation problems. Additionally, inspired by increasing detection\ncapabilities, we model an element of information leakage for each player.\nParameterizing the game in terms of uncertainty on each side, information\nleakage, and cost of sampling, we consider the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE)\nconcept where one of the players acts as the leader and the other one as the\nfollower. By focusing our attention on stationary probabilistic sampling\npolicies, we characterize the SE of this game and provide simulations to show\nthe efficacy of our results.",

Existing 3DGS-based\nSLAM methods often fall short in sparse view settings and during large camera\nmovements due to their reliance on gradient descent-based optimization, which\nis both slow and inaccurate. FlashSLAM addresses these limitations by combining\n3DGS with a fast vision-based camera tracking technique, utilizing a pretrained\nfeature matching model and point cloud registration for precise pose estimation\nin under 80 ms - a 90% reduction in tracking time compared to SplaTAM - without\ncostly iterative rendering. In sparse settings, our method achieves up to a 92%\nimprovement in average tracking accuracy over previous methods. Additionally,\nit accounts for noise in depth sensors, enhancing robustness when using\nunspecialized devices such as smartphones. Extensive experiments show that\nFlashSLAM performs reliably across both sparse and dense settings, in synthetic\nand real-world environments.

      "abstract": "In the Fourier frequency domain, luminance information is primarily encoded\nin the amplitude component, while spatial structure information is\nsignificantly contained within the phase component. Existing low-light image\nenhancement techniques using Fourier transform have mainly focused on\namplifying the amplitude component and simply replicating the phase component,\nan approach that often leads to color distortions and noise issues. In this\npaper, we propose a Dual-Stage Multi-Branch Fourier Low-Light Image Enhancement\n(DMFourLLIE) framework to address these limitations by emphasizing the phase\ncomponent's role in preserving image structure and detail. The first stage\nintegrates structural information from infrared images to enhance the phase\ncomponent and employs a luminance-attention mechanism in the\nluminance-chrominance color space to precisely control amplitude enhancement.\nThe second stage combines multi-scale and Fourier convolutional branches for\nrobust image reconstruction, effectively recovering spatial structures and\ntextures. This dual-branch joint optimization process ensures that complex\nimage information is retained, overcoming the limitations of previous methods\nthat neglected the interplay between amplitude and phase. Extensive experiments\nacross multiple datasets demonstrate that DMFourLLIE outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art methods in low-light image enhancement.

      "abstract": "The current Bayesian FFT algorithm relies on direct differentiation to obtain\nthe posterior covariance matrix (PCM), which is time-consuming,\nmemory-intensive, and hard to code, especially for the multi-setup operational\nmodal analysis (OMA). Aiming at accelerating the uncertainty quantification in\nmulti-setup OMA, an expectation-maximization (EM)-based algorithm is proposed\nby reformulating the Hessian matrix of the negative log-likelihood function\n(NLLF) as a sum of simplified components corresponding to the complete-data\nNLLF. Matrix calculus is employed to derive these components in a compact\nmanner, resulting in expressions similar to those in the single-setup case.\nThis similarity allows for the reuse of existing Bayesian single-setup OMA\ncodes, simplifying implementation. The singularity caused by mode shape norm\nconstraints is addressed through null space projection, eliminating potential\nnumerical errors from the conventional pseudoinverse operation. A sparse\nassembly strategy is further adopted, avoiding unnecessary calculations and\nstorage of predominant zero elements in the Hessian matrix. The proposed method\nis then validated through a comprehensive parametric study and applied to a\nmulti-setup OMA of a high-rise building. Results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod efficiently calculates the PCM within seconds, even for cases with\nhundreds of parameters. This represents an efficiency improvement of at least\none order of magnitude over the state-of-the-art method. Such performance paves\nthe way for a real-time modal identification of large-scale structures,\nincluding those with closely-spaced modes.",

      "abstract": "Object perception from multi-view cameras is crucial for intelligent systems,\nparticularly in indoor environments, e.g., warehouses, retail stores, and\nhospitals. Most traditional multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) detection and\ntracking methods rely on 2D object detection, single-view multi-object tracking\n(MOT), and cross-view re-identification (ReID) techniques, without properly\nhandling important 3D information by multi-view image aggregation. In this\npaper, we propose a 3D object detection and tracking framework, named\nBEV-SUSHI, which first aggregates multi-view images with necessary camera\ncalibration parameters to obtain 3D object detections in bird's-eye view (BEV).\nThen, we introduce hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs) to track these 3D\ndetections in BEV for MTMC tracking results. Unlike existing methods, BEV-SUSHI\nhas impressive generalizability across different scenes and diverse camera\nsettings, with exceptional capability for long-term association handling. As a\nresult, our proposed BEV-SUSHI establishes the new state-of-the-art on the\nAICity'24 dataset with 81.22 HOTA, and 95.6 IDF1 on the WildTrack dataset.",

      "abstract": "Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics corrections and the colour\nsuperconductivity indicate that strongly interacting matter can manifest unique\nphysical behaviours under extreme conditions. Motivated by this notion, we\ninvestigate the interior structure and properties of quark stars composed of\ninteracting quark matter, which provides a comprehensive avenue to explore the\nstrong interaction effects, within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity. A unified\nequation of state is formulated to describe various phases of quark matter,\nincluding up-down quark matter $(2SC)$, strange quark matter $(2SC+s)$, and the\nColour-Flavor Locked $(CFL)$ phase. By employing a systematic reparametrisation\nand rescaling, the number of degrees of freedom in the equation of state is\nsignificantly reduced. Utilising the Buchdahl-I metric ansatz and a linear\n$f(Q)$ functional form, $f(Q)=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}Q$, we derive the exact\nsolutions of the Einstein field equations in presence of the unified\ninteracting quark matter equation of state. For the $2SC$ phase, we examine the\nproperties of quark stars composed of up-down quark matter. For the\n$(2SC+s)$and $CFL$ phases, we incorporate the effects of a finite strange quark\nmass $(m_{s}\\neq0)$. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations are numerically\nsolved to determine the maximum mass-radius relations for each phase. Our\nresults indicate that the model satisfies key physical criteria, including\ncausality, energy conditions, and stability requirements, ensuring the\nviability of the configurations. Furthermore, the predicted radii for certain\ncompact star candidates align well with observational data. The study\nhighlights that quark stars composed of interacting quark matter within the\n$f(Q)$ gravity framework provide a robust and physically consistent stellar\nmodel across all considered phases.",

This study investigates the potential for vacuum generation\nand cavitation phenomena on the Aghchai Dam service spillway through numerical\nsimulations conducted in Flow-3D. The analysis focuses on two specific flow\nrates, 4400 and 1065 cubic meters per second, as determined by experimental\ndata. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is employed to accurately calculate the\nfree surface flow. Simulation results at a discharge rate of 4400 cubic meters\nper second indicate a high likelihood of cavitation at critical locations,\nincluding the ogee curve and the angle transition in the chute channel. These\nareas require specific mitigation measures to prevent cavitation-induced\ndamage. In contrast, at the lower flow rate of 1065 cubic meters per second,\nthe risk of cavitation is minimal due to reduced flow velocity and the absence\nof flow separation from the bed. The numerical findings align closely with\nempirical observations, demonstrating the reliability of the simulation\napproach in predicting cavitation behavior.",

      "abstract": "The increasing reliance on deep computer vision models that process sensitive\ndata has raised significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding the\nexposure of intermediate results in hidden layers. While traditional privacy\nrisk assessment techniques focus on protecting overall model outputs, they\noften overlook vulnerabilities within these intermediate representations.\nCurrent privacy risk assessment techniques typically rely on specific attack\nsimulations to assess risk, which can be computationally expensive and\nincomplete. This paper introduces a novel approach to measuring privacy risks\nin deep computer vision models based on the Degrees of Freedom (DoF) and\nsensitivity of intermediate outputs, without requiring adversarial attack\nsimulations. We propose a framework that leverages DoF to evaluate the amount\nof information retained in each layer and combines this with the rank of the\nJacobian matrix to assess sensitivity to input variations. This dual analysis\nenables systematic measurement of privacy risks at various model layers. Our\nexperimental validation on real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness\nof this approach in providing deeper insights into privacy risks associated\nwith intermediate representations.",

The main steps of\nthe approach include selection of a SSL pretrained model on natural image\ndatasets, subsequent SSL retraining on all available skin lesion datasets,\nfinetuning of the model on source domain data with labels, application of UDA\nmethods on target domain data, and lastly, implementation of ADA methods. The\nefficacy of the proposed approach is assessed across ten skin lesion datasets\nof domains, demonstrating its potential for enhancing the performance of skin\nlesion classification models.

      "abstract": "Finding the maximum matching in bipartite graphs is a fundamental graph\noperation widely used in various fields. To expedite the acquisition of the\nmaximum matching, Karp and Sipser introduced two data reduction rules aimed at\ndecreasing the input size. However, the KaSi algorithm, which implements the\ntwo data reduction rules, has several drawbacks: a high upper bound on time\ncomplexity and inefficient storage structure. The poor upper bound on time\ncomplexity makes the algorithm lack robustness when dealing with extreme cases,\nand the inefficient storage structure struggles to balance vertex merging and\nneighborhood traversal operations, leading to poor performance on real-life\ngraphs. To address these issues, we introduced MVM, an algorithm incorporating\nthree novel optimization strategies to implement the data reduction rules. Our\ntheoretical analysis proves that the MVM algorithm, even when using data\nstructures with the worst search efficiency, can still maintain near-linear\ntime complexity, ensuring the algorithm's robustness. Additionally, we designed\nan innovative storage format that supports efficient vertex merging operations\nwhile preserving the locality of edge sets, thus ensuring the efficiency of\nneighborhood traversals in graph algorithms. Finally, we conduct evaluations on\nboth real-life and synthetic graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the emerging trend of extensions in modern\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code (VSCode)\nthat significantly enhance developer productivity. Especially, popular AI\ncoding assistants like GitHub Copilot and Tabnine provide conveniences like\nautomated code completion and debugging. While these extensions offer numerous\nbenefits, they may introduce privacy and security concerns to software\ndevelopers. However, there is no existing work that systematically analyzes the\nsecurity and privacy concerns, including the risks of data exposure in VSCode\nextensions.\n  In this paper, we investigate on the security issues of cross-extension\ninteractions in VSCode and shed light on the vulnerabilities caused by data\nexposure among different extensions. Our study uncovers high-impact security\nflaws that could allow adversaries to stealthily acquire or manipulate\ncredential-related data (e.g., passwords, API keys, access tokens) from other\nextensions if not properly handled by extension vendors. To measure their\nprevalence, we design a novel automated risk detection framework that leverages\nprogram analysis and natural language processing techniques to automatically\nidentify potential risks in VSCode extensions. By applying our tool to 27,261\nreal-world VSCode extensions, we discover that 8.5% of them (i.e., 2,325\nextensions) are exposed to credential-related data leakage through various\nvectors, such as commands, user input, and configurations. Our study sheds\nlight on the security challenges and flaws of the extension-in-IDE paradigm and\nprovides suggestions and recommendations for improving the security of VSCode\nextensions and mitigating the risks of data exposure.",

As an example, sufficiently\nample line bundles are very ample, moreover, for a normal variety X, the\nembedding corresponding to sufficiently ample line bundle is projectively\nnormal. The grandfather of such properties and a basic ingredient used to study\nthis concept is Fujita vanishing theorem, which is a strengthening of Serre\nvanishing to sufficiently ample line bundles. The r-th cactus variety of X is\nan analogue of secant variety and it is defined using linear spans of finite\nschemes of degree r. In this article we show that cactus varieties of\nsufficiently ample embeddings of X are set-theoretically defined by minors of\nmatrices with linear entries. The topic is closely related to conjectures of\nEisenbud-Koh-Stillman, which was proved by Ginensky in the case X a smooth\ncurve.

Recent advancements have seen\nthese systems incorporate increasingly large embedding tables, scaling up to\ntens of terabytes for industrial use. However, the expansion of network\nparameters in traditional recommendation models has plateaued at tens of\nmillions, limiting further benefits from increased embedding parameters.\nInspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), a new approach has\nemerged that scales network parameters using innovative structures, enabling\ncontinued performance improvements. A significant development in this area is\nMeta's generative recommendation model HSTU, which illustrates the scaling laws\nof recommendation systems by expanding parameters to thousands of billions.\nThis new paradigm has achieved substantial performance gains in online\nexperiments. In this paper, we aim to enhance the understanding of scaling laws\nby conducting comprehensive evaluations of large recommendation models.\nFirstly, we investigate the scaling laws across different backbone\narchitectures of the large recommendation models. Secondly, we conduct\ncomprehensive ablation studies to explore the origins of these scaling laws. We\nthen further assess the performance of HSTU, as the representative of large\nrecommendation models, on complex user behavior modeling tasks to evaluate its\napplicability. Notably, we also analyze its effectiveness in ranking tasks for\nthe first time. Finally, we offer insights into future directions for large\nrecommendation models.

      "title": "A Semi-Supervised Approach with Error Reflection for Echocardiography\n  Segmentation",
      "abstract": "Segmenting internal structure from echocardiography is essential for the\ndiagnosis and treatment of various heart diseases. Semi-supervised learning\nshows its ability in alleviating annotations scarcity. While existing\nsemi-supervised methods have been successful in image segmentation across\nvarious medical imaging modalities, few have attempted to design methods\nspecifically addressing the challenges posed by the poor contrast, blurred edge\ndetails and noise of echocardiography. These characteristics pose challenges to\nthe generation of high-quality pseudo-labels in semi-supervised segmentation\nbased on Mean Teacher. Inspired by human reflection on erroneous practices, we\ndevise an error reflection strategy for echocardiography semi-supervised\nsegmentation architecture. The process triggers the model to reflect on\ninaccuracies in unlabeled image segmentation, thereby enhancing the robustness\nof pseudo-label generation. Specifically, the strategy is divided into two\nsteps. The first step is called reconstruction reflection. The network is\ntasked with reconstructing authentic proxy images from the semantic masks of\nunlabeled images and their auxiliary sketches, while maximizing the structural\nsimilarity between the original inputs and the proxies. The second step is\ncalled guidance correction. Reconstruction error maps decouple unreliable\nsegmentation regions. Then, reliable data that are more likely to occur near\nhigh-density areas are leveraged to guide the optimization of unreliable data\npotentially located around decision boundaries. Additionally, we introduce an\neffective data augmentation strategy, termed as multi-scale mixing up strategy,\nto minimize the empirical distribution gap between labeled and unlabeled images\nand perceive diverse scales of cardiac anatomical structures. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "The bullwhip study has received a lot of attention in the literature, but\nwith conflicting results, especially in the context of data aggregation. In\nthis paper, we investigate three widely studied factors in bullwhip\nmeasurement: time aggregation, product aggregation, and seasonality. In time\naggregation, we decompose the variance into two components: the expectation of\nthe subset variances and the variance of subset expectations, thus decomposing\nthe bullwhip ratio into four components to explore the underlying mechanism of\ntime aggregation. In product aggregation, the bullwhip ratio is analyzed in the\ncontext of products with either uncorrelated or correlated demands and orders.\nSeasonality is also examined to study its effect on the bullwhip ratio. Our key\nfindings are: (a) Time aggregation can increase, decrease, or maintain the\nbullwhip ratio in different scenarios. (b) Aggregated bullwhip ratio of\nuncorrelated products is a weighted average of bullwhip ratios from individual\nproducts, with corresponding demand variance as the weights. However,\naggregated bullwhip ratio of correlated products could break the boundaries.\n(c) Seasonality can be considered as a standalone product with a bullwhip ratio\nof one, which can drive the overall bullwhip ratio closer to one.",

      "abstract": "Well log analysis is crucial for hydrocarbon exploration, providing detailed\ninsights into subsurface geological formations. However, gaps and inaccuracies\nin well log data, often due to equipment limitations, operational challenges,\nand harsh subsurface conditions, can introduce significant uncertainties in\nreservoir evaluation. Addressing these challenges requires effective methods\nfor both synthetic data generation and precise imputation of missing data,\nensuring data completeness and reliability. This study introduces a novel\nframework utilizing sequence-based generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nspecifically designed for well log data generation and imputation. The\nframework integrates two distinct sequence-based GAN models: Time Series GAN\n(TSGAN) for generating synthetic well log data and Sequence GAN (SeqGAN) for\nimputing missing data. Both models were tested on a dataset from the North Sea,\nNetherlands region, focusing on different sections of 5, 10, and 50 data\npoints. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves superior\naccuracy in filling data gaps compared to other deep learning models for\nspatial series analysis. The method yielded R^2 values of 0.921, 0.899, and\n0.594, with corresponding mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of\n8.320, 0.005, and 151.154, and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.012,\n0.005, and 0.032, respectively. These results set a new benchmark for data\nintegrity and utility in geosciences, particularly in well log data analysis.",

      "abstract": "Talking head video generation aims to generate a realistic talking head video\nthat preserves the person's identity from a source image and the motion from a\ndriving video. Despite the promising progress made in the field, it remains a\nchallenging and critical problem to generate videos with accurate poses and\nfine-grained facial details simultaneously. Essentially, facial motion is often\nhighly complex to model precisely, and the one-shot source face image cannot\nprovide sufficient appearance guidance during generation due to dynamic pose\nchanges. To tackle the problem, we propose to jointly learn motion and\nappearance codebooks and perform multi-scale codebook compensation to\neffectively refine both the facial motion conditions and appearance features\nfor talking face image decoding. Specifically, the designed multi-scale motion\nand appearance codebooks are learned simultaneously in a unified framework to\nstore representative global facial motion flow and appearance patterns. Then,\nwe present a novel multi-scale motion and appearance compensation module, which\nutilizes a transformer-based codebook retrieval strategy to query complementary\ninformation from the two codebooks for joint motion and appearance\ncompensation. The entire process produces motion flows of greater flexibility\nand appearance features with fewer distortions across different scales,\nresulting in a high-quality talking head video generation framework. Extensive\nexperiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach\nand demonstrate superior generation results from both qualitative and\nquantitative perspectives when compared to state-of-the-art competitors.",

The results\nindicate that the performance gap between DT and DM is affected by the complex\ninteraction of multiple factors, with the complexity of the action space and\nvisual complexity (particularly evaluated by compression ratio) being the\nprimary determining factors. DM performs well in environments with simple\naction and visual elements, while DT shows an advantage in games with higher\naction and visual complexity. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding\nof how the game characteristics affect the performance difference in sequential\nmodelling reinforcement learning, potentially guiding the development of future\nmodel design and applications for diverse and complex environments.",

Over the last decade, several papers have been written on\ngenerating documentation for source code using neural network architectures.\nWith the recent advancements in LLM technology, some open-source applications\nhave been developed to address this problem. However, these applications\ntypically rely on the OpenAI APIs, which incur substantial financial costs,\nparticularly for large repositories. Moreover, none of these open-source\napplications offer a fine-tuned model or features to enable users to fine-tune.\nAdditionally, finding suitable data for fine-tuning is often challenging.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language models like CLIP have been shown to be highly effective at\nlinking visual perception and natural language understanding, enabling\nsophisticated image-text capabilities, including strong retrieval and zero-shot\nclassification performance. Their widespread use, as well as the fact that CLIP\nmodels are trained on image-text pairs from the web, make them both a\nworthwhile and relatively easy target for backdoor attacks. As training\nfoundational models, such as CLIP, from scratch is very expensive, this paper\nfocuses on cleaning potentially poisoned models via fine-tuning. We first show\nthat existing cleaning techniques are not effective against simple structured\ntriggers used in Blended or BadNet backdoor attacks, exposing a critical\nvulnerability for potential real-world deployment of these models. Then, we\nintroduce PAR, Perturb and Recover, a surprisingly simple yet effective\nmechanism to remove backdoors from CLIP models. Through extensive experiments\nacross different encoders and types of backdoor attacks, we show that PAR\nachieves high backdoor removal rate while preserving good standard performance.\nFinally, we illustrate that our approach is effective even only with synthetic\ntext-image pairs, i.e. without access to real training data.

      "abstract": "Designing synthetic routes for novel molecules is pivotal in various fields\nlike medicine and chemistry. In this process, researchers need to explore a set\nof synthetic reactions to transform starting molecules into intermediates step\nby step until the target novel molecule is obtained. However, designing\nsynthetic routes presents challenges for researchers. First, researchers need\nto make decisions among numerous possible synthetic reactions at each step,\nconsidering various criteria (e.g., yield, experimental duration, and the count\nof experimental steps) to construct the synthetic route. Second, they must\nconsider the potential impact of one choice at each step on the overall\nsynthetic route. To address these challenges, we proposed SynthLens, a visual\nanalytics system to facilitate the iterative construction of synthetic routes\nby exploring multiple possibilities for synthetic reactions at each step of\nconstruction. Specifically, we have introduced a tree-form visualization in\nSynthLens to compare and evaluate all the explored routes at various\nexploration steps, considering both the exploration step and multiple criteria.\nOur system empowers researchers to consider their construction process\ncomprehensively, guiding them toward promising exploration directions to\ncomplete the synthetic route. We validated the usability and effectiveness of\nSynthLens through a quantitative evaluation and expert interviews, highlighting\nits role in facilitating the design process of synthetic routes. Finally, we\ndiscussed the insights of SynthLens to inspire other multi-criteria\ndecision-making scenarios with visual analytics.",

      "abstract": "Humans naturally interact with their 3D surroundings using language, and\nmodeling 3D language fields for scene understanding and interaction has gained\ngrowing interest. This paper introduces ChatSplat, a system that constructs a\n3D language field, enabling rich chat-based interaction within 3D space. Unlike\nexisting methods that primarily use CLIP-derived language features focused\nsolely on segmentation, ChatSplat facilitates interaction on three levels:\nobjects, views, and the entire 3D scene. For view-level interaction, we\ndesigned an encoder that encodes the rendered feature map of each view into\ntokens, which are then processed by a large language model (LLM) for\nconversation. At the scene level, ChatSplat combines multi-view tokens,\nenabling interactions that consider the entire scene. For object-level\ninteraction, ChatSplat uses a patch-wise language embedding, unlike LangSplat's\npixel-wise language embedding that implicitly includes mask and embedding.\nHere, we explicitly decouple the language embedding into separate mask and\nfeature map representations, allowing more flexible object-level interaction.\nTo address the challenge of learning 3D Gaussians posed by the complex and\ndiverse distribution of language embeddings used in the LLM, we introduce a\nlearnable normalization technique to standardize these embeddings, facilitating\neffective learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ChatSplat\nsupports multi-level interactions -- object, view, and scene -- within 3D\nspace, enhancing both understanding and engagement.",

However, the experimental realization of quantum devices\nis an active field of research with enormous open challenges, including\nrobustness against noise and scalability. While systems and control theory\nplays a crucial role in tackling these challenges, the principles of quantum\nphysics lead to a (perceived) high entry barrier for entering the field of\nquantum computing. This tutorial paper aims at lowering the barrier by\nintroducing basic concepts required to understand and solve research problems\nin quantum systems. First, we introduce fundamentals of quantum algorithms,\nranging from basic ingredients such as qubits and quantum logic gates to\nprominent examples and more advanced concepts, e.g., variational quantum\nalgorithms. Next, we formalize some engineering questions for building quantum\ndevices in the real world, which requires the careful manipulation of\nmicroscopic quantities obeying quantum effects. To this end for N-level\nsystems, we introduce basic concepts of (bilinear) quantum systems and control\ntheory including controllability, observability, and optimal control in a\nunified frame.

      "abstract": "Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) are investigated in biquadratic spin-$1$ XY\nchain with rhombic single-ion anisotropy by using the ground state energy (GE),\nthe bipartite entanglement entropy (BEE), and the mutual information (MI). It\nturns out that there are three spin nematic phases and two Tomonaga-Luttinger\n(TL) liquid phases with the central charge $c = 1$. The TL Liquid phases emerge\nroughly for biquadratic interaction strength two times stronger than the\nabsolute value of the single-ion anisotropy. The GE and the derivatives up to\nthe second order reveal a first-order QPT between spin nematic ferroquarupole\n(FQ) phases but cannot capture an evident signal of QPTs between the spin\nnematic phases and the TL Liquid phases as well as QPT between the two TL\nliquid phases. The TL liquid-to-liquid transition point features a highly\ndegenerate state and the spin-block entanglement entropy increases\nlogarithmically with block size. The BEE exhibits a divergent or convergent\nbehavior identifying the TL Liquid or spin nematic FQ phases, respectively.\nSimilarly, the MI and the spin-spin correlation are shown to decay\nalgebraically or exponentially with increasing the lattice distance in the TL\nLiquid or spin nematic FQ phases, respectively. In the TL liquid phase, the\nexponents $\\eta_I$ and $\\eta_z$ of the MI and the spin-spin correlation vary\nwith the interaction parameter of the biquadratic interaction strength and the\nrhombic single-ion anisotropy and satisfy the relationship of $\\eta_z <\\eta_I$.\nSuch changes of characteristic behavior of the BEE, the MI and the spin-spin\ncorrelation indicate an occurrence of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\n(BKT)-type QPT between the TL Liquid phase and the spin nematic FQ phase. The\nstaggered spin fluctuation $\\langle S^x S^y \\rangle$ is shown to play a\nsignificant role for the emergence of the TL liquid phase and thus give rise to\nthe BKT-type QPT.",

      "title": "Precise Facial Landmark Detection by Dynamic Semantic Aggregation\n  Transformer",
      "abstract": "At present, deep neural network methods have played a dominant role in face\nalignment field. However, they generally use predefined network structures to\npredict landmarks, which tends to learn general features and leads to mediocre\nperformance, e.g., they perform well on neutral samples but struggle with faces\nexhibiting large poses or occlusions. Moreover, they cannot effectively deal\nwith semantic gaps and ambiguities among features at different scales, which\nmay hinder them from learning efficient features. To address the above issues,\nin this paper, we propose a Dynamic Semantic-Aggregation Transformer (DSAT) for\nmore discriminative and representative feature (i.e., specialized feature)\nlearning. Specifically, a Dynamic Semantic-Aware (DSA) model is first proposed\nto partition samples into subsets and activate the specific pathways for them\nby estimating the semantic correlations of feature channels, making it possible\nto learn specialized features from each subset. Then, a novel Dynamic Semantic\nSpecialization (DSS) model is designed to mine the homogeneous information from\nfeatures at different scales for eliminating the semantic gap and ambiguities\nand enhancing the representation ability. Finally, by integrating the DSA model\nand DSS model into our proposed DSAT in both dynamic architecture and dynamic\nparameter manners, more specialized features can be learned for achieving more\nprecise face alignment. It is interesting to show that harder samples can be\nhandled by activating more feature channels. Extensive experiments on popular\nface alignment datasets demonstrate that our proposed DSAT outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in the literature.Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/GERMINO-LiuHe/DSAT.",

      "abstract": "Self-supervised heterogeneous graph learning (SHGL) has shown promising\npotential in diverse scenarios. However, while existing SHGL methods share a\nsimilar essential with clustering approaches, they encounter two significant\nlimitations: (i) noise in graph structures is often introduced during the\nmessage-passing process to weaken node representations, and (ii) cluster-level\ninformation may be inadequately captured and leveraged, diminishing the\nperformance in downstream tasks. In this paper, we address these limitations by\ntheoretically revisiting SHGL from the spectral clustering perspective and\nintroducing a novel framework enhanced by rank and dual consistency\nconstraints. Specifically, our framework incorporates a rank-constrained\nspectral clustering method that refines the affinity matrix to exclude noise\neffectively. Additionally, we integrate node-level and cluster-level\nconsistency constraints that concurrently capture invariant and clustering\ninformation to facilitate learning in downstream tasks. We theoretically\ndemonstrate that the learned representations are divided into distinct\npartitions based on the number of classes and exhibit enhanced generalization\nability across tasks. Experimental results affirm the superiority of our\nmethod, showcasing remarkable improvements in several downstream tasks compared\nto existing methods.",

We conduct close-coupling\ncalculations for $^7$Li-$^{41}$K collisions at ultracold limit to validate our\nproposal. The results show that the interference profile displayed in two-body\nloss rate is unable to be observed with unoptimized external field parameters.\nParticularly, our findings demonstrate that the two-body loss rate coefficient\nexhibits distinct constructive and destructive interference patterns near the\nmagnetically induced $p$-wave resonance in the incoming channel near which a\nrf-induced scattering resonance exists.

We design a goal-centered reward\nfunction to provide precise feedback to the drone agent, preventing targets\nfarther from the center of view from receiving higher rewards than closer ones.\nThis allows the drone to adapt to the diverse motion behavior of open-world\ntargets.

      "abstract": "Pre-trained large deep learning models are now serving as the dominant\ncomponent for downstream middleware users and have revolutionized the learning\nparadigm, replacing the traditional approach of training from scratch locally.\nTo reduce development costs, developers often integrate third-party pre-trained\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) into their intelligent software systems. However,\nutilizing untrusted DNNs presents significant security risks, as these models\nmay contain intentional backdoor defects resulting from the black-box training\nprocess. These backdoor defects can be activated by hidden triggers, allowing\nattackers to maliciously control the model and compromise the overall\nreliability of the intelligent software. To ensure the safe adoption of DNNs in\ncritical software systems, it is crucial to establish a backdoor defect\ndatabase for localization studies. This paper addresses this research gap by\nintroducing BDefects4NN, the first backdoor defect database, which provides\nlabeled backdoor-defected DNNs at the neuron granularity and enables controlled\nlocalization studies of defect root causes. In BDefects4NN, we define three\ndefect injection rules and employ four representative backdoor attacks across\nfour popular network architectures and three widely adopted datasets, yielding\na comprehensive database of 1,654 backdoor-defected DNNs with four defect\nquantities and varying infected neurons. Based on BDefects4NN, we conduct\nextensive experiments on evaluating six fault localization criteria and two\ndefect repair techniques, which show limited effectiveness for backdoor\ndefects. Additionally, we investigate backdoor-defected models in practical\nscenarios, specifically in lane detection for autonomous driving and large\nlanguage models (LLMs), revealing potential threats and highlighting current\nlimitations in precise defect localization.",

To address this problem, in this paper, we proposed MERLIN a\nmulti-stage query performance prediction method for high-performance OLAP\nDBMSs. MERLIN first establishes resource cost models for each physical\noperator. Then, it constructs a DAG that consists of a data-flow tree backbone\nand resource competition relationships among concurrent operators.

Traditionally, cognition was believed to be exclusive to humans and\na result of brain activity. However, recent studies reveal it as a fundamental\ncharacteristic of all life forms, ranging from single cells to complex\nmulticellular organisms and their networks. Yet, the literature and general\nunderstanding of cognition still largely remain human-brain-focused, leading to\nconceptual gaps and incoherency. This paper presents a variety of computational\n(information processing) approaches, including an info-computational approach\nto cognition, where natural structures represent information and dynamical\nprocesses on natural structures are regarded as computation, relative to an\nobserving cognizing agent. We model cognition as a web of concurrent\nmorphological computations, driven by processes of self-assembly,\nself-organisation, and autopoiesis across physical, chemical, and biological\ndomains. We examine recent findings linking morphological computation,\nmorphogenesis, agency, basal cognition, extended evolutionary synthesis, and\nactive inference. We establish a connection to Magnanis Eco-Cognitive\nComputationalism and the idea of computational domestication of ignorant\nentities. Novel theoretical and applied insights question the boundaries of\nconventional computational models of cognition. The traditional models\nprioritize symbolic processing and often neglect the inherent constraints and\npotentialities in the physical embodiment of agents on different levels of\norganization. Gaining a better info-computational grasp of cognitive embodiment\nis crucial for the advancement of fields such as biology, evolutionary studies,\nartificial intelligence, robotics, medicine, and more.",

      "abstract": "We present an analysis of the structure, kinematics, and chemo-dynamical\nproperties of the Milky Way bulge using data from OGLE, APOGEE, and Gaia.\nFirstly, we identified 2,156 ab-type RR Lyrae stars (RRabs) from OGLE-IV, then\nthrough their apocenters derived from orbital integration, we distinguished\nthree populations: the central bulge RRabs, the inner bulge RRabs and halo\ninterlopers. Inner bulge RRabs kinematically align with the Galactic bar, while\ncentral bulge RRabs show slower rotation with lower velocity dispersion, which\ndo not trace the bar. Higher velocity dispersion stars were identified as halo\ninterlopers. Then, orbital analysis of 28,188 APOGEE Red Clump and Red Giant\nBranch stars revealed kinematic properties consistent with RRabs, and chemical\nabundance distribution displayed a bimodal stellar density pattern, suggesting\ncomplex star evolution histories and also slightly different star formation\nhistories for the inner bulge and central bulge. The differences in the density\ndistribution on the $|\\mathrm{Z}|_{\\text{max}}$-eccentricity plane for the\ncentral bulge, inner bulge, and halo regions are clearly detected. Finally, the\nchemodynamical analysis of 301,485 Gaia DR3 red giants without orbital\nintegration indicated that metal-rich bulge stars form a bar-like structure,\nwhile metal-poor bulge stars are dominated by velocity dispersion. It is found\nthat the classification of bulge stars based on orbital parameters, rather than\nsolely on metallicity, provides a more accurate population separation. Our\nresults also support that secular evolution of the Galactic disk is the primary\norigin of the bulge, and boxy/peanut (B-P) bulge population might be more\ndominant than X-shape bulge population.",

For a model forecast to be useful to inform\ndecision-makers, model validation and verification determine adequateness.

While verification\nof meteorological models follows strict criteria with established metrics and\nforecast horizons, assessments of ecological forecasting models still remain\nexperiment-specific and forecast horizons are rarely reported. As such, users\nof ecological forecasts remain uninformed of how far into the future statements\ncan be trusted. In this work, we synthesise existing approaches, define\nempirical forecast horizons in a unified framework for assessing ecological\npredictability and offer recipes on their computation. We distinguish upper and\nlower boundary estimates of predictability limits, reflecting the model's\npotential and actual forecast horizon, and show how a benchmark model can help\ndetermine its relative forecast horizon.

By\nintegrating this into a generative model, the generative neural radiance field\n(GRAF) is capable of producing images from random noise z without 3D\nsupervision. In practice, the shape and appearance are modeled by z_s and z_a,\nrespectively, to manipulate them separately during inference. However, it is\nchallenging to represent multiple scenes using a solitary MLP and precisely\ncontrol the generation of 3D geometry in terms of shape and appearance.

Consequently, we manipulated the shape and appearance codes to realize\nthe controllable generation of high-fidelity images with 3D consistency.\nMoreover, the model enables the synthesis of novel views that do not exist in\nthe training sets via camera pose alteration and feature interpolation.\nExtensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate its superiority in 3D-aware\nimage generation compared to its counterparts.",

Motivated by the\nrecently discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we derive a generic\neffective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet\nlocal moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Because of the strong spin-orbit\ncoupling, the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model on both\nintra- and inter-dimer bonds. We focus on the dimer phase and show that, in\naddition to the conventional \"singlet\" dimer phase in the Heisenberg limit,\npeculiar \"triplet\" dimer phases can be stabilized by the strong spin-orbit\ncoupling. While the \"singlet\" dimer phase, at certain conditions, could still\nexhibit exact solvability and nearly flat excitations analogous to that in the\nisotropic Heisenberg model, these \"triplet\" dimer phases are generally not\nexactly solvable and exhibit stronger dispersive excitations. We further\ndiscuss the thermodynamical and spectral signatures of these \"triplet\" dimer\nphases that can be experimentally probed, and illustrate that the recently\ndiscovered Shastry-Sutherland magnet Yb$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$ hosts a triplet\ndimer ground state.",
