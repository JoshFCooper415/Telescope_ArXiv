      "title": "Enhanced ultraviolet absorption in BN monolayers caused by tunable\n  buckling",
      "abstract": "The optical properties of a hexagonal Boron Nitride (BN) monolayer across the\nUV spectrum are studied by tuning its planar buckling. The strong\n$\\sigma\\text{-}\\sigma$ bond through sp$^2$ hybridization of a flat BN monolayer\ncan be changed to a stronger $\\sigma\\text{-}\\pi$ bond through sp$^3$\nhybridization by increasing the planar buckling. This gives rise to the $s$-\nand $p$-orbital contributions to form a density of states around the Fermi\nenergy, and these states dislocate to a lower energy in the presence of an\nincreased planar buckling. Consequently, the wide band gap of a flat BN\nmonolayer is reduced to a smaller band gap in a buckled BN monolayer enhancing\nits optical activity in the Deep-UV region. The optical properties such as the\ndielectric function, the reflectivity, the absorption, and the optical\nconductivity spectra are investigated. It is shown that the absorption rate can\nbe enhanced by $(12\\text{-}15)\\%$ for intermediate values of planar buckling in\nthe Deep-UV region, and $(15\\text{-}20)\\%$ at higher values of planar buckling\nin the near-UV region. Furthermore, the optical conductivity is enhanced by\nincreased planar buckling in both the visible and the Deep-UV regions depending\non the direction of the polarization of the incoming light. Our results may be\nuseful for optoelectronic BN monolayer devices in the UV range including UV\nspectroscopy, deep-UV communications, and UV photodetectors.",

      "title": "Usability and Aesthetics: Better Together for Automated Repair of Web\n  Pages",
      "abstract": "With the recent explosive growth of mobile devices such as smartphones or\ntablets, guaranteeing consistent web appearance across all environments has\nbecome a significant problem. This happens simply because it is hard to keep\ntrack of the web appearance on different sizes and types of devices that render\nthe web pages. Therefore, fixing the inconsistent appearance of web pages can\nbe difficult, and the cost incurred can be huge, e.g., poor user experience and\nfinancial loss due to it. Recently, automated web repair techniques have been\nproposed to automatically resolve inconsistent web page appearance, focusing on\nimproving usability. However, generated patches tend to disrupt the webpage's\nlayout, rendering the repaired webpage aesthetically unpleasing, e.g.,\ndistorted images or misalignment of components.\n  In this paper, we propose an automated repair approach for web pages based on\nmeta-heuristic algorithms that can assure both usability and aesthetics. The\nkey novelty that empowers our approach is a novel fitness function that allows\nus to optimistically evolve buggy web pages to find the best solution that\noptimizes both usability and aesthetics at the same time. Empirical evaluations\nshow that our approach is able to successfully resolve mobile-friendly problems\nin 94% of the evaluation subjects, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art\nbaseline techniques in terms of both usability and aesthetics.",

      "title": "Bird Species Classification And Acoustic Features Selection Based on\n  Distributed Neural Network with Two Stage Windowing of Short-Term Features",
      "abstract": "Identification of bird species from audio records is one of the challenging\ntasks due to the existence of multiple species in the same recording, noise in\nthe background, and long-term recording. Besides, choosing a proper acoustic\nfeature from audio recording for bird species classification is another\nproblem. In this paper, a hybrid method is represented comprising both\ntraditional signal processing and a deep learning-based approach to classify\nbird species from audio recordings of diverse sources and types. Besides, a\ndetailed study with 34 different features helps to select the proper feature\nset for classification and analysis in real-time applications. Moreover, the\nproposed deep neural network uses both acoustic and temporal feature learning.\nThe proposed method starts with detecting voice activity from the raw signal,\nfollowed by extracting short-term features from the processed recording using\n50 ms (with 25ms overlapping) time windows. Later, the short-term features are\nreshaped using second stage (non-overlapping) windowing to be trained through a\ndistributed 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that forwards the output\nfeatures to a Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network. Then a final dense\nlayer classifies the bird species. For the 10 class classifier, the highest\naccuracy achieved was 90.45\\% for a feature set consisting of 13 Mel Frequency\nCepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and 12 Chroma Vectors. The corresponding\nspecificity and AUC scores are 98.94\\% and 94.09\\%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "In the last decades, scene text recognition has gained worldwide attention\nfrom both the academic community and actual users due to its importance in a\nwide range of applications. Despite achievements in optical character\nrecognition, scene text recognition remains challenging due to inherent\nproblems such as distortions or irregular layout. Most of the existing\napproaches mainly leverage recurrence or convolution-based neural networks.\nHowever, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) usually suffer from slow\ntraining speed due to sequential computation and encounter problems as\nvanishing gradient or bottleneck, CNN endures a trade-off between complexity\nand performance. In this paper, we introduce SAFL, a self-attention-based\nneural network model with the focal loss for scene text recognition, to\novercome the limitation of the existing approaches. The use of focal loss\ninstead of negative log-likelihood helps the model focus more on low-frequency\nsamples training. Moreover, to deal with the distortions and irregular texts,\nwe exploit Spatial TransformerNetwork (STN) to rectify text before passing to\nthe recognition network. We perform experiments to compare the performance of\nthe proposed model with seven benchmarks. The numerical results show that our\nmodel achieves the best performance.",

      "abstract": "Let $G$ be a connected reductive group acting on a complex vector space $V$\nand projective space ${\\mathbb P}V$. Let $x\\in V$ and ${\\cal H}\\subseteq {\\cal\nG}$ be the Lie algebra of its stabilizer. Our objective is to understand points\n$[y]$, and their stabilizers which occur in the vicinity of $[x]$. We construct\nan explicit ${\\cal G}$-action on a suitable neighbourhood of $x$, which we call\nthe local model at $x$. We show that Lie algebras of stabilizers of points in\nthe vicinity of $x$ are parameterized by subspaces of ${\\cal H}$. When ${\\cal\nH}$ is reductive these are Lie subalgebras of ${\\cal H}$. If the orbit of $x$\nis closed this also follows from Luna's theorem. Our construction involves a\nmap connected to the local curvature form at $x$. We apply the local model to\nforms, when the form $g$ is obtained from the form $f$ as the leading term of a\none parameter family acting on $f$. We show that there is a flattening ${\\cal\nK}_0$ of ${\\cal K}$, the stabilizer of $f$ which sits as a subalgebra of ${\\cal\nH}$, the stabilizer $g$. We specialize to the case of forms $f$ whose\n$SL(X)$-orbits are affine, and the orbit of $g$ is of co-dimension $1$. We show\nthat (i) either ${\\cal H}$ has a very simple structure, or (ii) conjugates of\nthe elements of ${\\cal K}$ also stabilize $g$ and the tangent of exit. Next, we\napply this to the adjoint action. We show that for a general matrix $X$, the\nsignatures of nilpotent matrices in its projective orbit closure (under\nconjugation) are determined by the multiplicity data of the spectrum of $X$.\nFinally, we formulate the path problem of finding paths with specific\nproperties from $y$ to its limit points $x$ as an optimization problem using\nlocal differential geometry.

      "abstract": "Commonsense question answering (CQA) aims to test if models can answer\nquestions regarding commonsense knowledge that everyone knows. Prior works that\nincorporate external knowledge bases have shown promising results, but\nknowledge bases are expensive to construct and are often limited to a fixed set\nof relations. In this paper, we instead focus on better utilizing the\n\\textit{implicit knowledge} stored in pre-trained language models. While\nresearchers have found that the knowledge embedded in pre-trained language\nmodels can be extracted by having them fill in the blanks of carefully designed\nprompts for relation extraction and text classification, it remains unclear if\nwe can adopt this paradigm in CQA where the inputs and outputs take much more\nflexible forms. To this end, we investigate four translation methods that can\ntranslate natural questions into cloze-style sentences to better solicit\ncommonsense knowledge from language models, including a syntactic-based model,\nan unsupervised neural model, and two supervised neural models. In addition, to\ncombine the different translation methods, we propose to encourage consistency\namong model predictions on different translated questions with unlabeled data.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on three CQA datasets in\nzero-shot settings. We show that our methods are complementary to a knowledge\nbase improved model, and combining them can lead to state-of-the-art zero-shot\nperformance. Analyses also reveal distinct characteristics of the different\ncloze translation methods and provide insights on why combining them can lead\nto great improvements.",

While this alleviates the impact of unfair\nrecommendations, the expected return of an approach may significantly\ncompromise the recommendation accuracy due to the inherent trade-off between\nfairness and utility. This motivates us to deal with these conflicting\nobjectives and explore the optimal trade-off between them in recommendation.\nOne conspicuous approach is to seek a Pareto efficient solution to guarantee\noptimal compromises between utility and fairness. Moreover, considering the\nneeds of real-world e-commerce platforms, it would be more desirable if we can\ngeneralize the whole Pareto Frontier, so that the decision-makers can specify\nany preference of one objective over another based on their current business\nneeds. Therefore, in this work, we propose a fairness-aware recommendation\nframework using multi-objective reinforcement learning, called MoFIR, which is\nable to learn a single parametric representation for optimal recommendation\npolicies over the space of all possible preferences. Specially, we modify\ntraditional DDPG by introducing conditioned network into it, which conditions\nthe networks directly on these preferences and outputs Q-value-vectors.\nExperiments on several real-world recommendation datasets verify the\nsuperiority of our framework on both fairness metrics and recommendation\nmeasures when compared with all other baselines. We also extract the\napproximate Pareto Frontier on real-world datasets generated by MoFIR and\ncompare to state-of-the-art fairness methods.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this work is to formulate two new solutions by decoupling the\nfield equations via a minimal geometric deformation in the context of\nself-interacting Brans-Dicke gravity. We introduce an extra source in the\nanisotropic fluid distribution to generate new analogs of existing solutions.\nThe radial metric function is transformed to decouple the field equations into\ntwo sets such that each array corresponds to one source only. The system\ncorresponding to the original matter distribution is specified by metric\nfunctions of well-behaved solutions. On the other hand, the second set is\nclosed by imposing constraints on the additional matter source. For this\npurpose, we have applied the isotropization condition as well as vanishing\ncomplexity condition on the new source. Smooth matching of interior and\nexterior spacetimes at the junction provides values of the unknown constants.\nInteresting physical features of corresponding models are checked by employing\nthe mass and radius of the star PSR J1614-2230. It is concluded that both\nextensions yield viable and stable models for certain values of the decoupling\nparameter.",

      "title": "Impact of Evolving Protocols and COVID-19 on Internet Traffic Shares",
      "abstract": "The rapid deployment of new Internet protocols over the last few years and\nthe COVID-19 pandemic more recently (2020) has resulted in a change in the\nInternet traffic composition. Consequently, an updated microscopic view of\ntraffic shares is needed to understand how the Internet is evolving to capture\nboth such shorter- and longer-term events. Toward this end, we observe traffic\ncomposition at a research network in Japan and a Tier-1 ISP in the USA. We\nanalyze the traffic traces passively captured at two inter-domain links: MAWI\n(Japan) and CAIDA (New York-Sao Paulo), which cover 100GB of data for MAWI\ntraces and 4TB of data for CAIDA traces in total. We begin by studying the\nimpact of COVID-19 on the MAWI link: We find a substantial increase in the\ntraffic volume of OpenVPN and rsync, as well as increases in traffic volume\nfrom cloud storage and video conferencing services, which shows that clients\nshift to remote work during the pandemic. For traffic traces between March 2018\nto December 2018, we find that the use of IPv6 is increasing quickly on the\nCAIDA monitor: The IPv6 traffic volume increases from 1.1% in March 2018 to\n6.1% in December 2018, while the IPv6 traffic share remains stable in the MAWI\ndataset at around 9% of the traffic volume. Among other protocols at the\napplication layer, 60%-70% of IPv4 traffic on the CAIDA link is HTTP(S)\ntraffic, out of which two-thirds are encrypted; for the MAWI link, more than\n90% of the traffic is Web, of which nearly 75% is encrypted. Compared to\nprevious studies, this depicts a larger increase in encrypted Web traffic of up\nto a 3-to-1 ratio of HTTPS to HTTP. As such, our observations in this study\nfurther reconfirm that traffic shares change with time and can vary greatly\ndepending on the vantage point studied despite the use of the same generalized\nmethodology and analyses, which can also be applied to other traffic monitoring\ndatasets.",

      "abstract": "Bayesian Optimization algorithm has become a promising approach for nonlinear\nglobal optimization problems and many machine learning applications. Over the\npast few years, improvements and enhancements have been brought forward and\nthey have shown some promising results in solving the complex dynamic problems,\nsystems of ordinary differential equations where the objective functions are\ncomputationally expensive to evaluate. Besides, the straightforward\nimplementation of the Bayesian Optimization algorithm performs well merely for\noptimization problems with 10-20 dimensions. The study presented in this paper\nproposes a new high dimensional Bayesian Optimization algorithm combining\nRecurrent neural networks, which is expected to predict the optimal solution\nfor the global optimization problems with high dimensional or time series\ndecision models. The proposed RNN-BO algorithm can solve the optimal control\nproblems in the lower dimension space and then learn from the historical data\nusing the recurrent neural network to learn the historical optimal solution\ndata and predict the optimal control strategy for any new initial system value\nsetting. In addition, accurately and quickly providing the optimal control\nstrategy is essential to effectively and efficiently control the epidemic\nspread while minimizing the associated financial costs. Therefore, to verify\nthe effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments are\ncarried out on a deterministic SEIR epidemic model and a stochastic SIS optimal\ncontrol model. Finally, we also discuss the impacts of different numbers of the\nRNN layers and training epochs on the trade-off between solution quality and\nrelated computational efforts.",

      "abstract": "It is well-known that deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown remarkable\nsuccess in many fields. However, when adding an imperceptible magnitude\nperturbation on the model input, the model performance might get rapid\ndecrease. To address this issue, a randomness technique has been proposed\nrecently, named Stochastic Neural Networks (SNNs). Specifically, SNNs inject\nrandomness into the model to defend against unseen attacks and improve the\nadversarial robustness. However, existed studies on SNNs mainly focus on\ninjecting fixed or learnable noises to model weights/activations. In this\npaper, we find that the existed SNNs performances are largely bottlenecked by\nthe feature representation ability. Surprisingly, simply maximizing the\nvariance per dimension of the feature distribution leads to a considerable\nboost beyond all previous methods, which we named maximize feature distribution\nvariance stochastic neural network (MFDV-SNN). Extensive experiments on\nwell-known white- and black-box attacks show that MFDV-SNN achieves a\nsignificant improvement over existing methods, which indicates that it is a\nsimple but effective method to improve model robustness.",

Although\nend-to-end fully convolutional designs have recently advanced the\nstate-of-the-art in non-uniform motion deblurring, their performance-complexity\ntrade-off is still sub-optimal. Existing approaches achieve a large receptive\nfield by a simple increment in the number of generic convolution layers,\nkernel-size, which comes with the burden of the increase in model size and\ninference speed. In this work, we propose an efficient pixel adaptive and\nfeature attentive design for handling large blur variations within and across\ndifferent images.

When the order of the Riesz\npotential $\\alpha$ is equal to the Euclidean dimension $N$, and thus it is a\nlogarithm, the system turns out to be equivalent to a nonlocal Choquard type\nequation. On the one hand, the natural function space setting in which the\nSchr\\\"odinger energy is well defined is the Sobolev limiting space\n$W^{1,N}(\\mathbb{R}^N)$, where the maximal nonlinear growth is of exponential\ntype. On the other hand, in order to have the nonlocal energy well defined and\nprove the existence of finite energy solutions, we introduce a suitable\n$log$-weighted variant of the Pohozaev-Trudinger inequality which provides a\nproper functional framework where we use variational methods.",

Obtaining the driving field that transforms the quantum\nsystems to its objective is a typical control task. This task is hard, scaling\nunfavorably with the size of Hilbert space. To tackle this issue we employ\ntypicality to assist in finding the control field for such systems. To\ndemonstrate the method we choose the control task of cooling the fine structure\nstates of the AlF molecule, from relatively high temperatures which results in\nlarge Hilbert space. Using quantum typicality, we demonstrate that we can\nsimulate an ensemble of states, enabling a control task addressing\nsimultaneously many states.

By employing the World Bank's\ndata on population size and Gini coefficient from sixty-nine countries in 2012,\nthis study finds that the relationship between Gini coefficient and natural\nlogarithm of population size is nonlinear in the form of a second-degree\npolynomial function. The estimated results using regression analysis show that\nthe majority of countries in the sample have Gini coefficients either too high\nor too low compared to their appropriate values.

In this\npaper we discuss the concept of confusing words in adversarial samples.\nConfusing words are commonly encountered, which are various kinds of words that\nsound similar to the predefined keywords. To enhance the wake word detection\nsystem's robustness against confusing words, we propose several methods to\ngenerate the adversarial confusing samples for simulating real confusing words\nscenarios in which we usually do not have any real confusing samples in the\ntraining set. The generated samples include concatenated audio, synthesized\ndata, and partially masked keywords. Moreover, we use a domain embedding\nconcatenated system to improve the performance. Experimental results show that\nthe adversarial samples generated in our approach help improve the system's\nrobustness in both the common scenario and the confusing words scenario.

      "abstract": "In the present study we have investigated the structural properties,\nelectronic band dispersion, elastic constants, acoustic behavior, phonon\nspectrum, optical properties, and a number of thermophysical parameters of\nbinary topological semimetal BaGa2 in details via first-principles calculations\nusing the density functional theory (DFT) based formalisms. The electronic band\nstructure and density of states calculations with spin orbit coupling reveal\nsemimetallic nature with clear topological signature. The minimum thermal\nconductivities and anisotropies of the compound are calculated. The elastic\nconstants, phonon dispersion calculations show that the compound under study is\nboth mechanically and dynamically stable. Comprehensive study of elastic\nconstants and moduli shows that BaGa2 possesses fairly isotropic mechanical\nproperties, reasonably good machinability, low Debye temperature and melting\npoint. The chemical bonding in BaG2 is interpreted via the electronic energy\ndensity of states, electron density distribution, elastic properties and\nMulliken bond population analysis. The compound possesses both ionic and\ncovalent bondings. The reflectivity spectra show strong anisotropy with respect\nto polarization of the incident electric field in the visible to\nmid-ultraviolet regions. High reflectivity over wide spectral range makes BaGa2\nsuitable as a reflecting material. BaGa2 is also an efficient absorber of\nultraviolet radiation. Furthermore, the refractive index is quite high in the\ninfrared to visible range. All the energy dependent optical parameters show\nmetallic features and are in complete accord with the underlying bulk\nelectronic density of states calculations. Most of the results presented in\nthis study are novel and should serve as useful reference for future study.",

      "abstract": "Image inpainting methods have shown significant improvements by using deep\nneural networks recently. However, many of these techniques often create\ndistorted structures or blurry textures inconsistent with surrounding areas.\nThe problem is rooted in the encoder layers' ineffectiveness in building a\ncomplete and faithful embedding of the missing regions. To address this\nproblem, two-stage approaches deploy two separate networks for a coarse and\nfine estimate of the inpainted image. Some approaches utilize handcrafted\nfeatures like edges or contours to guide the reconstruction process. These\nmethods suffer from huge computational overheads owing to multiple generator\nnetworks, limited ability of handcrafted features, and sub-optimal utilization\nof the information present in the ground truth. Motivated by these\nobservations, we propose a distillation based approach for inpainting, where we\nprovide direct feature level supervision for the encoder layers in an adaptive\nmanner. We deploy cross and self distillation techniques and discuss the need\nfor a dedicated completion-block in encoder to achieve the distillation target.\nWe conduct extensive evaluations on multiple datasets to validate our method.",

      "abstract": "Synchronous reactive data flow is a paradigm that provides a high-level\nabstract programming model for embedded and cyber-physical systems, including\nthe locally synchronous components of IoT systems. Security in such systems is\nseverely compromised due to low-level programming, ill-defined interfaces and\ninattention to security classification of data. By incorporating a\nDenning-style lattice-based secure information flow framework into a\nsynchronous reactive data flow language, we provide a framework in which\ncorrect-and-secure-by-construction implementations for such systems may be\nspecified and derived. In particular, we propose an extension of the Lustre\nprogramming framework with a security type system. The novelty of our type\nsystem lies in a symbolic formulation of constraints over security type\nvariables, in particular the treatment of node calls, which allows us to reason\nabout secure flow with respect to any security class lattice. The main theorem\nis the soundness of our type system with respect to the co-inductive\noperational semantics of Lustre, which we prove by showing that well-typed\nprograms exhibit non-interference. Rather than tackle the full language, we\nfirst prove the non-interference result for a well-behaved sub-language called\n\"Normalised Lustre\" (NLustre), for which our type system is far simpler. We\nthen show that Bourke et al.'s semantics-preserving \"normalisation\"\ntransformations from Lustre to NLustre are security-preserving as well. This\npreservation of security types by the normalisation transformations is a\nproperty akin to \"subject reduction\" but at the level of compiler\ntransformations. The main result that well-security-typed Lustre programs are\nnon-interfering follows from a reduction to our earlier result of\nnon-interference for NLustre via the semantics-preservation (of Bourke et al.)\nand type preservation results.",

We decompose the restoration\ntask into two stages of degradation localization and degraded region-guided\nrestoration, unlike existing methods which directly learn a mapping between the\ndegraded and clean images. Our premise is to use the auxiliary task of\ndegradation mask prediction to guide the restoration process. We demonstrate\nthat the model trained for this auxiliary task contains vital region knowledge,\nwhich can be exploited to guide the restoration network's training using\nattentive knowledge distillation technique.

As an analogy to code\ncoverage metrics for testing conventional software, researchers have proposed\nneuron coverage metrics and coverage-driven methods to generate DNN test cases.\nHowever, Yan et al. doubt the usefulness of existing coverage criteria in DNN\ntesting. They show that a coverage-driven method is less effective than a\ngradient-based method in terms of both uncovering defects and improving model\nrobustness.\n  In this paper, we conduct a replication study of the work by Yan et al. and\nextend the experiments for deeper analysis. A larger model and a dataset of\nhigher resolution images are included to examine the generalizability of the\nresults. We also extend the experiments with more test case generation\ntechniques and adjust the process of improving model robustness to be closer to\nthe practical life cycle of DNN development. Our experiment results confirm the\nconclusion from Yan et al. that coverage-driven methods are less effective than\ngradient-based methods. Yan et al. find that using gradient-based methods to\nretrain cannot repair defects uncovered by coverage-driven methods. They\nattribute this to the fact that the two types of methods use different\nperturbation strategies: gradient-based methods perform differentiable\ntransformations while coverage-driven methods can perform additional\nnon-differentiable transformations. We test several hypotheses and further show\nthat even coverage-driven methods are constrained only to perform\ndifferentiable transformations, the uncovered defects still cannot be repaired\nby adversarial training with gradient-based methods. Thus, defensive strategies\nfor coverage-driven methods should be further studied.",

The difficulty of generating optimized tensor codes\ndrives DL compiler to ask for the auto-tuning approaches, and the increasing\ndemands require increasing auto-tuning efficiency and quality. Currently, the\nDL compilers partition the input DL models into several subgraphs and leverage\nthe auto-tuning to find the optimal tensor codes of these subgraphs. However,\nexisting auto-tuning approaches usually regard subgraphs as individual ones and\noverlook the similarities across them, and thus fail to exploit better tensor\ncodes under limited time budgets. We propose FamilySeer, an auto-tuning\nframework for DL compilers that can generate better tensor codes even with\nlimited time budgets. FamilySeer exploits the similarities and differences\namong subgraphs can organize them into subgraph families, where the tuning of\none subgraph can also improve other subgraphs within the same family. The cost\nmodel of each family gets more purified training samples generated by the\nfamily and becomes more accurate so that the costly measurements on real\nhardware can be replaced with the lightweight estimation through cost model.\nOur experiments show that FamilySeer can generate model codes with the same\ncode performance more efficiently than state-of-the-art auto-tuning frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Phylogenetic comparative methods are new in our field and are shrouded, for\nmost linguists, in at least a little mystery. Yet the path that led to their\ndiscovery in comparative biology is so similar to the methodological history of\nbalanced sampling, that it is only an accident of history that they were not\ndiscovered by a typologist. Here we clarify the essential logic behind\nphylogenetic comparative methods and their fundamental relatedness to a deep\nintellectual tradition focussed on sampling. Then we introduce concepts,\nmethods and tools which will enable typologists to use these methods in\neveryday typological research. The key commonality of phylogenetic comparative\nmethods and balanced sampling is that they attempt to deal with statistical\nnon-independence due to genealogy. Whereas sampling can never achieve\nindependence and requires most comparative data to be discarded, phylogenetic\ncomparative methods achieve independence while retaining and using all data. We\ndiscuss the essential notions of phylogenetic signal; uncertainty about trees;\ntypological averages and proportions that are sensitive to genealogy;\ncomparison across language families; and the effects of areality. Extensive\nsupplementary materials illustrate computational tools for practical analysis\nand we illustrate the methods discussed with a typological case study of the\nlaminal contrast in Pama-Nyungan.",

      "abstract": "Intraplate volcanic islands are often considered as stable relief with\nconstant vertical motion and used for relative sea-level curves reconstruction.\nThis study shows that large landslides cause non-negligible isostatic\nadjustment. The vertical motion that occurred after landslide is quantified\nusing a modelling approach.

In Tahiti, a change in the subsidence rate of 0.1\nmm/yr (from 0.25 mm/yr to 0.15 mm/yr) occurred during the last 6 kyr and could\nbe explained by a landslide involving a minimum volume of 0.2 $km^3$, $6 \\pm 1$\nkyr ago.",

      "abstract": "Pieces of empirical evidence suggest the existence of a period-age relation\nfor long-period variables (LPVs). Yet, this property has hardly been studied on\ntheoretical grounds thus far. We aim to examine the period-age relation using\nthe results from recent nonlinear pulsation calculations. We combined isochrone\nmodels with theoretical periods to simulate the distribution of fundamental\nmode LPV pulsators, which include Miras, in the period-age plane, and we\ncompared it with observations of LPVs in Galactic and Magellanic Clouds'\nclusters. In agreement with observations, models predict that the fundamental\nmode period decreases with increasing age because of the dominant role of mass\nin shaping stellar structure and evolution. At a given age, the period\ndistribution shows a non-negligible width and is skewed toward short periods,\nexcept for young C-rich stars. As a result, the period-age relations of O-rich\nand C-rich models are predicted to have different slopes. We derived best-fit\nrelations describing age and initial mass as a function of the fundamental mode\nperiod for both O- and C-rich models. The study confirms the power of the\nperiod-age relations to study populations of LPVs of specific types, either\nO-rich or C-rich, on statistical grounds. In doing so, it is recommended not to\nlimit a study to Miras, which would make it prone to selection biases, but\nrather to include semi-regular variables that pulsate predominantly in the\nfundamental mode. The use of the relations to study individual LPVs, on the\nother hand, requires more care given the scatter in the period distribution\npredicted at any given age.",

      "abstract": "Our universe was born about 13.8 billion years ago from an extremely hot and\ndense singular point, in a process known as the Big Bang. The hot and dense\nmatter which dominated the system within a few microseconds of its birth was in\nthe form of a soup of elementary quarks and gluons, known as the quark-gluon\nplasma (QGP). Signatures compatible with the formation of the QGP matter have\nexperimentally been observed in heavy-ion (such as Au or Pb) collisions at\nultra-relativistic energies. Recently, experimental data of proton-proton (pp)\ncollisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have also shown signals\nresembling those of the QGP formation, which made these studies quite\nstimulating as to how the collision of small systems features in producing the\nearly universe signals. In this article, we report on some of the compelling\nexperimental results and give an account of the present understanding. We\nreview the pp physics program at the LHC and discuss future prospects in the\ncontext of exploring the nature of the primordial matter in the early universe.",

Reinforcement learning has become a powerful tool to\nformulate controllers for legged robots. Learning multiple gaits and\ntransitions, nevertheless, is related to the multi-task learning problems. In\nthis work, we present a novel framework for training a simple control policy\nfor a quadruped robot to locomote in various gaits. Four independent phases are\nused as the interface between the gait generator and the control policy, which\ncharacterizes the movement of four feet. Guided by the phases, the quadruped\nrobot is able to locomote according to the generated gaits, such as walk, trot,\npacing and bounding, and to make transitions among those gaits. More general\nphases can be used to generate complex gaits, such as mixed rhythmic dancing.\nWith the control policy, the Black Panther robot, a medium-dog-sized quadruped\nrobot, can perform all learned motor skills while following the velocity\ncommands smoothly and robustly in natural environment.",

In this study, specific indicators were\ndeveloped to analyze resilience, and the trajectories of resilience were\ncompared. Energy production is relevant for describing variations in social and\neconomic activities. This indicator was applied to a case study of a natural\ndisaster, that is Hurricane Irma in 2017. The hurricane caused fatalities and\ndestruction in the Caribbean islands of Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy,\nwhich are two French overseas territories. Energy production after Hurricane\nIrma exhibited a significant decrease due to the destruction of the electricity\nnetwork as well as perturbations in economic and social activities. The energy\nproduction restoration rate was higher in Saint Barthelemy than in Saint\nMartin. The electricity restoration rate after a disaster was almost constant.\nHowever, the energy production 18 months after Hurricane Irma was identical to\nthat before Hurricane Irma in Saint Barthelemy; this was not the case in Saint\nMartin. During resilience, an increase in the gap between energy production in\nSaint Barthelemy and Saint Martin was observed. This study indicated that this\ngap represents an inequality growth between Saint Barthelemy (gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) of 40 000 euros/inhabitant) and Saint Martin (GDP of 16 600\neuros/inhabitant). The indicators emphasized that inequality growth after\nnatural disasters favors less vulnerable and more resilient territories.

      "abstract": "Global warming is seen as a drastic environmental problem nowadays. Carbon\ndioxide (CO 2 ) concentration in the Earth's atmosphere is linked to the\naverage temperature on the surface of the planet. Carbon capture and storage is\nan important technological endeavor aiming to improve the ecology. The present\nwork investigates reaction paths that are responsible for CO 2 chemisorption by\nthe ammonium- and phosphonium-based ionic liquids containing an aprotic\nheterocyclic anion 2-cyanopyrrolidine. We show that two moles of CO 2 per one\nmole of the gas scavenger can be theoretically fixed by such ionic liquids.\nBoth the cation and anion participate in the chemisorption. The corresponding\nstandard enthalpies are moderately negative. The barriers of all reactions\ninvolving the phosphonium-based cation are relatively small and favor practical\napplications of the considered sorbents. The performance of the ammonium-based\ncation is less favorable due to the inherent instability of the\ntetraalkylammonium ylide. The role is phosphonium ylide in the mechanism of the\nreaction is carefully characterized. The reported results foster a fundamental\nunderstanding of the outstanding CO 2 sorption performance of the quaternary\nammonium and phosphonium-based 2-cyanopyrrolidines.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity Bayesian experimental design\nframework to efficiently quantify the extreme-event statistics of an\ninput-to-response (ItR) system with given input probability and expensive\nfunction evaluations. The key idea here is to leverage low-fidelity samples\nwhose responses can be computed with a cost of a certain fraction of that for\nhigh-fidelity samples, in an optimized configuration to reduce the total\ncomputational cost. To accomplish this goal, we employ a multi-fidelity\nGaussian process as the surrogate model of the ItR function, and develop a new\nacquisition based on which the optimized next sample can be selected in terms\nof its location in the sample space and the fidelity level. In addition, we\ndevelop an inexpensive analytical evaluation of the acquisition and its\nderivative, avoiding numerical integrations that are prohibitive for\nhigh-dimensional problems. The new method is tested in a bi-fidelity context\nfor a series of synthetic problems with varying dimensions, low-fidelity model\naccuracy and computational costs. Comparing with the single-fidelity method and\nthe bi-fidelity method with a pre-defined fidelity hierarchy, our method\nconsistently shows the best (or among the best) performance for all the test\ncases. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of our method in solving an\nengineering problem of estimating the extreme ship motion statistics in\nirregular waves, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with two different\ngrid resolutions as the high and low fidelity models.",

      "abstract": "Power consumption is a key challenge in millimeter wave (mmWave) receiver\nfront-ends, due to the need to support high dimensional antenna arrays at wide\nbandwidths. Recently, there has been considerable work in developing low-power\nfront-ends, often based on low-resolution ADCs and low-power mixers. A critical\nbut less studied consequence of such designs is the relatively low-dynamic\nrange which in turn exposes the receiver to adjacent carrier interference and\nblockers. This paper provides a general mathematical framework for analyzing\nthe performance of mmWave front-ends in the presence of out-of-band\ninterference. The goal is to elucidate the fundamental trade-off of power\nconsumption, interference tolerance and in-band performance. The analysis is\ncombined with detailed network simulations in cellular systems with multiple\ncarriers, as well as detailed circuit simulations of key components at 140 GHz.\nThe analysis reveals critical bottlenecks for low-power interference robustness\nand suggests designs enhancements for use in practical systems.",

      "abstract": "In conversational search, agents can interact with users by asking clarifying\nquestions to increase their chance to find better results. Many recent works\nand shared tasks in both NLP and IR communities have focused on identifying the\nneed of asking clarifying questions and methodologies of generating them. These\nworks assume asking clarifying questions is a safe alternative to retrieving\nresults. As existing conversational search models are far from perfect, it's\npossible and common that they could retrieve or generate bad clarifying\nquestions. Asking too many clarifying questions can also drain user's patience\nwhen the user prefers searching efficiency over correctness. Hence, these\nmodels can get backfired and harm user's search experience because of these\nrisks by asking clarifying questions.\n  In this work, we propose a simulation framework to simulate the risk of\nasking questions in conversational search and further revise a risk-aware\nconversational search model to control the risk. We show the model's robustness\nand effectiveness through extensive experiments on three conversations\ndatasets, including MSDialog, Ubuntu Dialog Corpus, and Opendialkg in which we\ncompare it with multiple baselines. We show that the risk-control module can\nwork with two different re-ranker models and outperform all the baselines in\nmost of our experiments.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has drawn increasing interests in recent years\ndue to its tremendous success in various applications. However, standard RL\nalgorithms can only be applied for single reward function, and cannot adapt to\nan unseen reward function quickly. In this paper, we advocate a general\noperator view of reinforcement learning, which enables us to directly\napproximate the operator that maps from reward function to value function. The\nbenefit of learning the operator is that we can incorporate any new reward\nfunction as input and attain its corresponding value function in a zero-shot\nmanner. To approximate this special type of operator, we design a number of\nnovel operator neural network architectures based on its theoretical\nproperties. Our design of operator networks outperform the existing methods and\nthe standard design of general purpose operator network, and we demonstrate the\nbenefit of our operator deep Q-learning framework in several tasks including\nreward transferring for offline policy evaluation (OPE) and reward transferring\nfor offline policy optimization in a range of tasks.",

      "title": "Understanding Public Opinion on Using Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19\n  Treatment via Social Media",
      "abstract": "Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is used to prevent or treat malaria caused by\nmosquito bites. Recently, the drug has been suggested to treat COVID-19, but\nthat has not been supported by scientific evidence. The information regarding\nthe drug efficacy has flooded social networks, posting potential threats to the\ncommunity by perverting their perceptions of the drug efficacy. This paper\nstudies the reactions of social network users on the recommendation of using\nHCQ for COVID-19 treatment by analyzing the reaction patterns and sentiment of\nthe tweets. We collected 164,016 tweets from February to December 2020 and used\na text mining approach to identify social reaction patterns and opinion change\nover time. Our descriptive analysis identified an irregularity of the users'\nreaction patterns associated tightly with the social and news feeds on the\ndevelopment of HCQ and COVID-19 treatment. The study linked the tweets and\nGoogle search frequencies to reveal the viewpoints of local communities on the\nuse of HCQ for COVID-19 treatment across different states. Further, our tweet\nsentiment analysis reveals that public opinion changed significantly over time\nregarding the recommendation of using HCQ for COVID-19 treatment. The data\nshowed that high support in the early dates but it significantly declined in\nOctober. Finally, using the manual classification of 4,850 tweets by humans as\nour benchmark, our sentiment analysis showed that the Google Cloud Natural\nLanguage algorithm outperformed the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment\nReasoner in classifying tweets, especially in the sarcastic tweet group.",

      "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative\nagent of the current global COVID-19 pandemic, in which millions of lives have\nbeen lost. Understanding the zoonotic evolution of the coronavirus may provide\ninsights for developing effective vaccines, monitoring the transmission trends,\nand preventing new zoonotic infections. Homopolymeric nucleotide repeats (HP),\nthe most simple tandem repeats, are a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic genomes.\nYet the HP distributions and roles in coronavirus genome evolution are poorly\ninvestigated. In this study, we characterize the HP distributions and trends in\nthe genomes of bat and human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants. The results\nshow that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is abundant in HPs, and has augmented HP\ncontents during evolution. Especially, the disparity of HP poly-(A/T) and\nploy-(C/G) of coronaviruses increases during the evolution in human hosts. The\ndisparity of HP poly-(A/T) and ploy-(C/G) is correlated to host adaptation and\nthe virulence level of the coronaviruses. Therefore, we propose that the HP\ndisparity can be a quantitative measure for the zoonotic evolution levels of\ncoronaviruses. Peculiarly, the HP disparity measure infers that SARS-CoV-2\nOmicron variants have a high disparity of HP poly-(A/T) and ploy-(C/G),\nsuggesting a high adaption to the human hosts.",

While depth- and\nRGB-based pose refinement approaches increase the accuracy of the resulting\npose estimates, they are susceptible to ambiguity in the observation as they\nconsider visual alignment. We propose to leverage the fact that we often\nobserve static, rigid scenes. Thus, the objects therein need to be under\nphysically plausible poses. We show that considering plausibility reduces\nambiguity and, in consequence, allows poses to be more accurately predicted in\ncluttered environments. To this end, we extend a recent RL-based registration\napproach towards iterative refinement of object poses.

      "abstract": "The application of directed energy to spacecraft mission design is explored\nusing rapid transit to Mars as the design objective. An Earth-based laser array\nof unprecedented size (10~m diameter) and power (100~MW) is assumed to be\nenabled by ongoing developments in photonic laser technology. A phased-array\nlaser of this size and incorporating atmospheric compensation would be able to\ndeliver laser power to spacecraft in cislunar space, where the incident laser\nis focused into a hydrogen heating chamber via an inflatable reflector. The\nhydrogen propellant is then exhausted through a nozzle to realize specific\nimpulses of 3000 s. The architecture is shown to be immediately reusable via a\nburn-back maneuver to return the propulsion unit while still within range of\nthe Earth-based laser. The ability to tolerate much greater laser fluxes\nenables realizing the combination of high thrust and high specific impulse,\nmaking this approach favorable in comparison to laser-electric propulsion and\noccupying a parameter space similar to gas-core nuclear thermal rockets\n(without the requisite reactor). The heating chamber and its associated\nregenerative cooling and propellant handling systems are crucial elements of\nthe design that receive special attention in this study. The astrodynamics and\nthe extreme aerocapture maneuver required at Mars arrival after a 45-day\ntransit are also analyzed in detail. The application of laser-thermal\npropulsion as an enabling technology for other rapid transit missions in the\nsolar system and beyond is discussed.",

For two systems we also\nfound strong associated H$_2$ absorption $\\log\nN(\\text{H$_2$)[cm$^{-2}$]}=18.16\\pm0.03$ and $19.28\\pm0.06$ at $z=3.26$ and\n$2.25$ towards J2205+1021 and J2359+1354, respectively), while for the\nremaining five we measured conservative upper limits on the H$_2$ column\ndensities of typically $\\log N(\\text{H$_2$)[cm$^{-2}$]}<17.3$. The increased\nH$_2$ detection rate ($10-55$% at 68% confidence level) at high HI column\ndensity compared to the overall damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ population ($\\sim 5-10$%)\nconfirms previous works.

Recently we\nreported surface-active ILs contained the two well-known organic cations\n(1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium and tetrabutylammonium) and the two surface-active\nanions (lauryl sulfate, lauryl ether sulfate). In the present work, we\ninvestigate the affinity of these ionic compounds to the selected small\nmolecules that exhibit practical implications: water, hydrogen fluoride,\nhydrogen sulfate, and carbon dioxide. We identified that the sulfate group, the\nether groups, and the aromatic imidazole ring make the strongest contributions\nto the physical sorption of the polar gas molecules. In turn, the\ntetrabutylammonium cation, the saturated hydrocarbon chain of the anions, and\nthe alkyl chains of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium contribute to a significantly\nsmaller extent.

Populations\nconsisting of exclusively one of these types are known to reach an equilibrium,\nwhere every individual is satisfied with her decision. Yet it remains unknown\nwhether oscillations take place in a population consisting of both types, and\nif they do, what features they share. We study a well-mixed population of\nindividuals, which are either a coordinator or anticoordinator, each associated\nwith a possibly unique threshold and initialized with the strategy A or B. At\neach time, an agent becomes active to update her strategy based on her\nthreshold: an active coordinator (resp. anticoordinator) updates her strategy\nto A (resp. B) if the portion of other agents who have chosen A exceeds (falls\nshort of) her threshold, and updates to B (resp. A) otherwise. We define the\nstate of the population dynamics as the distribution over the thresholds of\nthose who have chosen A. We show that the population can admit several\nminimally positively invariant sets, where the solution trajectory oscillates.\nWe explicitly characterize a class of positively invariant sets, prove their\ninvariance, and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for their\nstability. Our results highlight the possibility of non-trivial, complex\noscillations in the absence of noise and population structure and shed light on\nthe reported oscillations in nature and human societies.",

      "title": "Protection or Peril of Following the Crowd in a Pandemic-Concurrent\n  Flood Evacuation",
      "abstract": "The decisions of whether and how to evacuate during a climate disaster are\ninfluenced by a wide range of factors, including sociodemographics, emergency\nmessaging, and social influence. Further complexity is introduced when multiple\nhazards occur simultaneously, such as a flood evacuation taking place amid a\nviral pandemic that requires physical distancing. Such multi-hazard events can\nnecessitate a nuanced navigation of competing decision-making strategies\nwherein a desire to follow peers is weighed against contagion risks. To better\nunderstand these nuances, we distributed an online survey during a pandemic\nsurge in July 2020 to 600 individuals in three midwestern and three southern\nstates in the United States with high risk of flooding. In this paper, we\nestimate a random parameter logit model in both preference space and\nwillingness-to-pay space. Our results show that the directionality and\nmagnitude of the influence of peers' choices of whether and how to evacuate\nvary widely across respondents. Overall, the decision of whether to evacuate is\npositively impacted by peer behavior, while the decision of how to evacuate is\nnegatively impacted by peers. Furthermore, an increase in flood threat level\nlessens the magnitude of these impacts. These findings have important\nimplications for the design of tailored emergency messaging strategies.\nSpecifically, emphasizing or deemphasizing the severity of each threat in a\nmulti-hazard scenario may assist in: (1) encouraging a reprioritization of\ncompeting risk perceptions and (2) magnifying or neutralizing the impacts of\nsocial influence, thereby (3) nudging evacuation decision-making toward a\ndesired outcome.",

      "abstract": "We study the diffusive behavior of chiral active (self-propelled) Brownian\nparticles in a two-dimensional microchannel with a Poiseuille flow. Using\nnumerical simulations, we show that the behavior of the transport coefficients\nof particles, for example, the average velocity $v$ and the effective diffusion\ncoefficient $D_{eff}$, strongly depends on flow strength $u_0$, translational\ndiffusion constant $D_0$, rotational diffusion rate $D_\\theta$, and chirality\nof the active particles $\\Omega$. It is demonstrated that the particles can\nexhibit upstream drift, resulting in a negative $v$, for the optimal parameter\nvalues of $u_0$, $D_\\theta$, and $\\Omega$. Interestingly, the direction of $v$\ncan be controlled by tuning these parameters. We observe that for some optimal\nvalues of $u_0$ and $\\Omega$, the chiral particles aggregate near a channel\nwall, and the corresponding $D_{eff}$ is enhanced. However, for the nonchiral\nparticles ($\\Omega = 0$), the $D_{eff}$ is suppressed by the presence of\nPoiseuille flow. It is expected that these findings have a great potential for\ndeveloping microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip devices for separating the active\nparticles.",

      "abstract": "While extensive-form games (EFGs) can be converted into normal-form games\n(NFGs), doing so comes at the cost of an exponential blowup of the strategy\nspace. So, progress on NFGs and EFGs has historically followed separate tracks,\nwith the EFG community often having to catch up with advances (e.g.,\nlast-iterate convergence and predictive regret bounds) from the larger NFG\ncommunity. In this paper we show that the Optimistic Multiplicative Weights\nUpdate (OMWU) algorithm -- the premier learning algorithm for NFGs -- can be\nsimulated on the normal-form equivalent of an EFG in linear time per iteration\nin the game tree size using a kernel trick. The resulting algorithm, Kernelized\nOMWU (KOMWU), applies more broadly to all convex games whose strategy space is\na polytope with 0/1 integral vertices, as long as the kernel can be evaluated\nefficiently. In the particular case of EFGs, KOMWU closes several standing gaps\nbetween NFG and EFG learning, by enabling direct, black-box transfer to EFGs of\ndesirable properties of learning dynamics that were so far known to be\nachievable only in NFGs. Specifically, KOMWU gives the first algorithm that\nguarantees at the same time last-iterate convergence, lower dependence on the\nsize of the game tree than all prior algorithms, and $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1)$\nregret when followed by all players.",

The odometry estimation module employs a keyframe-based\nfixed-lag smoothing approach for efficient and low-drift trajectory estimation,\nwith a bounded computation cost. The global mapping module constructs a factor\ngraph that minimizes the global registration error over the entire map with the\nsupport of IMU constraints, ensuring robust optimization in feature-less\nenvironments.

      "abstract": "Recent years have seen a significant amount of interests in Sequential\nRecommendation (SR), which aims to understand and model the sequential user\nbehaviors and the interactions between users and items over time. Surprisingly,\ndespite the huge success Sequential Recommendation has achieved, there is\nlittle study on Sequential Search (SS), a twin learning task that takes into\naccount a user's current and past search queries, in addition to behavior on\nhistorical query sessions. The SS learning task is even more important than the\ncounterpart SR task for most of E-commence companies due to its much larger\nonline serving demands as well as traffic volume.\n  To this end, we propose a highly scalable hybrid learning model that consists\nof an RNN learning framework leveraging all features in short-term user-item\ninteractions, and an attention model utilizing selected item-only features from\nlong-term interactions. As a novel optimization step, we fit multiple short\nuser sequences in a single RNN pass within a training batch, by solving a\ngreedy knapsack problem on the fly. Moreover, we explore the use of off-policy\nreinforcement learning in multi-session personalized search ranking.\nSpecifically, we design a pairwise Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient model\nthat efficiently captures users' long term reward in terms of pairwise\nclassification error.

The experimentally detected out-of-plane ferromagnetic\nordering is theoretically suported with Stoner criterion. Our findings open up\nnew possibilities to search novel 2D ferromagnets in non-layered compounds and\nrender opportunities for realizing realistic ultra-thin spintronic devices.",

However, in realistic applications, practitioners\noften require active learning with multiple sources of out-of-distribution\ndata, where it is unclear a priori which data sources will help or hurt the\ntarget domain. We survey a wide variety of techniques in active learning (AL),\ndomain shift detection (DS), and multi-domain sampling to examine this\nchallenging setting for question answering and sentiment analysis. We ask (1)\nwhat family of methods are effective for this task? And, (2) what properties of\nselected examples and domains achieve strong results? Among 18 acquisition\nfunctions from 4 families of methods, we find H-Divergence methods, and\nparticularly our proposed variant DAL-E, yield effective results, averaging\n2-3% improvements over the random baseline. We also show the importance of a\ndiverse allocation of domains, as well as room-for-improvement of existing\nmethods on both domain and example selection.

      "abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is an essential task to understand\nhuman-centric images from a fine-grained perspective. Although end-to-end HOI\ndetection models thrive, their paradigm of parallel human/object detection and\nverb class prediction loses two-stage methods' merit: object-guided hierarchy.\nThe object in one HOI triplet gives direct clues to the verb to be predicted.\nIn this paper, we aim to boost end-to-end models with object-guided statistical\npriors. Specifically, We propose to utilize a Verb Semantic Model (VSM) and use\nsemantic aggregation to profit from this object-guided hierarchy. Similarity KL\n(SKL) loss is proposed to optimize VSM to align with the HOI dataset's priors.\nTo overcome the static semantic embedding problem, we propose to generate\ncross-modality-aware visual and semantic features by Cross-Modal Calibration\n(CMC). The above modules combined composes Object-guided Cross-modal\nCalibration Network (OCN). Experiments conducted on two popular HOI detection\nbenchmarks demonstrate the significance of incorporating the statistical prior\nknowledge and produce state-of-the-art performances. More detailed analysis\nindicates proposed modules serve as a stronger verb predictor and a more\nsuperior method of utilizing prior knowledge.

      "abstract": "While deep networks can learn complex functions such as classifiers,\ndetectors, and trackers, many applications require models that continually\nadapt to changing input distributions, changing tasks, and changing\nenvironmental conditions. Indeed, this ability to continuously accrue knowledge\nand use past experience to learn new tasks quickly in continual settings is one\nof the key properties of an intelligent system. For complex and\nhigh-dimensional problems, simply updating the model continually with standard\nlearning algorithms such as gradient descent may result in slow adaptation.\nMeta-learning can provide a powerful tool to accelerate adaptation yet is\nconventionally studied in batch settings. In this paper, we study how\nmeta-learning can be applied to tackle online problems of this nature,\nsimultaneously adapting to changing tasks and input distributions and\nmeta-training the model in order to adapt more quickly in the future. Extending\nmeta-learning into the online setting presents its own challenges, and although\nseveral prior methods have studied related problems, they generally require a\ndiscrete notion of tasks, with known ground-truth task boundaries. Such methods\ntypically adapt to each task in sequence, resetting the model between tasks,\nrather than adapting continuously across tasks. In many real-world settings,\nsuch discrete boundaries are unavailable, and may not even exist. To address\nthese settings, we propose a Fully Online Meta-Learning (FOML) algorithm, which\ndoes not require any ground truth knowledge about the task boundaries and stays\nfully online without resetting back to pre-trained weights. Our experiments\nshow that FOML was able to learn new tasks faster than the state-of-the-art\nonline learning methods on Rainbow-MNIST, CIFAR100 and CELEBA datasets.",

      "abstract": "In real-world federated learning scenarios, participants could have their own\npersonalized labels which are incompatible with those from other clients, due\nto using different label permutations or tackling completely different tasks or\ndomains. However, most existing FL approaches cannot effectively tackle such\nextremely heterogeneous scenarios since they often assume that (1) all\nparticipants use a synchronized set of labels, and (2) they train on the same\ntask from the same domain. In this work, to tackle these challenges, we\nintroduce Factorized-FL, which allows to effectively tackle label- and\ntask-heterogeneous federated learning settings by factorizing the model\nparameters into a pair of vectors, where one captures the common knowledge\nacross different labels and tasks and the other captures knowledge specific to\nthe task each local model tackles. Moreover, based on the distance in the\nclient-specific vector space, Factorized-FL performs selective aggregation\nscheme to utilize only the knowledge from the relevant participants for each\nclient. We extensively validate our method on both label- and\ndomain-heterogeneous settings, on which it outperforms the state-of-the-art\npersonalized federated learning methods.",

However, the majority of these works are\nstrictly focused on the \"algorithmic\" part of continual learning for a \"fixed\nneural network architecture\", and the implications of using different\narchitectures are mostly neglected. Even the few existing continual learning\nmethods that modify the model assume a fixed architecture and aim to develop an\nalgorithm that efficiently uses the model throughout the learning experience.\nHowever, in this work, we show that the choice of architecture can\nsignificantly impact the continual learning performance, and different\narchitectures lead to different trade-offs between the ability to remember\nprevious tasks and learning new ones. Moreover, we study the impact of various\narchitectural decisions, and our findings entail best practices and\nrecommendations that can improve the continual learning performance.",

      "abstract": "Quantum state estimation, based on the numerical integration of stochastic\nmaster equations (SMEs), provides estimates for the evolution of quantum\nsystems subject to continuous weak measurements. The approach is similar to\nclassical state estimation methods in that the quantum trajectories produced by\nsolving the SME are conditioned on continuous classical measurement signals. In\nthis paper, we explore the use of classical state estimation for a candidate\nquantum system, one based on an experimentally realisable system: a material\nobject undergoing continuous feedback cooling in an optical trap. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that classical tracking methods based on particle\nfilters can be used to track quantum states, and are particularly useful for\nhigher temperature regimes where quantum state estimation becomes\ncomputationally demanding.",

      "abstract": "The Halpha emission of a set of southern gamma-Cas stars was monitored since\n2019, with the aim of detecting transition events and examining how their\npeculiar X-ray emission would react in such cases. Two stars, HD119682 and\nV767Cen, were found to display slowly decreasing disk emissions. These\ndecreases were not perfectly monotonic and several temporary and limited\nre-building events were observed. For HD119682, the emission component in\nHalpha disappeared in mid-July 2020. In X-rays, the X-ray flux was twice\nsmaller than recorded two decades ago but of a similar level as observed a\ndecade ago. The X-ray flux decreased over the campaign by 30%, but the hardness\nremained similar in datasets of all epochs. In particular, the gamma-Cas\ncharacter remained as clear as before even when there was no trace of disk\nemission in the Halpha line. For V767Cen, the full disappearance of disk\nemission in Halpha never occurred. We followed closely a disk rebuilding event,\nbut no significant change in flux or hardness was detected. These behaviours\nare compared to those of other gamma-Cas stars and their consequences on the\nX-ray generation are discussed.",

We start by\nexamining the rank characteristics of the subspace spanned by gradients across\nepochs (i.e., the gradient-space) in centralized model training, and observe\nthat this gradient-space often consists of a few leading principal components\naccounting for an overwhelming majority (95-99%) of the explained variance.\nMotivated by this, we propose the \"Look-back Gradient Multiplier\" (LBGM)\nalgorithm, which exploits this low-rank property to enable gradient recycling\nbetween model update rounds of federated learning, reducing transmissions of\nlarge parameters to single scalars for aggregation. We analytically\ncharacterize the convergence behavior of LBGM, revealing the nature of the\ntrade-off between communication savings and model performance. Our subsequent\nexperimental results demonstrate the improvement LBGM obtains in communication\noverhead compared to conventional federated learning on several datasets and\ndeep learning models. Additionally, we show that LBGM is a general\nplug-and-play algorithm that can be used standalone or stacked on top of\nexisting sparsification techniques for distributed model training.",

      "abstract": "Organic$-$inorganic hybrid Ruddlesden$-$Popper perovskites (HRPPs) have\ngained much attention for optoelectronic applications due to their high\nmoisture resistance, good processibility under ambient conditions, and long\nfunctional lifetimes. Recent success in isolating molecularly thin hybrid\nperovskite nanosheets and their intriguing edge phenomena have raised the need\nfor understanding the role of edges and the properties that dictate their\nfundamental behaviours. In this work, we perform a prototypical study on the\nedge effects in ultrathin hybrid perovskites by considering monolayer\n(BA)$_2$PbI$_4$ as a representative system. Based on first-principles\nsimulations of nanoribbon models, we show that in addition to significant\ndistortions of the octahedra network at the edges, strong edge stresses are\nalso present in the material. Structural instabilities that arise from the edge\nstress could drive the relaxation process and dominate the morphological\nresponse of edges in practice. A clear downward shift of the bands at the\nnarrower ribbons, as indicative of the edge effect, facilitates the separation\nof photo-excited carriers (electrons move towards the edge and holes move\ntowards the interior part of the nanosheet). Moreover, the desorption energy of\nthe organic molecule can also be much lower at the free edges, making it easier\nfor functionalization and/or substitution events to take place. The findings\nreported in this work elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for edge\nstates in HRPPs and will be important in guiding the rational design and\ndevelopment of high-performance layer$-$edge devices.",

      "abstract": "Question classification is one of the important links in the research of\nquestion and answering system. The existing question classification models are\nmore trained on public data sets. At present, there is a lack of question\nclassification data sets in specific fields, especially in the medical field.\nTo make up for this gap, this paper presents a data set for question\nclassification in the medical field. Moreover, this paper proposes a\nmulti-dimensional extraction of the characteristics of the question by\ncombining multiple neural network models, and proposes a question\nclassification model based on multi-dimensional feature extraction.

To that\nend, we characterise a phase modulator, directional coupler, and polarisation\nconverter at both ambient and cryogenic temperatures. The operation voltage\n$V_{\\pi/2}$ of these modulators increases due to the decrease of the\nelectro-optic effect by 74% for the phase modulator, 84% for the directional\ncoupler and 35% for the polarisation converter below 8.5$\\,\\mathrm{K}$.

The\ntheoretical contribution of this paper concerns the problem of observational\nequivalence between different IRFs, which implies non-identification of the IRF\nparameters without further restrictions. We show how the previously proposed\nminimal identification conditions are nested in the new framework and can be\nfurther augmented with overidentifying restrictions leading to efficiency\ngains. The current standard practice for the IRF estimation of DFMs is based on\nprincipal components, compared to which the new parametrization is less\nrestrictive and allows for modelling richer dynamics. As the empirical\ncontribution of the paper, we develop an estimation method based on the EM\nalgorithm, which incorporates the proposed identification restrictions. In the\nempirical application, we use a standard high-dimensional macroeconomic dataset\nto estimate the effects of a monetary policy shock. We estimate a strong\nreaction of the macroeconomic variables, while the benchmark models appear to\ngive qualitatively counterintuitive results. The estimation methods are\nimplemented in the accompanying R package.",

      "abstract": "The principal ratio of a graph is the ratio of the greatest and least entry\nof its principal eigenvector. Since the principal ratio compares the extreme\nvalues of the principal eigenvector it is sensitive to outliers. This can be\nproblematic for graphs (networks) drawn from empirical data. To account for\nthis we consider the dispersion of the principal eigenvector (and degree\nvector). More precisely, we consider the coefficient of variation of the\naforementioned vectors, that is, the ratio of the vector's standard deviation\nand mean. We show how both of these statistics are bounded above by the same\nfunction of the principal ratio. Further this bound is sharp for regular\ngraphs. The goal of this paper is to show that the coefficient of variation of\nthe principal eigenvector (and degree vector) can converge or diverge to the\nprincipal ratio in the limit.

      "abstract": "In the present work, we first introduce a general framework for modelling\ncomplex multiscale fluids and then focus on the derivation and analysis of a\nnew hybrid continuum-kinetic model. In particular, we combine conservation of\nmass and momentum for an isentropic macroscopic model with a kinetic\nrepresentation of the microscopic behaviour. After introducing a small scale of\ninterest, we compute the complex stress tensor by means of Irving-Kirkwood\nformula. The latter requires an expansion of kinetic distribution around an\nequilibrium state and a successive homogenization over the fast in time and\nsmall in space scale dynamics. For a new hybrid continuum-kinetic model the\nresults of linear stability analysis indicates a conditional stability in the\nrelevant low-speed regimes and instability for high speed regimes for higher\nmodes. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that the proposed multiscale\nmodel can reflect new phenomena of complex fluids not being present in standard\nNewtonian fluids. Consequently, the proposed general technique can be\nsuccessfully used to derive new interesting systems combining the macro and\nmicro structure of a given physical problem.",

While the influence of unit size on such collective\nmeasures was already demonstrated a decade ago, institutional ratings based on\nthis metric can still be found and still impact on the reputations and funding\nof many research institutions. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the\nfallacy of this approach to collective research-quality assessment in a simple\nway, focusing on the h-index in its original form. We show that randomly\nreshuffling real scientometric data (varying numbers of citations) amongst\ninstitutions of varying size, while maintaining the volume of their research\noutputs, has little effect on their departmental h-index. This suggests that\nthe relative position in ratings based on the collective h-index is determined\nnot only by quality (impact) of particular research outputs but by their\nvolume. Therefore, the application of the collective h-index in its original\nform is disputable as a basement for comparison at aggregated levels such as to\nresearch groups, institutions or journals. We suggest a possible remedy for\nthis failing which is implementable in a manner that is as simple and\nunderstandable as the h-index itself.",

Such studies have relied on\nnumerical simulations to demonstrate the improved bandwidth of the bi-stable\nabsorbers. In this work, we aim to understand how the shape of the bi-stable\nrestoring force influences the effective bandwidth of the absorber. To this\nend, we use perturbation methods to obtain an approximate analytical solution\nof the nonlinear differential equations governing the complex motion of the\nabsorber under harmonic wave excitations. The approximate solution is validated\nagainst a numerical solution obtained via direct integration of the equations\nof motion. Using a local stability analysis of the equations governing the slow\nmodulation of the amplitude and phase of the response, the loci of the\ndifferent bifurcation points are determined as function of the wave frequency\nand amplitude. Those bifurcation points are then used to define an effective\nbandwidth of the absorber. The influence of the shape of the restoring force on\nthe effective bandwidth is also characterized by generating design maps that\ncan be used to predict the kind of response behavior (small amplitude periodic,\nlarge amplitude periodic, or aperiodic) for any given combination of wave\namplitude and frequency. Such maps are critical towards designing efficient\nbi-stable PWAs for known wave conditions.",

As a result, the community proposed the Digital Twin\nNetworks (DTN) as a key enabler of efficient network management. Network\noperators can leverage the DTN to perform different optimization tasks (e.g.,\nTraffic Engineering, Network Planning). Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nshowed a high performance when applied to solve network optimization problems.\nIn the context of DTN, DRL can be leveraged to solve optimization problems\nwithout directly impacting the real-world network behavior. However, DRL scales\npoorly with the problem size and complexity. In this paper, we explore the use\nof Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to train DRL agents for solving a routing\noptimization problem. The experimental results show that ES achieved a training\ntime speed-up of 128 and 6 for the NSFNET and GEANT2 topologies respectively.",

      "abstract": "Learning arguments is highly relevant to the field of explainable artificial\nintelligence. It is a family of symbolic machine learning techniques that is\nparticularly human-interpretable. These techniques learn a set of arguments as\nan intermediate representation. Arguments are small rules with exceptions that\ncan be chained to larger arguments for making predictions or decisions. We\ninvestigate the learning of arguments, specifically the learning of arguments\nfrom a 'case model' proposed by Verheij [34]. The case model in Verheij's\napproach are cases or scenarios in a legal setting. The number of cases in a\ncase model are relatively low. Here, we investigate whether Verheij's approach\ncan be used for learning arguments from other types of data sets with a much\nlarger number of instances. We compare the learning of arguments from a case\nmodel with the HeRO algorithm [15] and learning a decision tree.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning approaches are successful in a wide range of AI problems and in\nparticular for visual recognition tasks. However, there are still open problems\namong which is the capacity to handle streams of visual information and the\nmanagement of class imbalance in datasets. Existing research approaches these\ntwo problems separately while they co-occur in real world applications. Here,\nwe study the problem of learning incrementally from imbalanced datasets. We\nfocus on algorithms which have a constant deep model complexity and use a\nbounded memory to store exemplars of old classes across incremental states.\nSince memory is bounded, old classes are learned with fewer images than new\nclasses and an imbalance due to incremental learning is added to the initial\ndataset imbalance. A score prediction bias in favor of new classes appears and\nwe evaluate a comprehensive set of score calibration methods to reduce it.\nEvaluation is carried with three datasets, using two dataset imbalance\nconfigurations and three bounded memory sizes. Results show that most\ncalibration methods have beneficial effect and that they are most useful for\nlower bounded memory sizes, which are most interesting in practice. As a\nsecondary contribution, we remove the usual distillation component from the\nloss function of incremental learning algorithms. We show that simpler vanilla\nfine tuning is a stronger backbone for imbalanced incremental learning\nalgorithms.",

We also compare\ntwo training schemes for active learning: (1) the one commonly deployed in deep\nactive learning using model fine tuning for each iteration and (2) a scheme\nwhich is inspired by transfer learning and exploits generic pre-trained models\nand train shallow classifiers for each iteration. Evaluation is run with three\nimbalanced datasets. Results show that the proposed active learning method\noutperforms competitive baselines.

As such, these methods often perform poorly in the face of biased\ndata, which breaks this assumption. In particular, machine learning models have\nbeen shown to exhibit Clever-Hans-like behaviour, meaning that spurious\ncorrelations in the training set are inadvertently learnt. A number of works\nhave been proposed to revise deep classifiers to learn the right correlations.\nHowever, generative models have been overlooked so far. We observe that\ngenerative models are also prone to Clever-Hans-like behaviour. To counteract\nthis issue, we propose to debias generative models by disentangling their\ninternal representations, which is achieved via human feedback. Our experiments\nshow that this is effective at removing bias even when human feedback covers\nonly a small fraction of the desired distribution. In addition, we achieve\nstrong disentanglement results in a quantitative comparison with recent\nmethods.",

      "abstract": "Graph-based temporal classification (GTC), a generalized form of the\nconnectionist temporal classification loss, was recently proposed to improve\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using graph-based supervision. For\nexample, GTC was first used to encode an N-best list of pseudo-label sequences\ninto a graph for semi-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose an\nextension of GTC to model the posteriors of both labels and label transitions\nby a neural network, which can be applied to a wider range of tasks. As an\nexample application, we use the extended GTC (GTC-e) for the multi-speaker\nspeech recognition task. The transcriptions and speaker information of\nmulti-speaker speech are represented by a graph, where the speaker information\nis associated with the transitions and ASR outputs with the nodes. Using GTC-e,\nmulti-speaker ASR modelling becomes very similar to single-speaker ASR\nmodeling, in that tokens by multiple speakers are recognized as a single merged\nsequence in chronological order. For evaluation, we perform experiments on a\nsimulated multi-speaker speech dataset derived from LibriSpeech, obtaining\npromising results with performance close to classical benchmarks for the task.",

      "abstract": "A fundamental task underlying many important optimization problems, from\ninfluence maximization to sensor placement to content recommendation, is to\nselect the optimal group of $k$ items from a larger set. Submodularity has been\nvery effective in allowing approximation algorithms for such subset selection\nproblems. However, in several applications, we are interested not only in the\nelements of a set, but also the order in which they appear, breaking the\nassumption that all selected items receive equal consideration. One such\ncategory of applications involves the presentation of search results, product\nrecommendations, news articles, and other content, due to the well-documented\nphenomenon that humans pay greater attention to higher-ranked items. As a\nresult, optimization in content presentation for diversity, user coverage,\ncalibration, or other objectives more accurately represents a sequence\nselection problem, to which traditional submodularity approximation results no\nlonger apply. Although extensions of submodularity to sequences have been\nproposed, none is designed to model settings where items contribute based on\ntheir position in a ranked list, and hence they are not able to express these\ntypes of optimization problems. In this paper, we aim to address this modeling\ngap.\n  Here, we propose a new formalism of ordered submodularity that captures these\nordering problems in content presentation, and more generally a category of\noptimization problems over ranked sequences in which different list positions\ncontribute differently to the objective function. We analyze the natural\nordered analogue of the greedy algorithm and show that it provides a\n$2$-approximation. We also show that this bound is tight, establishing that our\nnew framework is conceptually and quantitatively distinct from previous\nformalisms of set and sequence submodularity.",

The first order derivative of a\nnonlinear operator is assumed to satisfy the generalized Lipschitz condition,\ni.e. the $\\kappa$-average condition.

However, the\nmajority of existing models require pre-training on a large set of parallel\nimage-text data, which is costly to collect, compared to image-only or\ntext-only data. In this paper, we explore unsupervised Vision-and-Language\npre-training (UVLP) to learn the cross-modal representation from non-parallel\nimage and text datasets. We found two key factors that lead to good\nunsupervised V+L pre-training without parallel data: (i) joint image-and-text\ninput (ii) overall image-text alignment (even for non-parallel data).\nAccordingly, we propose a novel unsupervised V+L pre-training curriculum for\nnon-parallel texts and images. We first construct a weakly aligned image-text\ncorpus via a retrieval-based approach, then apply a set of multi-granular\nalignment pre-training tasks, including region-to-tag, region-to-phrase, and\nimage-to-sentence alignment, to bridge the gap between the two modalities. A\ncomprehensive ablation study shows each granularity is helpful to learn a\nstronger pre-trained model.

      "abstract": "While GPT has become the de-facto method for text generation tasks, its\napplication to pinyin input method remains unexplored. In this work, we make\nthe first exploration to leverage Chinese GPT for pinyin input method. We find\nthat a frozen GPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on perfect pinyin.\nHowever, the performance drops dramatically when the input includes abbreviated\npinyin. A reason is that an abbreviated pinyin can be mapped to many perfect\npinyin, which links to even larger number of Chinese characters. We mitigate\nthis issue with two strategies, including enriching the context with pinyin and\noptimizing the training process to help distinguish homophones. To further\nfacilitate the evaluation of pinyin input method, we create a dataset\nconsisting of 270K instances from 15 domains. Results show that our approach\nimproves performance on abbreviated pinyin across all domains. Model analysis\ndemonstrates that both strategies contribute to the performance boost.",

The key\nidea is to incorporate the internal inhomogeneity information (e.g., edges of\nthe detected objects) into the EIT reconstruction process, aiming to preserve\nthe conductivity profiles (to be detected). We study the NWATV image\nreconstruction by employing a novel soft thresholding based reformulation\nincluded in the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). To evaluate\nthe proposed approach, 2D and 3D numerical experiments and human EIT lung\nimaging are carried out. It is demonstrated that the properties of the internal\ninhomogeneity are well preserved and improved with the proposed regularization\napproach, in comparison to traditional total variation (TV) and recently\nproposed fidelity embedded regularization approaches. Owing to the simplicity\nof the proposed method, the computational cost is significantly decreased\ncompared with the well established primal-dual algorithm. Meanwhile, it was\nfound that the proposed regularization method is quite robust to the\nmeasurement noise, which is one of the main uncertainties in EIT.",

These questions often involve three\ntime-related challenges that previous work fail to adequately address: 1)\nquestions often do not specify exact timestamps of interest (e.g., \"Obama\"\ninstead of 2000); 2) subtle lexical differences in time relations (e.g.,\n\"before\" vs \"after\"); 3) off-the-shelf temporal KG embeddings that previous\nwork builds on ignore the temporal order of timestamps, which is crucial for\nanswering temporal-order related questions. In this paper, we propose a\ntime-sensitive question answering (TSQA) framework to tackle these problems.\nTSQA features a timestamp estimation module to infer the unwritten timestamp\nfrom the question. We also employ a time-sensitive KG encoder to inject\nordering information into the temporal KG embeddings that TSQA is based on.\nWith the help of techniques to reduce the search space for potential answers,\nTSQA significantly outperforms the previous state of the art on a new benchmark\nfor question answering over temporal KGs, especially achieving a 32% (absolute)\nerror reduction on complex questions that require multiple steps of reasoning\nover facts in the temporal KG.",

      "abstract": "Owing to the fluctuant renewable generation and power demand, the energy\nsurplus or deficit in each nanogrid is embodied differently across time. To\nstimulate local renewable energy consumption and minimize the long-term energy\ncost, some issues still remain to be explored: when and how the energy demand\nand bidirectional trading prices are scheduled considering personal comfort\npreferences and environmental factors. For this purpose, the demand response\nand two-way pricing problems concurrently for nanogrids and a public monitoring\nentity (PME) are studied with exploiting the large potential thermal elastic\nability of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) units. Different\nfrom nanogrids, in terms of minimizing time-average costs, PME aims to set\nreasonable prices and optimize profits by trading with nanogrids and the main\ngrid bi-directionally. In particular, such bilevel energy management problem is\nformulated as a stochastic form in a long-term horizon. Since there are\nuncertain system parameters, time-coupled queue constraints and the interplay\nof bilevel decision-making, it is challenging to solve the formulated problems.\nTo this end, we derive a form of relaxation based on Lyapunov optimization\ntechnique to make the energy management problem tractable without forecasting\nthe related system parameters. The transaction between nanogrids and PME is\ncaptured by a one-leader and multi-follower Stackelberg game framework. Then,\ntheoretical analysis of the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium\n(SE) is developed based on the proposed game property. Following that, we\ndevise an optimization algorithm to reach the SE with less information\nexchange. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach.",

      "abstract": "It is anticipated that large-scale energy storage facility (ESF) will become\nan essential part of the future energy markets to increase the penetration of\nrenewables. In this paper, a new optimization algorithm is developed to\nparticipate in large-scale merchant ESF to deal with renewables fluctuations.\nThe ESF is an investor-owned and independently-operated, seeking to maximize\nits total profit while hedging the system against net-load variation. To do so,\nan exact computationally efficient bi-level mixed-integer linear programming\n(MILP) is envisaged. The ESF operator tries to maximize its own profit at the\nupper level while ISO seeks to clear the markets at the lower level. In\nprinciple, the ESF will be able to construct its bidding/offering curves to\nbuy/sell from/to different markets. To maintain the tractability of the\nproblem, each lower level is replaced by its KKT optimality conditions, and\nnonlinearities are converted into linear equivalents using strong duality\ntheory rendering the single-level MILP and consequently recast as an MPEC.\nAdditionally, the proposed framework is constructed according to the\ninformation gap decision theory (IGDT) instrument to capture the adverse impact\nof uncertainty on the profit of ESF.",

      "abstract": "A variant of the online knapsack problem is considered in the settings of\ntrusted and untrusted predictions. In Unit Profit Knapsack, the items have unit\nprofit, and it is easy to find an optimal solution offline: Pack as many of the\nsmallest items as possible into the knapsack. For Online Unit Profit Knapsack,\nthe competitive ratio is unbounded. In contrast, previous work on online\nalgorithms with untrusted predictions generally studied problems where an\nonline algorithm with a constant competitive ratio is known. The prediction,\npossibly obtained from a machine learning source, that our algorithm uses is\nthe average size of those smallest items that fit in the knapsack. For the\nprediction error in this hard online problem, we use the ratio\n$r=\\frac{a}{\\hat{a}}$ where $a$ is the actual value for this average size and\n$\\hat{a}$ is the prediction. The algorithm presented achieves a competitive\nratio of $\\frac{1}{2r}$ for $r\\geq 1$ and $\\frac{r}{2}$ for $r\\leq 1$. Using an\nadversary technique, we show that this is optimal in some sense, giving a\ntrade-off in the competitive ratio attainable for different values of $r$. Note\nthat the result for accurate advice, $r=1$, is only $\\frac{1}{2}$, but we show\nthat no algorithm knowing the value $a$ can achieve a competitive ratio better\nthan $\\frac{e-1}{e}\\approx 0.6321$ and present an algorithm with a matching\nupper bound. We also show that this latter algorithm attains a competitive\nratio of $r\\frac{e-1}{e}$ for $r \\leq 1$ and $\\frac{e-r}{e}$ for $1 \\leq r <\ne$, and no algorithm can be better for both $r<1$ and $1\\leq r<e$.",

      "abstract": "Whole word masking (WWM), which masks all subwords corresponding to a word at\nonce, makes a better English BERT model. For the Chinese language, however,\nthere is no subword because each token is an atomic character. The meaning of a\nword in Chinese is different in that a word is a compositional unit consisting\nof multiple characters. Such difference motivates us to investigate whether WWM\nleads to better context understanding ability for Chinese BERT. To achieve\nthis, we introduce two probing tasks related to grammatical error correction\nand ask pretrained models to revise or insert tokens in a masked language\nmodeling manner. We construct a dataset including labels for 19,075 tokens in\n10,448 sentences. We train three Chinese BERT models with standard\ncharacter-level masking (CLM), WWM, and a combination of CLM and WWM,\nrespectively. Our major findings are as follows: First, when one character\nneeds to be inserted or replaced, the model trained with CLM performs the best.\nSecond, when more than one character needs to be handled, WWM is the key to\nbetter performance. Finally, when being fine-tuned on sentence-level downstream\ntasks, models trained with different masking strategies perform comparably.",

      "abstract": "The motion of planar ground vehicles is often non-holonomic, and as a result\nmay be modelled by the 2 DoF Ackermann steering model. We analyse the\nfeasibility of estimating such motion with a downward facing camera that exerts\nfronto-parallel motion with respect to the ground plane. This turns the motion\nestimation into a simple image registration problem in which we only have to\nidentify a 2-parameter planar homography. However, one difficulty that arises\nfrom this setup is that ground-plane features are indistinctive and thus hard\nto match between successive views. We encountered this difficulty by\nintroducing the first globally-optimal, correspondence-less solution to\nplane-based Ackermann motion estimation. The solution relies on the\nbranch-and-bound optimisation technique. Through the low-dimensional\nparametrisation, a derivation of tight bounds, and an efficient implementation,\nwe demonstrate how this technique is eventually amenable to accurate real-time\nmotion estimation. We prove its property of global optimality and analyse the\nimpact of assuming a locally constant centre of rotation. Our results on real\ndata finally demonstrate a significant advantage over the more traditional,\ncorrespondence-based hypothesise-and-test schemes.",

      "abstract": "Fast spin manipulation in magnetic heterostructures, where magnetic\ninteractions between different materials often define the functionality of\ndevices, is a key issue in the development of ultrafast spintronics. Although\nrecently developed optical approaches such as ultrafast spin-transfer and\nspin-orbit torques open new pathways to fast spin manipulation, these processes\ndo not fully utilize the unique possibilities offered by interfacial magnetic\ncoupling effects in ferromagnetic multilayer systems. Here, we experimentally\ndemonstrate ultrafast photo-enhanced interfacial exchange interactions in the\nferromagnetic Co$_2$FeAl/(Ga,Mn)As system at low laser fluence levels. The\nexcitation efficiency of Co$_2$FeAl with the (Ga,Mn)As layer is 30-40 times\nhigher than the case with the GaAs layer at 5 K due to a photo-enhanced\nexchange coupling interaction via photoexcited charge transfer between the two\nferromagnetic layers. In addition, the coherent spin precessions persist to\nroom temperature, excluding the drive of photo-enhanced magnetization in the\n(Ga,Mn)As layer and indicating a proximity-effect-related optical excitation\nmechanism. The results highlight the importance of considering the range of\ninterfacial exchange interactions in ferromagnetic heterostructures and how\nthese magnetic coupling effects can be utilized for ultrafast, low-power spin\nmanipulation.",

      "abstract": "Estimating 6D object pose from an RGB image is important for many real-world\napplications such as autonomous driving and robotic grasping. Recent deep\nlearning models have achieved significant progress on this task but their\nrobustness received little research attention. In this work, for the first\ntime, we study adversarial samples that can fool deep learning models with\nimperceptible perturbations to input image. In particular, we propose a Unified\n6D pose estimation Attack, namely U6DA, which can successfully attack several\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models for 6D pose estimation. The key\nidea of our U6DA is to fool the models to predict wrong results for object\ninstance localization and shape that are essential for correct 6D pose\nestimation. Specifically, we explore a transfer-based black-box attack to 6D\npose estimation. We design the U6DA loss to guide the generation of adversarial\nexamples, the loss aims to shift the segmentation attention map away from its\noriginal position. We show that the generated adversarial samples are not only\neffective for direct 6D pose estimation models, but also are able to attack\ntwo-stage models regardless of their robust RANSAC modules. Extensive\nexperiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability,\nand anti-defense capability of our U6DA on large-scale public benchmarks. We\nalso introduce a new U6DA-Linemod dataset for robustness study of the 6D pose\nestimation task. Our codes and dataset will be available at\n\\url{https://github.com/cuge1995/U6DA}.",

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders, which seriously\naffects one's life. Traditional depression diagnostics commonly depends on\nrating with scales, which can be labor-intensive and subjective. In this\ncontext, Automatic Depression Detection (ADD) has been attracting more\nattention for its low cost and objectivity. ADD systems are able to detect\ndepression automatically from some medical records, like video sequences.\nHowever, it remains challenging to effectively extract depression-specific\ninformation from long sequences, thereby hindering a satisfying accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel ADD method via learning and fusing features from\nvisual cues. Specifically, we firstly construct Temporal Dilated Convolutional\nNetwork (TDCN), in which multiple Dilated Convolution Blocks (DCB) are designed\nand stacked, to learn the long-range temporal information from sequences. Then,\nthe Feature-Wise Attention (FWA) module is adopted to fuse different features\nextracted from TDCNs. The module learns to assign weights for the feature\nchannels, aiming to better incorporate different kinds of visual features and\nfurther enhance the detection accuracy. Our method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on the DAIC_WOZ dataset compared to other\nvisual-feature-based methods, showing its effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Non-regular sampling can reduce aliasing at the expense of noise. Recently,\nit has been shown that non-regular sampling can be carried out using a\nconventional regular imaging sensor when the surface of its individual pixels\nis partially covered. This technique is called quarter sampling (also 1/4\nsampling), since only one quarter of each pixel is sensitive to light. For this\npurpose, the choice of a proper sampling mask is crucial to achieve a high\nreconstruction quality. In the scope of this work, we present an iterative\nalgorithm to improve an arbitrary quarter sampling mask which results in a\ncontinuous increase of the reconstruction quality. In terms of the\nreconstruction algorithms, we test two simple algorithms, namely, linear\ninterpolation and nearest neighbor interpolation, as well as two more\nsophisticated algorithms, namely, steering kernel regression and frequency\nselective extrapolation. Besides PSNR gains of +0.31 dB to +0.68 dB relative to\na random quarter sampling mask resulting from our optimized mask, visually\nnoticeable enhancements are perceptible.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we deal with the problem of creating globally consistent pose\ngraphs in a centralized multi-robot SLAM framework. For each robot to act\nautonomously, individual onboard pose estimates and maps are maintained, which\nare then communicated to a central server to build an optimized global map.\nHowever, inconsistencies between onboard and server estimates can occur due to\nonboard odometry drift or failure. Furthermore, robots do not benefit from the\ncollaborative map if the server provides no feedback in a computationally\ntractable and bandwidth-efficient manner. Motivated by this challenge, this\npaper proposes a novel collaborative mapping framework to enable accurate\nglobal mapping among robots and server. In particular, structural differences\nbetween robot and server graphs are exploited at different spatial scales using\ngraph spectral analysis to generate necessary constraints for the individual\nrobot pose graphs. The proposed approach is thoroughly analyzed and validated\nusing several real-world multi-robot field deployments where we show\nimprovements of the onboard system up to 90%.",

In this paper, we argue that instead of being a\nquestionable assumption, IID is a fundamental task-relevant property that needs\nto be learned. Consider $k$ independent random vectors $\\mathsf{X}^{i = 1,\n\\ldots, k}$, we elaborate on how a variety of different causal questions can be\nreformulated to learning a task-relevant function $\\phi$ that induces IID among\n$\\mathsf{Z}^i := \\phi \\circ \\mathsf{X}^i$, which we term IID representation\nlearning.\n  For proof of concept, we examine the IID representation learning on\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization tasks. Concretely, by utilizing the\nrepresentation obtained via the learned function that induces IID, we conduct\nprediction of molecular characteristics (molecular prediction) on two\nbiomedical datasets with real-world distribution shifts introduced by a)\npreanalytical variation and b) sampling protocol. To enable reproducibility and\nfor comparison to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, this is done by\nfollowing the OOD benchmarking guidelines recommended from WILDS. Compared to\nthe SOTA baselines supported in WILDS, the results confirm the superior\nperformance of IID representation learning on OOD tasks.

The neutron powder diffraction experiments show the ferromagnetic\nordering of Ce3+ magnetic moments with a value of ~ 1.2 Bohr magneton at 1.8 K,\noriented perpendicular to the hexagonal c-axis. By using symmetry analysis, we\nhave found the solutions for the magnetic structure in the ferromagnetic\nShubnikov space groups Cmc'21' and P21'/m' for x < 0.5 and x >= 0.5,\nrespectively. Electrical resistivity exhibits a metallic temperature behaviour\nin all compounds. The resistivity has a local minimum in the paramagnetic state\ndue to Kondo effects at high doping x = 0.8 and 1.0.

      "abstract": "Quarter sampling is a novel sensor concept that enables the acquisition of\nhigher resolution images without increasing the number of pixels. This is\nachieved by covering three quarters of each pixel of a low-resolution sensor\nsuch that only one quadrant of the sensor area of each pixel is sensitive to\nlight. By randomly masking different parts, effectively a non-regular sampling\nof a higher resolution image is performed. Combining a properly designed mask\nand a high-quality reconstruction algorithm, a higher image quality can be\nachieved than using a low-resolution sensor and subsequent upsampling. For the\nlatter case, the image quality can be enhanced using super resolution\nalgorithms. Recently, algorithms based on machine learning such as the Very\nDeep Super Resolution network (VDSR) proofed to be successful for this task. In\nthis work, we transfer the concepts of VDSR to the special case of quarter\nsampling. Besides adapting the network layout to take advantage of the case of\nquarter sampling, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique enabled by\nquarter sampling. Altogether, using the quarter sampling sensor, the image\nquality in terms of PSNR can be increased by +0.67 dB for the Urban 100 dataset\ncompared to using a low-resolution sensor with VDSR.",

However, recent works also reported\nevidence of a low temperature (protein-like) dynamical transition around 225 K\nin concentrated PNIPAM suspensions, independently of the polymer architecture,\ni.e., both for linear chains and for microgels. In this work, we investigate\nwater-polymer interactions by extensive differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)\nmeasurements of both systems, in order to understand the effect of the\ndifferent topological structures on the solution behaviour, in particular\nregarding crystallization and melting processes. In addition, we compare\nprotiated and deuterated microgels, in both water and deuterated water. The DSC\nresults are complemented by dynamic light scattering experiments, which confirm\nthat the selective isotopic substitution differently affects the solution\nbehaviour. Our findings highlight the important role played by the polymer\narchitecture on the solution behaviour: indeed, microgels turn out to be more\nefficient confining agents, able to avoid water crystallization in a wider\nconcentration range with respect to linear chains. Altogether, the present data\nwill be valuable to interpret future low-temperature investigations of PNIPAM\ndispersions, particularly by neutron scattering experiments.",

      "abstract": "In this thesis, we study the detailed partonic content of the quantum states\nof a quark-antiquark color dipole subject to high-energy evolution, which are\nrepresented by a set of dipoles generated by a stochastic binary branching\nprocess, in the scattering off a large nucleus, and produce predictions for\ndiffractive dissociation in electron-ion collisions, based on the dipole\npicture of QCD. Our main results are as follows. First, the scattering events\nof a color dipole, when parameters are set in such a way that the total cross\nsection is small, are triggered by rare partonic fluctuations, which look\ndifferent as seen from different reference frames. It turns out that the\nfreedom to select a frame allows to deduce an asymptotic expression for the\nrapidity distribution of the first branching of the slowest parent dipole of\nthe set of those which scatter. In another aspect, such study implies the\nimportance of the characterization of particle distribution in the frontier\nregion in the states generated by the QCD dipole branching, and more generally,\nby any one-dimensional branching random walk model. To this aim, we develop a\nMonte Carlo algorithm to generate the frontier region of a branching random\nwalk. Furthermore, we are able to calculate the diffractive cross section\ndemanding a minimal rapidity gap $Y_0$ and the distribution of rapidity gaps\n$Y_{gap}$ in the diffractive dissociation of a small dipole off a large\nnucleus, in a well-defined parametric region. They are the asymptotic solutions\nto the so-called Kovchegov-Levin equation, which describes the diffractive\ndissociation at high energy. Finally, we present predictions for the rapidity\ngap distributionin realistic kinematics of future electron-ion machines, based\non the numerical solutions of the original Kovchegov-Levin equation and of its\nnext-to-leading extension taking into account the running of the strong\ncoupling.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, cloud computing has been developing rapidly and is widely\nused in various fields such as commerce and scientific research. However,\nsecurity issues, including access control, are a very important problem in\npopularizing cloud computing and this has influenced its wide application of\ncloud computing. As one of the solutions to these problems, we have proposed a\nblockchain-based role-based access control model with the separation of duties\nconstraints in a cloud environment. In the model, we used Hyperledger Fabric as\na blockchain platform for storing the access control policies and provided\nseveral functions for effective role management. In addition, we presented an\naccess control scheme for cloud storage data by combining the proposed model\nand the verification mechanism for the user's ownership of a role and analyzed\nthe security properties of the scheme. Finally, we deployed Hyperledger Fabric\ntest network, implemented an online test system that performs access control\nusing the proposed scheme in the Ali cloud environment, and evaluated the model\nperformance in this scenario.",

      "abstract": "Automated essay scoring plays an important role in judging students' language\nabilities in education. Traditional approaches use handcrafted features to\nscore and are time-consuming and complicated. Recently, neural network\napproaches have improved performance without any feature engineering. Unlike\nother natural language processing tasks, only a small number of datasets are\npublicly available for automated essay scoring, and the size of the dataset is\nnot sufficiently large. Considering that the performance of a neural network is\nclosely related to the size of the dataset, the lack of data limits the\nperformance improvement of the automated essay scoring model. In this paper, we\nproposed a method to increase the number of essay-score pairs using\nback-translation and score adjustment and applied it to the Automated Student\nAssessment Prize dataset for augmentation. We evaluated the effectiveness of\nthe augmented data using models from prior work. In addition, performance was\nevaluated in a model using long short-term memory, which is widely used for\nautomated essay scoring.

      "abstract": "Assessing the structure and function of the right ventricle (RV) is important\nin the diagnosis of several cardiac pathologies. However, it remains more\nchallenging to segment the RV than the left ventricle (LV). In this paper, we\nfocus on segmenting the RV in both short (SA) and long-axis (LA) cardiac MR\nimages simultaneously. For this task, we propose a new multi-input/output\narchitecture, hybrid 2D/3D geometric spatial TransformEr Multi-Pass fEature\npyRAmid (Tempera). Our feature pyramid extends current designs by allowing not\nonly a multi-scale feature output but multi-scale SA and LA input images as\nwell. Tempera transfers learned features between SA and LA images via layer\nweight sharing and incorporates a geometric target transformer to map the\npredicted SA segmentation to LA space. Our model achieves an average Dice score\nof 0.836 and 0.798 for the SA and LA, respectively, and 26.31 mm and 31.19 mm\nHausdorff distances. This opens up the potential for the incorporation of RV\nsegmentation models into clinical workflows.",

The method\nincludes a modulation process for the sender, as well as demodulation and pose\nestimation steps for the receiver, where screen-camera communication technology\nis applied to hide fiducial tags using human vision property. Experiments have\ndemonstrated that IPT can achieve accuracy within ten centimeters and a speed\nof about ten FPS.

      "abstract": "Logical reasoning is of vital importance to natural language understanding.\nPrevious studies either employ graph-based models to incorporate prior\nknowledge about logical relations, or introduce symbolic logic into neural\nmodels through data augmentation. These methods, however, heavily depend on\nannotated training data, and thus suffer from over-fitting and poor\ngeneralization problems due to the dataset sparsity. To address these two\nproblems, in this paper, we propose MERIt, a MEta-path guided contrastive\nlearning method for logical ReasonIng of text, to perform self-supervised\npre-training on abundant unlabeled text data. Two novel strategies serve as\nindispensable components of our method. In particular, a strategy based on\nmeta-path is devised to discover the logical structure in natural texts,\nfollowed by a counterfactual data augmentation strategy to eliminate the\ninformation shortcut induced by pre-training. The experimental results on two\nchallenging logical reasoning benchmarks, i.e., ReClor and LogiQA, demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms the SOTA baselines with significant improvements.",

To\nremedy this problem, a number of explainable AI methods have been presented,\nsuch as SHAP and LIME, but these can be either be too costly to be used in\nreal-time robotic applications or provide only local explanations. In this\npaper, the main contribution is the use of a linear model tree (LMT) to\napproximate a DNN policy, originally trained via proximal policy\noptimization(PPO), for an autonomous surface vehicle with five control inputs\nperforming a docking operation. The two main benefits of the proposed approach\nare: a) LMTs are transparent which makes it possible to associate directly the\noutputs (control actions, in our case) with specific values of the input\nfeatures, b) LMTs are computationally efficient and can provide information in\nreal-time. In our simulations, the opaque DNN policy controls the vehicle and\nthe LMT runs in parallel to provide explanations in the form of feature\nattributions. Our results indicate that LMTs can be a useful component within\ndigital assurance frameworks for autonomous ships.",

      "abstract": "In this letter, we deal with evolutionary game theoretic learning processes\nfor population games on networks with dynamically evolving communities.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel mathematical framework in which a\ndeterministic, continuous-time replicator equation on a community network is\ncoupled with a closed dynamic flow process between communities that is governed\nby an environmental feedback mechanism, resulting in co-evolutionary dynamics.\nThrough a rigorous analysis of the system of differential equations obtained,\nwe characterize the equilibria of the coupled dynamical system. Moreover, for a\nclass of population games with two actions and symmetric rewards a Lyapunov\nargument is employed to establish an evolutionary folk theorem that guarantees\nconvergence to the evolutionary stable states of the game. Numerical\nsimulations are provided to illustrate and corroborate our findings.",

Using these user groups, we\nevaluate four collaborative filtering-based algorithms with respect to\npopularity bias on the item and the user level. Our findings are three-fold:\nfirstly, we show that users with little interest into popular items tend to\nhave large user profiles and thus, are important data sources for multimedia\nrecommender systems.

      "abstract": "Grasping made impressive progress during the last few years thanks to deep\nlearning. However, there are many objects for which it is not possible to\nchoose a grasp by only looking at an RGB-D image, might it be for physical\nreasons (e.g., a hammer with uneven mass distribution) or task constraints\n(e.g., food that should not be spoiled). In such situations, the preferences of\nexperts need to be taken into account.\n  In this paper, we introduce a data-efficient grasping pipeline (Latent Space\nGP Selector -- LGPS) that learns grasp preferences with only a few labels per\nobject (typically 1 to 4) and generalizes to new views of this object. Our\npipeline is based on learning a latent space of grasps with a dataset generated\nwith any state-of-the-art grasp generator (e.g., Dex-Net). This latent space is\nthen used as a low-dimensional input for a Gaussian process classifier that\nselects the preferred grasp among those proposed by the generator.\n  The results show that our method outperforms both GR-ConvNet and GG-CNN (two\nstate-of-the-art methods that are also based on labeled grasps) on the Cornell\ndataset, especially when only a few labels are used: only 80 labels are enough\nto correctly choose 80% of the grasps (885 scenes, 244 objects). Results are\nsimilar on our dataset (91 scenes, 28 objects).",

      "abstract": "Training a text-to-image generator in the general domain (e.g., Dall.e,\nCogView) requires huge amounts of paired text-image data, which is too\nexpensive to collect. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised scheme named\nas CLIP-GEN for general text-to-image generation with the language-image priors\nextracted with a pre-trained CLIP model. In our approach, we only require a set\nof unlabeled images in the general domain to train a text-to-image generator.\nSpecifically, given an image without text labels, we first extract the\nembedding of the image in the united language-vision embedding space with the\nimage encoder of CLIP. Next, we convert the image into a sequence of discrete\ntokens in the VQGAN codebook space (the VQGAN model can be trained with the\nunlabeled image dataset in hand). Finally, we train an autoregressive\ntransformer that maps the image tokens from its unified language-vision\nrepresentation. Once trained, the transformer can generate coherent image\ntokens based on the text embedding extracted from the text encoder of CLIP upon\nan input text. Such a strategy enables us to train a strong and general\ntext-to-image generator with large text-free image dataset such as ImageNet.\nQualitative and quantitative evaluations verify that our method significantly\noutperforms optimization-based text-to-image methods in terms of image quality\nwhile not compromising the text-image matching. Our method can even achieve\ncomparable performance as flagship supervised models like CogView.",

However, to achieve the optimal enhancement of performance, the\ninstantaneous channel state information (CSI) needs to be estimated at the cost\nof a large overhead that scales with the number of RIS elements and the number\nof users. In this paper, we design a quasi-static broad coverage at the RIS\nwith the reduced overhead based on the statistical CSI. We propose a design\nframework to synthesize the power pattern reflected by the RIS that meets the\ncustomized requirements of broad coverage. For the communication of broadcast\nchannels, we generalize the broad coverage of the single transmit stream to the\nscenario of multiple streams. Moreover, we employ the quasi-static broad\ncoverage for a multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access\n(OFDMA) system, and derive the analytical expression of the downlink rate,\nwhich is proved to increase logarithmically with the power gain reflected by\nthe RIS. By taking into account the overhead of channel estimation, the\nproposed quasi-static broad coverage even outperforms the design method that\noptimizes the RIS phases using the instantaneous CSI. Numerical simulations are\nconducted to verify these observations.",

      "abstract": "Naturals and synthetic perovskites are widely used functional materials\nthanks to their particular physical properties, such as superconductivity,\nferroelectricity and photo-activity. Many of these properties are related to\nstatic or dynamic motion of octahedral units; Yet a full understanding of the\nrelationships between perovskite crystal structure, chemical bonding and\nphysical properties is currently missing. Several studies indicate the\nexistence of dynamic disorder generated by anharmonic motion of octahedral\nunits e.g. in halide perovskite structures. In this work, we derive all\npossible space groups for simple perovskites $\\rm ABX_3$ with dynamical\noctahedral tilting. The derived space groups extend the well established space\ngroup tables for static tiltings by [Glazer, A. Acta Cryst. B 1972, 28,\n3384-3392; Aleksandrov, K. Ferroelectrics 1976, 24, 801-805; Howard, C.J.,\nStokes, H.T. Acta Cryst. B 1998, 54, 782-789]. We demonstrate ubiquity of\ndynamical tilting by analysing the structural data for perovskites reported in\nrecent scientific publications and discuss the signature of dynamic tilting in\nthe corresponding structures. Finally, we discuss the possible influence of\ndynamic disorder on the physical properties of halide perovskites.",

      "abstract": "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a 20 kton liquid\nscintillator detector currently being built in a dedicated underground\nlaboratory in China. It is a multi-purpose underground experiment with a\nphysics program including neutrino mass hierarchy determination, precision\nmeasurement of neutrino oscillation parameters, measurement of solar,\natmospheric, geo-neutrinos and other important neutrino physics searches.\nElectron anti-neutrinos are detected via the inverse beta decay by measuring\nthe correlated positron and neutron signals. In this detection channel cosmic\nray muon induced radioactive isotopes are the main background, especially those\nconnected to cosmogenic backgrounds ($^{9}$Li/$^{8}$He and fast neutrons). They\nare predominantly produced by showing muons which account for about 10\\% of all\nmuons. Considering that the $^{9}$Li/$^{8}$He background is correlated with the\nparent muon in time and space, the vertex reconstruction of showers along the\nmuon track is helpful to reject the backgrounds of $^{9}$Li/$^{8}$He and other\nisotopes. Based on the waveform simulation analysis, we know that the\nmulti-peaks in waveform output by PMTs are mainly caused by these showers.\nWaveform analysis of muon events and preliminary results of shower vertex\nreconstruction based on detector simulation have been studied.",

      "abstract": "Existing Deep Learning (DL) frameworks typically do not provide ready-to-use\nsolutions for robotics, where very specific learning, reasoning, and embodiment\nproblems exist. Their relatively steep learning curve and the different\nmethodologies employed by DL compared to traditional approaches, along with the\nhigh complexity of DL models, which often leads to the need of employing\nspecialized hardware accelerators, further increase the effort and cost needed\nto employ DL models in robotics. Also, most of the existing DL methods follow a\nstatic inference paradigm, as inherited by the traditional computer vision\npipelines, ignoring active perception, which can be employed to actively\ninteract with the environment in order to increase perception accuracy. In this\npaper, we present the Open Deep Learning Toolkit for Robotics (OpenDR). OpenDR\naims at developing an open, non-proprietary, efficient, and modular toolkit\nthat can be easily used by robotics companies and research institutions to\nefficiently develop and deploy AI and cognition technologies to robotics\napplications, providing a solid step towards addressing the aforementioned\nchallenges. We also detail the design choices, along with an abstract interface\nthat was created to overcome these challenges. This interface can describe\nvarious robotic tasks, spanning beyond traditional DL cognition and inference,\nas known by existing frameworks, incorporating openness, homogeneity and\nrobotics-oriented perception e.g., through active perception, as its core\ndesign principles.",

Also, in the particular case of this study,\nwe found that using more than around 40 cores does not bring a significant\ncomputation time gain. However, the origin of this limitation is explained by a\nthreshold-based search heuristic used to prune the search space. We have\nevidence that for similar data sets with less restrictive thresholds, the\nnumber of cores actually used could very well be much higher, allowing\nparallelization to have a much greater effect.",

      "abstract": "Quantum teleportation is a very helpful information-theoretic protocol that\nallows to transfer an unknown arbitrary quantum state from one location to\nanother without having to transmit the quantum system through the intermediate\nregion. Quantum states, quantum channels, and indefinite causal structures are\nall examples of quantum causal structures that not only enable advanced quantum\ninformation processing functions, but can also model causal structures in\nnonclassical spacetimes. In this letter, we develop quantum teleportation of\narbitrary quantum causal structures, as formalized by the process matrix\nframework. Instead of teleporting all the physical degrees of freedom that\nimplement the causal structure, the central idea is to just teleport the inputs\nto and outputs from the operations of agents. The communication of outcomes of\nBell state measurements, which is necessary for deterministic quantum\nteleportation, is not possible for all causal structures that one might wish to\ninvestigate. To avoid this problem, we propose partially and fully\npost-selected teleportation protocols. We prove that our partially\npost-selected teleportation protocol is compatible with all quantum causal\nstructures, including those that involve indefinite causal order.",

In\norder to get a more general result related on residual implications that\ninduced by aggregation functions, we relax the definition of general overlap\nfunctions, more precisely, removing its right-continuous, and then introduce a\nnew kind of aggregation functions, which called semi-overlap functions.\nSubsequently, we study some of their related algebraic properties and\ninvestigate their corresponding residual implications. Moreover, serval\nscholars have provided kinds of methods for fuzzy modus ponens (FMP,for short)\nproblems so far, such as Zadeh's compositional rule of inference (CRI, for\nshort), Wang's triple I method (TIM, for short) and the quintuple implication\nprinciple (QIP, for short). Compared with CRI and TIM methods, QIP method has\nsome advantages in solving FMP problems, in this paper, we further consider the\nQIP method for FMP problems and prove that it satisfies the reducibility of\nmultiple-rules fuzzy reasoning. Finally, we propose a new classification\nalgorithm that based on semi-overlap functions and QIP method, which called\nSO5I-FRC algorithm. Through the comparative tests, the average accuracy of\nSO5I-FRC algorithm is higher than FARC-HD algorithm.

However, it is found that the unsupervised\nlearning of fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) is more challenging than\nGOC and person re-ID. In order to bridge the gap between unsupervised and\nsupervised learning for FGVC, we investigate the essential factors (including\nfeature extraction, clustering, and contrastive learning) for the performance\ngap between supervised and unsupervised FGVC. Furthermore, we propose a simple,\neffective, and practical method, termed as UFCL, to alleviate the gap. Three\nkey issues are concerned and improved: First, we introduce a robust and\npowerful backbone, ResNet50-IBN, which has an ability of domain adaptation when\nwe transfer ImageNet pre-trained models to FGVC tasks. Next, we propose to\nintroduce HDBSCAN instead of DBSCAN to do clustering, which can generate better\nclusters for adjacent categories with fewer hyper-parameters. Finally, we\npropose a weighted feature agent and its updating mechanism to do contrastive\nlearning by using the pseudo labels with inevitable noise, which can improve\nthe optimization process of learning the parameters of the network. The\neffectiveness of our UFCL is verified on CUB-200-2011, Oxford-Flowers,\nOxford-Pets, Stanford-Dogs, Stanford-Cars and FGVC-Aircraft datasets. Under the\nunsupervised FGVC setting, we achieve state-of-the-art results, and analyze the\nkey factors and the important parameters to provide a practical guidance.",

      "abstract": "The Transition Edge Sensor is extremely sensitive to the change of\ntemperature, combined with the high-Z metal of a certain thickness, it can\nrealize the high energy resolution measurement of particles such as X-rays.\nX-rays with energies below 10 keV have very weak penetrating ability, so only a\nfew microns thick of gold or bismuth can obtain quantum efficiency higher than\n70\\%. Therefore, the entire structure of the TES X-ray detector in this energy\nrange can be realized in the microfabrication process. However, for X-rays or\ngamma rays from 10 keV to 200 keV, sub-millimeter absorber layers are required,\nwhich cannot be realized by microfabrication process. This paper first briefly\nintroduces a set of TES X-ray detectors and their auxiliary systems built by\nShanghaiTech University, then focus on the introduction of the TES $\\gamma$-ray\ndetector, with absorber based on an sub-millimeter lead-tin alloy sphere. The\ndetector has a quantum efficiency above 70\\% near 100 keV, and an energy\nresolution of about 161.5eV@59.5keV.",

      "abstract": "Privacy and ethics of citizens are at the core of the concerns raised by our\nincreasingly digital society. Profiling users is standard practice for software\napplications triggering the need for users, also enforced by laws, to properly\nmanage privacy settings. Users need to manage software privacy settings\nproperly to protect personally identifiable information and express personal\nethical preferences. AI technologies that empower users to interact with the\ndigital world by reflecting their personal ethical preferences can be key\nenablers of a trustworthy digital society. We focus on the privacy dimension\nand contribute a step in the above direction through an empirical study on an\nexisting dataset collected from the fitness domain. We find out which set of\nquestions is appropriate to differentiate users according to their preferences.\nThe results reveal that a compact set of semantic-driven questions (about\ndomain-independent privacy preferences) helps distinguish users better than a\ncomplex domain-dependent one. This confirms the study's hypothesis that moral\nattitudes are the relevant piece of information to collect. Based on the\noutcome, we implement a recommender system to provide users with suitable\nrecommendations related to privacy choices. We then show that the proposed\nrecommender system provides relevant settings to users, obtaining high\naccuracy.",

      "abstract": "Using the MeerKAT radio telescope, a series of observations have been\nconducted to time the known pulsars and search for new pulsars in the globular\ncluster NGC 6440. As a result, two pulsars have been discovered, NGC 6440G and\nNGC 6440H, one of which is isolated and the other a non-eclipsing (at\nfrequencies above 962 MHz) \"Black Widow\", with a very low mass companion\n(M$_{\\rm c}$ > 0.006 M$_{\\odot}$). It joins the other binary pulsars discovered\nso far in this cluster which all have low companion masses (M$_{\\rm c}$ < 0.30\nM$_{\\odot}$). We present the results of long-term timing solutions obtained\nusing data from both Green Bank and MeerKAT telescopes for these two new\npulsars and an analysis of the pulsars NGC 6440C and NGC 6440D. For the\nisolated pulsar NGC 6440C, we searched for planets using a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo technique. We find evidence for significant unmodelled variations but\nthey cannot be well modelled as planets nor as part of a power-law red-noise\nprocess. Studies of the eclipses of the \"Redback\" pulsar NGC 6440D at two\ndifferent frequency bands reveal a frequency dependence with longer and\nasymmetric eclipses at lower frequencies (962-1283 MHz).",

      "title": "Epipolar Focus Spectrum: A Novel Light Field Representation and\n  Application in Dense-view Reconstruction",
      "abstract": "Existing light field representations, such as epipolar plane image (EPI) and\nsub-aperture images, do not consider the structural characteristics across the\nviews, so they usually require additional disparity and spatial structure cues\nfor follow-up tasks. Besides, they have difficulties dealing with occlusions or\nlarger disparity scenes. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Epipolar\nFocus Spectrum (EFS) representation by rearranging the EPI spectrum. Different\nfrom the classical EPI representation where an EPI line corresponds to a\nspecific depth, there is a one-to-one mapping from the EFS line to the view.\nAccordingly, compared to a sparsely-sampled light field, a densely-sampled one\nwith the same field of view (FoV) leads to a more compact distribution of such\nlinear structures in the double-cone-shaped region with the identical opening\nangle in its corresponding EFS. Hence the EFS representation is invariant to\nthe scene depth. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we develop a trainable\nEFS-based pipeline for light field reconstruction, where a dense light field\ncan be reconstructed by compensating the \"missing EFS lines\" given a sparse\nlight field, yielding promising results with cross-view consistency, especially\nin the presence of severe occlusion and large disparity. Experimental results\non both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the validity and\nsuperiority of the proposed method over SOTA methods.",

      "abstract": "It has recently become increasingly important to measure the cognitive load\nof developers. This is because continuing with a development under a high\ncognitive load may cause human errors. Therefore, to automatically measure the\ncognitive load, existing studies have used biometric measures such as brain\nwaves and the heart rate. However, developers are often required to equip\ncertain devices when measuring them, and can therefore be physically burdened.\nIn this study, we evaluated the feasibility of non-invasive biometric measures\nbased on the nasal skin temperature. The nasal skin temperature has been widely\nused in other fields to measure mental status. In the present experiment, the\nsubjects created small Java programs, and we estimated their cognitive load\nusing the proposed biometric measures based on the nasal skin temperature. As a\nresult, the proposed biometric measures were shown to be more effective than\nnon-biometric measures. Hence, biometric measures based on nasal skin\ntemperature are promising for estimating the cognitive load of developers.",

Meanwhile, the accuracy is limited with an assumption of\nsame change rate of population in all municipalities and within each city.\nTherefore, the aim of this study was to develop an agent-based microsimulation\nhousehold transition model, with the household as the unit and agent, and\nhousehold data was estimated for all cities in Japan from 2015. Estimated\nhousehold data comprised the family type, house type, and address, age, and\ngender of household members, obtained from the national census, and building\ndata. The resulting household transition model was used to forecast the\nattributes of each household every five years. Simulations in Toyama and\nShizuoka Prefectures, Japan from 1980 to 2010 provided highly accurate\nestimates of municipal-level population by age and household volume by family\ntype. The proposed model was also applied to predict the future distribution of\ndisappearing villages and vacant houses in Japan.",

In the presence of a magnetic field,\nthese QSH states persist up to a magnetic field equal to the critical field,\nbeyond which the edge states would consist of normal quantum Hall (QH) states.\nWe provide the expression of this critical field which is found consistent with\nsome previous literature. The critical field partitioned the spectrum into two\ntypes of quantum states, \\textit{viz}. , the Quantum spin Hall (QSH) and\nQuantum Hall (QH) states. We present a theoretical study of the\nmagnetotransport properties based on the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang Hamiltonian that\ndescribes these QSH states. Our results of the Hall conductivity show the\ndifferent responses at these two different topological regions. Around the low\nFermi energy level, the system has a high Hall conductivity in the QH region,\nwhile the same is less dominant in the QSH region. Our results of the Hall\nconductivity thus help differentiate the type topological phase of the given\nquantum well.",

To this end, a material database is constructed from the DIC\ndisplacement tracking measurements of multiple biaxial stretching protocols on\na porcine tricuspid valve anterior leaflet, with which we build a neural\noperator learning model. The material response is modeled as a solution\noperator from the loading to the resultant displacement field, with the\nmaterial microstructure properties learned implicitly from the data and\nnaturally embedded in the network parameters. Using various combinations of\nloading protocols, we compare the predictivity of this framework with finite\nelement analysis based on the phenomenological Fung-type model. From\nin-distribution tests, the predictivity of our approach presents good\ngeneralizability to different loading conditions and outperforms the\nconventional constitutive modeling at approximately one order of magnitude.\nWhen tested on out-of-distribution loading ratios, the neural operator learning\napproach becomes less effective. To improve the generalizability of our\nframework, we propose a physics-guided neural operator learning model via\nimposing partial physics knowledge. This method is shown to improve the model's\nextrapolative performance in the small-deformation regime. Our results\ndemonstrate that with sufficient data coverage and/or guidance from partial\nphysics constraints, the data-driven approach can be a more effective method\nfor modeling biological materials than the traditional constitutive modeling.",

Each player faces the cost of\ndelayed delivery (due to charging requirements of EVs) and a pollution cost\nlevied on the ICEVs. This cost structure models: 1) limited battery capacity of\nEVs and their charging requirement; 2) shared nature of charging facilities; 3)\npollution cost levied by regulatory agency on the use of ICEVs. We characterize\nNash equilibria of this game and derive a condition for its uniqueness. We also\nuse the gradient projection method to compute this equilibrium in a distributed\nmanner. Our equilibrium analysis is useful to analyze the trade-off faced by\nplayers in incurring higher delay due to congestion at charging locations when\nthe share of EVs increases versus a higher pollution cost when the share of\nICEVs increases. A numerical example suggests that to increase marginal\npollution cost can dramatically reduce inefficiency of equilibria.",

With the proposed loss, we\ntrain the neural separators based on minimum variance distortionless response\n(MVDR) beamforming and independent vector analysis (IVA). We also investigate\nthe effectiveness of combining our spatial loss and a signal loss, which uses\nthe outputs of blind source separation as the reference. We evaluate our\nproposed method on synthetic and recorded (LibriCSS) mixtures. We find that the\nspatial loss is most effective to train IVA-based separators. For the neural\nMVDR beamformer, it performs best when combined with a signal loss. On\nsynthetic mixtures, the proposed unsupervised loss leads to the same\nperformance as a supervised loss in terms of word error rate.

      "abstract": "In the uplink of multiuser multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) systems\noperating over aging channels, pilot spacing is crucial for acquiring channel\nstate information and achieving high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(SINR). Somewhat surprisingly, very few works examine the impact of pilot\nspacing on the correlation structure of subsequent channel estimates and the\nresulting quality of channel state information considering channel aging. In\nthis paper, we consider a fast-fading environment characterized by its\nexponentially decaying autocorrelation function, and model pilot spacing as a\nsampling problem to capture the inherent trade-off between the quality of\nchannel state information and the number of symbols available for information\ncarrying data symbols. We first establish a quasi-closed form for the\nachievable asymptotic deterministic equivalent SINR when the channel estimation\nalgorithm utilizes multiple pilot signals. Next, we establish upper bounds on\nthe achievable SINR and spectral efficiency, as a function of pilot spacing,\nwhich helps to find the optimum pilot spacing within a limited search space.\nOur key insight is that to maximize the achievable SINR and the spectral\nefficiency of MU-MIMO systems, proper pilot spacing must be applied to control\nthe impact of the aging channel and to tune the trade-off between pilot and\ndata symbols.",

Most\nexisting methods use a class activation map (CAM) to generate a localization\nmap; however, a CAM identifies only the most discriminative parts of a target\nobject rather than the entire object region. In this work, we find the gap\nbetween classification and localization in terms of the misalignment of the\ndirections between an input feature and a class-specific weight. We demonstrate\nthat the misalignment suppresses the activation of CAM in areas that are less\ndiscriminative but belong to the target object.

      "abstract": "In this manuscript, we construct generalized Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes in the\ncontext of $f(R)$ modified theories of gravity. We consider that the matter\ndriving the wormhole satisfies the energy conditions so that it is the\neffective energy-momentum tensor containing the higher-order derivatives of\ncurvature terms that violate the null energy condition. Thus, the gravitational\nfluid is interpreted by the higher-order derivatives of curvature terms to\nrepresent the wormhole geometries and is fundamentally different from its\ncounter representation in general relativity. In particular, we explore the\nwormhole geometries by presuming various well-known forms of Lagrangian $f(R)$.\nIn addition, for the seek of completeness, we discuss modified\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov, volume integral quantifier, and total gravitational\nenergy.",

SE focuses on\nimproving the auditory quality of speech, but the enhanced feature distribution\nis changed, which is uncertain and detrimental to the ASR. To tackle this\nchallenge, an approach with multiple confidence gates for jointly training of\nSE and ASR is proposed. A speech confidence gates prediction module is designed\nto replace the former SE module in joint training. The noisy speech is filtered\nby gates to obtain features that are easier to be fitting by the ASR network.\nThe experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance\nthan the traditional robust speech recognition system on test sets of clean\nspeech, synthesized noisy speech, and real noisy speech.",

In this\npaper, we investigate methods for sequentially reconstructing static\nenvironments from panoptic image segmentations in 3D. We specifically target\nreal-time operation: the algorithm must process data strictly online and be\nable to run at relatively fast frame rates. Additionally, the method should be\nscalable for environments large enough for practical applications. By applying\na simple but powerful data-association algorithm, we outperform earlier similar\nworks when operating purely online. Our method is also capable of reaching\nframe-rates high enough for real-time applications and is scalable to larger\nenvironments as well.

Due to the presence of high inertial\nparticles, the drastic reduction of shear production of turbulence is found to\nbe the main cause for the discontinuous attenuation of turbulence. In this\narticle, particle-phase statistics is explored. The two-way coupled DNS reveal\nthat the mean-square velocity profiles in cross-stream (y) and span-wise (z)\ndirections are flat and increase with $\\phi$ as the higher frequency of\ncollision helps in transferring streamwise momentum to span-wise and\nwall-normal directions. Whereas, streamwise fluctuations decrease and tend\nbecome flatter with increase in loading. In the regime with $\\phi>\\phi_{cr}$,\nthe particle velocity fluctuations drive the fluid phase velocity fluctuations.\nAdditionally it is observed that one-way coupled DNS and Fluctuating Force\nSimulation (FFS) [2] are capable to predict the particle phase statistics with\nreasonable accuracy in the regime $\\phi<\\phi_{cr}$ where wall-particle\ncollision time and inter-particle collision time is lesser than viscous\nrelaxation time of the particles. For, $\\phi>\\phi_{cr}$, a significant error in\nthe prediction from one-way coupled DNS and FFS is observed due to the\nlimitation of FFS in capturing the turbulence attenuation and the change in\nmean fluid velocity profile.

With a growing number of people depending on such\nplatforms to earn their livelihood, it is important to understand whether\ndifferent items are receiving their desired exposure. To this end, our\nexperiments on multiple real-world RIR datasets reveal that the existing RIR\nalgorithms often result in very skewed exposure distribution of items, and the\nquality of items is not a plausible explanation for such skew in exposure. To\nmitigate this exposure bias, we introduce multiple flexible interventions\n(FaiRIR) in the RIR pipeline. We instantiate these mechanisms with two\nwell-known algorithms for constructing related item recommendations --\nrating-SVD and item2vec -- and show on real-world data that our mechanisms\nallow for a fine-grained control on the exposure distribution, often at a small\nor no cost in terms of recommendation quality, measured in terms of relatedness\nand user satisfaction.",

      "abstract": "In the last years there has been a growing interest for nonlinear speech\nmodels. Several works have been published revealing the better performance of\nnonlinear techniques, but little attention has been dedicated to the\nimplementation of the nonlinear model into real applications. This work is\nfocused on the study of the behaviour of a combined linear/nonlinear predictive\nmodel based on linear predictive coding (LPC-10) and neural nets, in a speech\nwaveform coder. Our novel scheme obtains an improvement in SEGSNR between 1 and\n2.5 dB for an adaptive quantization ranging from 2 to 5 bits.",

The generalized Pipek-Mezey Wannier functions\nexhibit appealing characteristics (e.g., reaching an optimal localization and\nthe separation of the $\\sigma$-$\\pi$ orbitals) when compared with other\nschemes. However, when applied to giant nanoscale systems, the orbital\nlocalization suffers from a large computational cost overhead when one is\ninterested in localized states in a small fragment of the system. Herein we\npresent a swift, efficient, and robust approach for obtaining regionally\nlocalized orbitals of a subsystem within the generalized Pipek-Mezey scheme.\nThe proposed algorithm introduces a reduced workspace and sequentially exhausts\nthe entire orbital space until the convergence of the localization functional.\nIt tackles systems with $\\sim$10000 electrons within 0.5 hours with no loss in\nlocalization quality compared to the traditional approach. Regionally localized\norbitals with a higher extent of localization are obtained via judiciously\nextending the subsystem's size. Exemplifying on large bulk and a 4-nm wide slab\nof diamond with NV$^-$ center, we demonstrate the methodology and discuss how\nthe choice of the localization region affects the excitation energy of the\ndefect. Furthermore, we show how the sequential algorithm is easily extended to\nstochastic methodologies that do not provide individual single-particle\neigenstates.

First, the proposed KL-divergence based regularization is able to\nlead to a better question understanding for retrieval and answer reading.\nSecond, the added post-ranker module can push more relevant passages to the top\nplacements and be selected for reader with a two-aspect constrains. Third, the\nwell designed curriculum learning strategy effectively narrows the gap between\nthe golden passage settings of training and inference, and encourages the\nreader to find true answer without the golden passage assistance. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on the publicly available dataset OR-QuAC demonstrate the\nsuperiority of MICQA over the state-of-the-art model in conversational OpenQA\ntask.",

      "abstract": "Spatial extension has been hailed as a \"smoking gun\" in the gamma-ray search\nof dark galactic subhalos, which would appear as unidentified sources for\ngamma-ray telescopes. In this work, we study the sensitivity of the Fermi-LAT\nto extended subhalos using simulated data based on a realistic sky model. We\nsimulate spatial templates for a set of representative subhalos, whose\nparameters were derived from our previous work with N-body cosmological\nsimulation data. We find that detecting an extended subhalo and finding an\nunequivocal signal of angular extension requires, respectively, a flux 2 to 10\ntimes larger than in the case of a point-like source. By studying a large grid\nof models, where parameters such as the WIMP mass, annihilation channel or\nsubhalo model are varied significantly, we obtain the response of the LAT as a\nfunction of the product of annihilation cross section times the J-factor.\nIndeed, we show that spatial extension can be used as an additional filter to\nreject subhalos candidates among the pool of unidentified LAT sources, as well\nas a \"smoking gun\" for positive identification. For instance, typical angular\nextensions of a few tenths of degree are expected for the considered scenarios.\nFinally, we also study the impact of the obtained LAT sensitivity to such\nextended subhalos on the achievable dark matter constraints, which are a few\ntimes less constraining than comparable point-source limits.",

      "abstract": "The declared aim of Marvel Fusion is the realization of a reactor based on\nthe aneutronic fusion of proton and boron-11 nuclei in the near future, making\nuse of latest-day laser technology and nano-structured materials. The aim of\nthe preprint quoted above is to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion energy\ngain from the irradiation of an initially uncompressed target consisting of an\narray of nano-wires, by a femto-second laser. This proposal is in apparent\ncontrast to text-book wisdom, which postulates - even for the fast-ignitor\nconcept, and a DT fuel mix - a target density about 1000 times that of solid\nstate. The novel, optimistic predictions of Ruhl and Korn are based, however,\nnot on rigorous estimates, but only on parametric dependencies, extrapolated\nfar beyond their conventional limits of validity. The authors invoke the\neffects of self-arising magnetic fields to result in additional magnetic\nconfinement, but we show their model to contain intrinsic contradictions. The\nconclusion from out note is that ultra-fast, high power lasers can be of use to\ninertial fusion energy production only, if the intrinsic time-scale for fusion\nreactions can be brought down to a level more commensurate with the Laser pulse\nlength. Involving magnetic fields does not change this basic limitation, as the\nAlfv\\'en time will be similar to the kinetic disintegration time. Given that\nthe fusion energy gain as function of particle energy has a maximum (for DT at\nabout 170 keV) overheating will not be helpful so that the required enhancement\nof the fusion reaction rate can only be achieved by strong pre-compression of\nthe target.",

      "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) Prediction is of great importance in real-world\nonline ads systems. One challenge for the CTR prediction task is to capture the\nreal interest of users from their clicked items, which is inherently biased by\npresented positions of items, i.e., more front positions tend to obtain higher\nCTR values. A popular line of existing works focuses on explicitly estimating\nposition bias by result randomization which is expensive and inefficient, or by\ninverse propensity weighting (IPW) which relies heavily on the quality of the\npropensity estimation. Another common solution is modeling position as features\nduring offline training and simply adopting fixed value or dropout tricks when\nserving. However, training-inference inconsistency can lead to sub-optimal\nperformance. Furthermore, post-click information such as position values is\ninformative while less exploited in CTR prediction. This work proposes a simple\nyet efficient knowledge distillation framework to alleviate the impact of\nposition bias and leverage position information to improve CTR prediction. We\ndemonstrate the performance of our proposed method on a real-world production\ndataset and online A/B tests, achieving significant improvements over competing\nbaseline models.

Results demonstrate that the\nproposed framework increases the success rate on the swarm-guidance environment\nby 11% and better stability in return for a modest increase in computational\ncost of 14.5% to achieve interpretability.

      "abstract": "In classical planning, the goal is to derive a course of actions that allows\nan intelligent agent to move from any situation it finds itself in to one that\nsatisfies its goals. Classical planning is considered domain-independent, i.e.,\nit is not limited to a particular application and can be used to solve\ndifferent types of reasoning problems. In practice, however, some properties of\na planning problem at hand require an expressive extension of the standard\nclassical planning formalism to capture and model them. Although the importance\nof many of these extensions is well known, most planners, especially optimal\nplanners, do not support these extended planning formalisms. The lack of\nsupport not only limits the use of these planners for certain problems, but\neven if it is possible to model the problems without these extensions, it often\nleads to increased effort in modeling or makes modeling practically impossible\nas the required problem encoding size increases exponentially.\n  In this thesis, we propose to use symbolic search for cost-optimal planning\nfor different expressive extensions of classical planning, all capturing\ndifferent aspects of the problem. In particular, we study planning with axioms,\nplanning with state-dependent action costs, oversubscription planning, and\ntop-k planning. For all formalisms, we present complexity and compilability\nresults, highlighting that it is desirable and even necessary to natively\nsupport the corresponding features. We analyze symbolic heuristic search and\nshow that the search performance does not always benefit from the use of a\nheuristic and that the search performance can exponentially deteriorate even\nunder the best possible circumstances, namely the perfect heuristic. This\nreinforces that symbolic blind search is the dominant symbolic search strategy\nnowadays, on par with other state-of-the-art cost-optimal planning\nstrategies...",

      "abstract": "Few-Shot classification aims at solving problems that only a few samples are\navailable in the training process. Due to the lack of samples, researchers\ngenerally employ a set of training tasks from other domains to assist the\ntarget task, where the distribution between assistant tasks and the target task\nis usually different. To reduce the distribution gap, several lines of methods\nhave been proposed, such as data augmentation and domain alignment. However,\none common drawback of these algorithms is that they ignore the similarity task\nselection before training. The fundamental problem is to push the auxiliary\ntasks close to the target task. In this paper, we propose a novel task\nselecting algorithm, named Optimal Transport Task Selecting (OTTS), to\nconstruct a training set by selecting similar tasks for Few-Shot learning.\nSpecifically, the OTTS measures the task similarity by calculating the optimal\ntransport distance and completes the model training via a self-supervised\nstrategy. By utilizing the selected tasks with OTTS, the training process of\nFew-Shot learning become more stable and effective. Other proposed methods\nincluding data augmentation and domain alignment can be used in the meantime\nwith OTTS. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, including\nMiniImageNet, CIFAR, CUB, Cars, and Places, to evaluate the effectiveness of\nOTTS.

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the main problem of deep learning techniques used in the\ndevelopment of automatic speech recognition (ASR) models is the lack of\ntranscribed data. The goal of this research is to propose a new data\naugmentation method to improve ASR models for agglutinative and low-resource\nlanguages. This novel data augmentation method generates both synthetic text\nand synthetic audio. Some experiments were conducted using the corpus of the\nQuechua language, which is an agglutinative and low-resource language. In this\nstudy, a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model was applied to generate synthetic\ntext, in addition to generating synthetic speech using a text-to-speech (TTS)\nmodel for Quechua. The results show that the new data augmentation method works\nwell to improve the ASR model for Quechua. In this research, an 8.73%\nimprovement in the word-error-rate (WER) of the ASR model is obtained using a\ncombination of synthetic text and synthetic speech.",

      "title": "Preventing Distillation-based Attacks on Neural Network IP",
      "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) are already deployed in hardware today, becoming\nvaluable intellectual property (IP) as many hours are invested in their\ntraining and optimization. Therefore, attackers may be interested in copying,\nreverse engineering, or even modifying this IP. The current practices in\nhardware obfuscation, including the widely studied logic locking technique, are\ninsufficient to protect the actual IP of a well-trained NN: its weights. Simply\nhiding the weights behind a key-based scheme is inefficient (resource-hungry)\nand inadequate (attackers can exploit knowledge distillation). This paper\nproposes an intuitive method to poison the predictions that prevent\ndistillation-based attacks; this is the first work to consider such a poisoning\napproach in hardware-implemented NNs. The proposed technique obfuscates a NN so\nan attacker cannot train the NN entirely or accurately. We elaborate a threat\nmodel which highlights the difference between random logic obfuscation and the\nobfuscation of NN IP. Based on this threat model, our security analysis shows\nthat the poisoning successfully and significantly reduces the accuracy of the\nstolen NN model on various representative datasets. Moreover, the accuracy and\nprediction distributions are maintained, no functionality is disturbed, nor are\nhigh overheads incurred. Finally, we highlight that our proposed approach is\nflexible and does not require manipulation of the NN toolchain.",

      "abstract": "The dependence of the actual/effective ionic concentration on the nominal\nsalt concentration is experimentally investigated for aqueous solutions of NaCl\nand KCl.

A second one via extraction of the ionic density from\nsimultaneously fitting of the real and imaginary parts of the impedance\nspectrum by using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model.

      "abstract": "Semiconductor nanocrystals, quantum dots, are known to exhibit the\nquantum-confined Stark effect which reveals itself in the shift of their\nphotoluminescence spectra in response to external electric field. It was,\ntherefore, proposed to use quantum dots deposited on the microparticle surface\nfor the optical measurement of the charge acquired by the microparticles in\nlow-temperature plasmas. Thermal balance of a quantum dot residing on the\nsurface of a microparticle immersed in a plasma is considered in this work. It\nis shown for typical plasma parameters that under periodically pulsed plasma\nconditions, the spectral shift of the photoluminescence of the quantum dot\ncaused by the oscillations of its temperature becomes undetectable at the\neffective thermal flux characterizing the thermal contact between the quantum\ndot and the microparticle $\\sim 10^9$~s$^{-1}$. Under these conditions, the\nentire spectral shift observed during the period of plasma pulsing should be\nattributed to the quantum-confined Stark effect due to the microparticle\ncharge. Lower-boundary estimate for the effective thermal flux for the direct\ncontact between the quantum dot and the microparticle is $\\sim\n10^{12}$~s$^{-1}$.",

      "abstract": "Learning from a label distribution has achieved promising results on ordinal\nregression tasks such as facial age and head pose estimation wherein, the\nconcept of adaptive label distribution learning (ALDL) has drawn lots of\nattention recently for its superiority in theory. However, compared with the\nmethods assuming fixed form label distribution, ALDL methods have not achieved\nbetter performance. We argue that existing ALDL algorithms do not fully exploit\nthe intrinsic properties of ordinal regression. In this paper, we emphatically\nsummarize that learning an adaptive label distribution on ordinal regression\ntasks should follow three principles. First, the probability corresponding to\nthe ground-truth should be the highest in label distribution. Second, the\nprobabilities of neighboring labels should decrease with the increase of\ndistance away from the ground-truth, i.e., the distribution is unimodal. Third,\nthe label distribution should vary with samples changing, and even be distinct\nfor different instances with the same label, due to the different levels of\ndifficulty and ambiguity. Under the premise of these principles, we propose a\nnovel loss function for fully adaptive label distribution learning, namely\nunimodal-concentrated loss. Specifically, the unimodal loss derived from the\nlearning to rank strategy constrains the distribution to be unimodal.\nFurthermore, the estimation error and the variance of the predicted\ndistribution for a specific sample are integrated into the proposed\nconcentrated loss to make the predicted distribution maximize at the\nground-truth and vary according to the predicting uncertainty. Extensive\nexperimental results on typical ordinal regression tasks including age and head\npose estimation, show the superiority of our proposed unimodal-concentrated\nloss compared with existing loss functions.",

      "abstract": "We are concerned with a special form of the (stochastic) Allen-Cahn equation,\nwhich can be seen as a model of hybrid zones in population genetics.\nIndividuals in the population can be of one of three types; $aa$ are fitter\nthan $AA$, and both are fitter than the $aA$ heterozygotes. The hybrid zone is\nthe region separating a subpopulation consisting entirely of $aa$ individuals\nfrom one consisting of $AA$ individuals. We investigate the interplay between\nthe motion of the hybrid zone and the shape of the habitat, both with and\nwithout genetic drift (corresponding to stochastic and deterministic models\nrespectively). In the deterministic model, we investigate the effect of a wide\nopening and provide some explicit sufficient conditions under which the spread\nof the advantageous type is halted, and complementary conditions under which it\nsweeps through the whole population. As a standing example, we are interested\nin the outcome of the advantageous population passing through an isthmus. We\nalso identify rather precise conditions under which genetic drift breaks down\nthe structure of the hybrid zone, complementing previous work that identified\nconditions on the strength of genetic drift under which the structure of the\nhybrid zone is preserved.\n  Our results demonstrate that, even in cylindrical domains, it can be\nmisleading to caricature allele frequencies by one-dimensional travelling\nwaves, and that the strength of genetic drift plays an important role in\ndetermining the fate of a favoured allele.",

      "abstract": "In autonomous driving, LiDAR point-clouds and RGB images are two major data\nmodalities with complementary cues for 3D object detection. However, it is\nquite difficult to sufficiently use them, due to large inter-modal\ndiscrepancies. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, namely\nContrastively Augmented Transformer for multi-modal 3D object Detection\n(CAT-Det). Specifically, CAT-Det adopts a two-stream structure consisting of a\nPointformer (PT) branch, an Imageformer (IT) branch along with a Cross-Modal\nTransformer (CMT) module. PT, IT and CMT jointly encode intra-modal and\ninter-modal long-range contexts for representing an object, thus fully\nexploring multi-modal information for detection. Furthermore, we propose an\neffective One-way Multi-modal Data Augmentation (OMDA) approach via\nhierarchical contrastive learning at both the point and object levels,\nsignificantly improving the accuracy only by augmenting point-clouds, which is\nfree from complex generation of paired samples of the two modalities. Extensive\nexperiments on the KITTI benchmark show that CAT-Det achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art, highlighting its effectiveness.",

      "title": "Diverse Preference Augmentation with Multiple Domains for Cold-start\n  Recommendations",
      "abstract": "Cold-start issues have been more and more challenging for providing accurate\nrecommendations with the fast increase of users and items. Most existing\napproaches attempt to solve the intractable problems via content-aware\nrecommendations based on auxiliary information and/or cross-domain\nrecommendations with transfer learning. Their performances are often\nconstrained by the extremely sparse user-item interactions, unavailable side\ninformation, or very limited domain-shared users. Recently, meta-learners with\nmeta-augmentation by adding noises to labels have been proven to be effective\nto avoid overfitting and shown good performance on new tasks. Motivated by the\nidea of meta-augmentation, in this paper, by treating a user's preference over\nitems as a task, we propose a so-called Diverse Preference Augmentation\nframework with multiple source domains based on meta-learning (referred to as\nMetaDPA) to i) generate diverse ratings in a new domain of interest (known as\ntarget domain) to handle overfitting on the case of sparse interactions, and to\nii) learn a preference model in the target domain via a meta-learning scheme to\nalleviate cold-start issues. Specifically, we first conduct multi-source domain\nadaptation by dual conditional variational autoencoders and impose a\nMulti-domain InfoMax (MDI) constraint on the latent representations to learn\ndomain-shared and domain-specific preference properties. To avoid overfitting,\nwe add a Mutually-Exclusive (ME) constraint on the output of decoders to\ngenerate diverse ratings given content data. Finally, these generated diverse\nratings and the original ratings are introduced into the meta-training\nprocedure to learn a preference meta-learner, which produces good\ngeneralization ability on cold-start recommendation tasks. Experiments on\nreal-world datasets show our proposed MetaDPA clearly outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

This finite observable is\nclosely related to the Amplituhedron, and it is reminiscent of finite parts of\nplanar two-loop five-particle scattering amplitudes. We verify that, up to this\nloop order, the leading singularities are given by the same conformally\ninvariant expressions that appear in all-plus pure Yang-Mills amplitudes. The\naccompanying weight-four transcendental functions are expressed in terms of the\npentagon functions space known from planar two-loop five-particle amplitudes,\nbut interestingly only a subset of the functions appears. Being a function of\nfour dimensionless variables, the observable has interesting asymptotic limits.\nWe verify that our analytic result is consistent with soft and collinear\nlimits, and find an intriguingly simple pattern in the multi-Regge limit.\nThanks to the new result we can also conjecturally predict, for general\nkinematics, the maximal weight piece of the planar three-loop five-particle\nall-plus amplitude in pure Yang-Mills theory. Motivated by the Amplituhedron\ngeometry, we investigate positivity properties of the integrated answer.\nGeneralizing previous results at four particles, we find numerical evidence\nthat the two-loop five-particle result has uniform sign in a kinematic region\nsuggested by the loop Amplituhedron.",

      "abstract": "The aim of reinforcement learning (RL) is to allow the agent to achieve the\nfinal goal. Most RL studies have focused on improving the efficiency of\nlearning to achieve the final goal faster. However, the RL model is very\ndifficult to modify an intermediate route in the process of reaching the final\ngoal. That is, the agent cannot be under control to achieve other sub-goals in\nthe existing studies. If the agent can go through the sub-goals on the way to\nthe destination, the RL can be applied and studied in various fields. In this\nstudy, I propose a methodology to achieve the user-defined sub-goals as well as\nthe final goal using memory editing. The memory editing is performed to\ngenerate various sub-goals and give an additional reward to the agent. In\naddition, the sub-goals are separately learned from the final goal. I set two\nsimple environments and various scenarios in the test environments. As a\nresult, the agent almost successfully passed the sub-goals as well as the final\ngoal under control. Moreover, the agent was able to be induced to visit the\nnovel state indirectly in the environments. I expect that this methodology can\nbe used in the fields that need to control the agent in a variety of scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Grant-free protocols exploiting compressed sensing (CS) multi-user detection\n(MUD) are appealing for solving the random access problem in massive\nmachine-type communications (mMTC) with sporadic device activity. Such\nprotocols would greatly benefit from a prior deterministic knowledge of the\nsparsity level, i.e., instantaneous number of simultaneously active devices\n$K$. Aiming at this, herein we introduce a framework relying on coordinated\npilot transmissions (CPT) over a short phase at the beginning of the\ntransmission block for detecting $K$ in mMTC scenarios under Rayleigh fading.\nCPT can be implemented either as: i) U-CPT, which exploits only uplink\ntransmissions, or A-CPT, which includes also downlink transmissions for channel\nstate information (CSI) acquisition that resolve fading uncertainty. We discuss\ntwo specific implementations of A-CPT: ii) A-CPT-F, which implements CSI-based\nphase corrections while leveraging the same statistical inverse power control\nused by U-CPT, and iii) A-CPT-D, which implements a dynamic CSI-based inverse\npower control, although it requires some active devices to remain in silence if\ntheir corresponding channels are too faded. We derive a signal sparsity level\ndetector for each CPT mechanism by relaxing the original integer\ndetection/classification problem to an estimation problem in the continuous\nreal domain followed by a rounding operation. We show that the variance of the\nrelaxed estimator increases with $K^2$ and $K$ when operating with U-CPT and\nA-CPT mechanisms, respectively. The distribution of the estimators under U-CPT,\nA-CPT-F and A-CPT-D is found to follow an exponential, Gaussian, and Student's\n$t-$like distribution, respectively. Analyses evince the superiority of\nA-CPT-D, which is also corroborated via numerical results. We reveal several\ninteresting trade-offs and highlight potential research directions.",

The joint network expands LISA's horizon\ntowards lower mass end, where the event rate is high, so we have better chance\nobserving primordial black holes with the joint network.

      "abstract": "Frequency control plays a pivotal role in reliable power system operations.\nIt is conventionally performed in a hierarchical way that first rapidly\nstabilizes the frequency deviations and then slowly recovers the nominal\nfrequency. However, as the generation mix shifts from synchronous generators to\nrenewable resources, power systems experience larger and faster frequency\nfluctuations due to the loss of inertia, which adversely impacts the frequency\nstability. This has motivated active research in algorithms that jointly\naddress frequency degradation and economic efficiency in a fast timescale,\namong which the distributed averaging-based integral (DAI) control is a notable\none that sets controllable power injections directly proportional to the\nintegrals of frequency deviation and economic inefficiency signals.\nNevertheless, DAI do not typically consider the transient performance of the\nsystem following power disturbances and has been restricted to quadratic\noperational cost functions. This manuscript aims to leverage nonlinear optimal\ncontrollers to simultaneously achieve optimal transient frequency control and\nfind the most economic power dispatch for frequency restoration. To this end,\nwe integrate reinforcement learning (RL) to the classic DAI, which results in\nRL-DAI. Specifically, we use RL to learn a neural network-based control policy\nmapping from the integral variables of DAI to the controllable power injections\nwhich provides optimal transient frequency control, while DAI inherently\nensures the frequency restoration and optimal economic dispatch. Compared to\nexisting methods, we provide provable guarantees on the stability of the\nlearned controllers and extend allowable cost functions to a much larger class.\nSimulations on the 39-bus New England system illustrate our results.",

      "abstract": "Quantum information stored in a qubit is rapidly lost to the environment. The\nrealization of robust qubits is one of the most important challenges in quantum\ncomputing. Herein we propose to embed a logical qubit within the manifold of a\nqudit as a scheme to preserve quantum information over extended periods of\ntime. Under identical conditions (e.g. decoherence channels) the submanifold of\nthe logical qubit exhibits extended lifetimes compared to a pure two-level\nsystem (qubit). The retention of quantum information further improves with\nseparation between the sublevels of the logical qubit. Lifetime enhancement can\nbe understood in terms of entropy production of the encoding and non-encoding\nsubspaces during evolution under a quantum map for a $d$-level system. The\nadditional pathways for coherent evolution through intermediate sublevels\nwithin a $d$-level manifold provide an information-preserving mechanism:\nreversible alternative channels to the irreversible loss of information to the\nenvironment characteristic of open quantum systems.",

      "title": "Production of polarized particle beams via ultraintense laser pulses",
      "abstract": "High-energy spin-polarized electron, positron, and $\\gamma$-photon beams have\nmany significant applications in the study of material properties, nuclear\nstructure, particle physics, and high-energy astrophysics. Thus,efficient\nproduction of such polarized beams attracts a broad spectrum of research\ninterests. This is driven mainly by the rapid advancements in ultrashort and\nultraintense laser technology. Currently available laser pulses can achieve\npeak intensities in the range of $10^{22}-10^{23}$ Wcm$^{-2}$, with pulse\ndurations of tens of femtoseconds. The dynamics of particles in laser fields of\nthe available intensities is dominated by quantum electrodynamics (QED) and the\ninteraction mechanisms have reached regimes spanned by nonlinear multiphoton\nabsorbtion (strong-field QED processes). In strong-field QED processes, the\nscattering cross sections obviously depend on the spin and polarization of the\nparticles, and the spin-dependent photon emission and the radiation-reaction\neffects can be utilized to produce the polarized particles. An ultraintense\nlaser-driven polarized particle source possesses the advantages of\nhigh-brilliance and compactness, which could open the way for the unexplored\naspects in a range of researches. In this work, we briefly review the seminal\nconclusions from the study of the polarization effects in strong-field QED\nprocesses, as well as the progress made by recent proposals for production of\nthe polarized particles by laser-beam or laser-plasma interactions.",

      "abstract": "Visual Dialog aims to answer multi-round, interactive questions based on the\ndialog history and image content. Existing methods either consider answer\nranking and generating individually or only weakly capture the relation across\nthe two tasks implicitly by two separate models. The research on a universal\nframework that jointly learns to rank and generate answers in a single model is\nseldom explored. In this paper, we propose a contrastive learning-based\nframework UTC to unify and facilitate both discriminative and generative tasks\nin visual dialog with a single model. Specifically, considering the inherent\nlimitation of the previous learning paradigm, we devise two inter-task\ncontrastive losses i.e., context contrastive loss and answer contrastive loss\nto make the discriminative and generative tasks mutually reinforce each other.\nThese two complementary contrastive losses exploit dialog context and target\nanswer as anchor points to provide representation learning signals from\ndifferent perspectives. We evaluate our proposed UTC on the VisDial v1.0\ndataset, where our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on both\ndiscriminative and generative tasks and surpasses previous state-of-the-art\ngenerative methods by more than 2 absolute points on Recall@1.",

      "abstract": "Program classification can be regarded as a high-level abstraction of code,\nlaying a foundation for various tasks related to source code comprehension, and\nhas a very wide range of applications in the field of software engineering,\nsuch as code clone detection, code smell classification, defects\nclassification, etc. The cross-language program classification can realize code\ntransfer in different programming languages, and can also promote\ncross-language code reuse, thereby helping developers to write code quickly and\nreduce the development time of code transfer. Most of the existing studies\nfocus on the semantic learning of the code, whilst few studies are devoted to\ncross-language tasks. The main challenge of cross-language program\nclassification is how to extract semantic features of different programming\nlanguages. In order to cope with this difficulty, we propose a Unified Abstract\nSyntax Tree (namely UAST in this paper) neural network. In detail, the core\nidea of UAST consists of two unified mechanisms. First, UAST learns an AST\nrepresentation by unifying the AST traversal sequence and graph-like AST\nstructure for capturing semantic code features. Second, we construct a\nmechanism called unified vocabulary, which can reduce the feature gap between\ndifferent programming languages, so it can achieve the role of cross-language\nprogram classification. Besides, we collect a dataset containing 20,000 files\nof five programming languages, which can be used as a benchmark dataset for the\ncross-language program classification task. We have done experiments on two\ndatasets, and the results show that our proposed approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines in terms of four evaluation metrics (Precision,\nRecall, F1-score, and Accuracy).",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have largely promoted\nthe performance of adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC). Nevertheless,\nregarding the implementation, most works are cumbersome in terms of storage and\ncomputation. This hinders their deployment on scenarios where resources are\nlimited. In this work, we propose TinyLight, the first DRL-based ATSC model\nthat is designed for devices with extremely limited resources. TinyLight first\nconstructs a super-graph to associate a rich set of candidate features with a\ngroup of light-weighted network blocks. Then, to diminish the model's resource\nconsumption, we ablate edges in the super-graph automatically with a novel\nentropy-minimized objective function. This enables TinyLight to work on a\nstandalone microcontroller with merely 2KB RAM and 32KB ROM. We evaluate\nTinyLight on multiple road networks with real-world traffic demands.\nExperiments show that even with extremely limited resources, TinyLight still\nachieves competitive performance.

      "abstract": "Individual agents in natural systems like flocks of birds or schools of fish\ndisplay a remarkable ability to coordinate and communicate in local groups and\nexecute a variety of tasks efficiently. Emulating such natural systems into\ndrone swarms to solve problems in defence, agriculture, industry automation and\nhumanitarian relief is an emerging technology. However, flocking of aerial\nrobots while maintaining multiple objectives, like collision avoidance, high\nspeed etc. is still a challenge. In this paper, optimized flocking of drones in\na confined environment with multiple conflicting objectives is proposed. The\nconsidered objectives are collision avoidance (with each other and the wall),\nspeed, correlation, and communication (connected and disconnected agents).\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for dimensionality reduction, and\nunderstanding the collective dynamics of the swarm. The control model is\ncharacterised by 12 parameters which are then optimized using a multi-objective\nsolver (NSGA-II). The obtained results are reported and compared with that of\nthe CMA-ES algorithm.

      "abstract": "Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) technology aims to tackle the challenge of\nrestoring the degraded underwater images due to light absorption and\nscattering. To address problems, a novel U-Net based Reinforced Swin-Convs\nTransformer for the Underwater Image Enhancement method (URSCT-UIE) is\nproposed. Specifically, with the deficiency of U-Net based on pure\nconvolutions, we embedded the Swin Transformer into U-Net for improving the\nability to capture the global dependency. Then, given the inadequacy of the\nSwin Transformer capturing the local attention, the reintroduction of\nconvolutions may capture more local attention. Thus, we provide an ingenious\nmanner for the fusion of convolutions and the core attention mechanism to build\na Reinforced Swin-Convs Transformer Block (RSCTB) for capturing more local\nattention, which is reinforced in the channel and the spatial attention of the\nSwin Transformer. Finally, the experimental results on available datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed URSCT-UIE achieves state-of-the-art performance\ncompared with other methods in terms of both subjective and objective\nevaluations.

      "abstract": "We revisit classic string problems considered in the area of parameterized\ncomplexity, and study them through the lens of dynamic data structures. That\nis, instead of asking for a static algorithm that solves the given instance\nefficiently, our goal is to design a data structure that efficiently maintains\na solution, or reports a lack thereof, upon updates in the instance.\n  We first consider the Closest String problem, for which we design randomized\ndynamic data structures with amortized update times $d^{\\mathcal{O}(d)}$ and\n$|\\Sigma|^{\\mathcal{O}(d)}$, respectively, where $\\Sigma$ is the alphabet and\n$d$ is the assumed bound on the maximum distance. These are obtained by\ncombining known static approaches to Closest String with color-coding.\n  Next, we note that from a result of Frandsen et al.~[J. ACM'97] one can\neasily infer a meta-theorem that provides dynamic data structures for\nparameterized string problems with worst-case update time of the form\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log \\log n)$, where $k$ is the parameter in question and $n$ is\nthe length of the string. We showcase the utility of this meta-theorem by\ngiving such data structures for problems Disjoint Factors and Edit Distance. We\nalso give explicit data structures for these problems, with worst-case update\ntimes $\\mathcal{O}(k2^{k}\\log \\log n)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(k^2\\log \\log n)$,\nrespectively. Finally, we discuss how a lower bound methodology introduced by\nAmarilli et al.~[ICALP'21] can be used to show that obtaining update time\n$\\mathcal{O}(f(k))$ for Disjoint Factors and Edit Distance is unlikely already\nfor a constant value of the parameter $k$.",

These properties are of importance, e.g.,\nin the modularization of logical theories. We study interpolation in the\ncontext of coalgebraic modal logics, i.e. modal logics axiomatized in rank 1,\nrestricting for clarity to the case with finitely many modalities. Examples of\nsuch logics include the modal logics K and KD, neighbourhood logic and its\nmonotone variant, finite-monoid-weighted logics, and coalition logic. We\nintroduce a notion of one-step (uniform) interpolation, which refers only to a\nrestricted logic without nesting of modalities, and show that a coalgebraic\nmodal logic has uniform interpolation if it has one-step interpolation.\nMoreover, we identify preservation of finite surjective weak pullbacks as a\nsufficient, and in the monotone case necessary, condition for one-step\ninterpolation. We thus prove or reprove uniform interpolation for most of the\nexamples listed above.",

      "abstract": "Causal inference methods that control for text-based confounders are becoming\nincreasingly important in the social sciences and other disciplines where text\nis readily available. However, these methods rely on a critical assumption that\nthere is no treatment leakage: that is, the text only contains information\nabout the confounder and no information about treatment assignment. When this\nassumption does not hold, methods that control for text to adjust for\nconfounders face the problem of post-treatment (collider) bias. However, the\nassumption that there is no treatment leakage may be unrealistic in real-world\nsituations involving text, as human language is rich and flexible. Language\nappearing in a public policy document or health records may refer to the future\nand the past simultaneously, and thereby reveal information about the treatment\nassignment.\n  In this article, we define the treatment-leakage problem, and discuss the\nidentification as well as the estimation challenges it raises. Second, we\ndelineate the conditions under which leakage can be addressed by removing the\ntreatment-related signal from the text in a pre-processing step we define as\ntext distillation. Lastly, using simulation, we show how treatment leakage\nintroduces a bias in estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE) and how\ntext distillation can mitigate this bias.",

This shift in perspective\nreflects into a formal transition from the syntactic, graph-theoretic\ncompositionality of traditional Feynman diagrams to a semantic,\ncategorical-diagrammatic compositionality.\n  Because we work in a concrete categorical setting -- powered by non-standard\nanalysis -- we are able to take direct advantage of complex additive structure\nin our description.

Researchers\nhave resorted to soft bodies to investigate Artificial Life (ALife)-related\nquestions; similarly, a new era of soft-bodied robots has just begun.\nNevertheless, because of their infinite degrees of freedom, soft bodies pose\nunique challenges in terms of simulation, control, and optimization. Here we\npropose a novel soft-bodied agents formalism, namely Pressure-based Soft Agents\n(PSAs): they are bodies of gas enveloped by a chain of springs and masses, with\npressure pushing on the masses from inside the body. Pressure endows the agents\nwith structure, while springs and masses simulate softness and allow the agents\nto assume a large gamut of shapes. Actuation takes place by changing the length\nof springs or modulating global pressure. We optimize the controller of PSAs\nfor a locomotion task on hilly terrain and an escape task from a cage; the\nlatter is particularly suitable for soft-bodied agents, as it requires the\nagent to contort itself to squeeze through a small aperture. Our results\nsuggest that PSAs are indeed effective at those tasks and that controlling\npressure is fundamental for shape-changing. Looking forward, we envision PSAs\nto play a role in the modeling of soft-bodied agents, including soft robots and\nbiological cells.

      "abstract": "The Jesuit missions in South America were an important and unique advance in\nChristian evangelisation on the continent until the expulsion of the Order in\n1767. Although the history and cultural aspects of these missions and their\nmost iconic buildings have been extensively studied, the archaeoastronomy of\nthe Guaran\\'i peoples of the Province of Paraquaria (Province of Paraguay) has\nonly been recently considered, with the existing studies focusing primarily on\nthe orientation of their churches. The paper presented here, which is the first\narchaeoastronomical study of the Jesuit missions of Chiquitos in eastern\nBolivia, is an attempt to continue and complement the previous\narchaeoastronomical studies of the region. The methodologies employed involved\nthe analysis of the Jesuit churches that currently exist in this region,\nnamely, the on-site measurements of the orientations of eight churches\ncurrently standing and the ruins of a ninth church of which only a\nfree-standing bell tower and parts of the side walls remain preserved. The\norientation measurements of a tenth church, which we were unable to visit, were\ndetermined via the use of satellite maps. The landscape surrounding these\nchurches was then examined in detail and furthermore, a detailed cultural and\nhistorical study of the characteristics of the villages where the churches are\nlocated was carried out. Our results show that, unlike the churches of the\nProvince of Paraquaria where meridian orientations in the north-south direction\nstand out, half of the studied churches have shown potential canonical\norientations that seem to be aligned to solar phenomena, with three exhibiting\nprecise equinoctial orientation. We propose reasons for these orientations,\nincluding the possible relevance of illumination effects on significant\ninternal elements within the churches - effects that were generally sought in\nBaroque church architecture.",

      "abstract": "Document-level relation extraction (RE) aims at extracting relations among\nentities expressed across multiple sentences, which can be viewed as a\nmulti-label classification problem. In a typical document, most entity pairs do\nnot express any pre-defined relation and are labeled as \"none\" or \"no\nrelation\". For good document-level RE performance, it is crucial to distinguish\nsuch none class instances (entity pairs) from those of pre-defined classes\n(relations). However, most existing methods only estimate the probability of\npre-defined relations independently without considering the probability of \"no\nrelation\". This ignores the context of entity pairs and the label correlations\nbetween the none class and pre-defined classes, leading to sub-optimal\npredictions. To address this problem, we propose a new multi-label loss that\nencourages large margins of label confidence scores between each pre-defined\nclass and the none class, which enables captured label correlations and\ncontext-dependent thresholding for label prediction. To gain further robustness\nagainst positive-negative imbalance and mislabeled data that could appear in\nreal-world RE datasets, we propose a margin regularization and a margin\nshifting technique. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms existing multi-label losses for document-level RE and\nworks well in other multi-label tasks such as emotion classification when none\nclass instances are available for training.",

A categorical equivalence is\nestablished between the category of pointed semibiproducts of monoids and the\ncategory of pointed monoid action systems, a new category of actions that\nemerges from the equivalence. The main difference to classical extension theory\nis that semibiproduct extensions are treated in the same way as split\nextensions, even though the section map may fail to be a homomorphism.

      "abstract": "In real life, acoustic scenes and audio events are naturally correlated.\nHumans instinctively rely on fine-grained audio events as well as the overall\nsound characteristics to distinguish diverse acoustic scenes. Yet, most\nprevious approaches treat acoustic scene classification (ASC) and audio event\nclassification (AEC) as two independent tasks. A few studies on scene and event\njoint classification either use synthetic audio datasets that hardly match the\nreal world, or simply use the multi-task framework to perform two tasks at the\nsame time. Neither of these two ways makes full use of the implicit and\ninherent relation between fine-grained events and coarse-grained scenes. To\nthis end, this paper proposes a relation-guided ASC (RGASC) model to further\nexploit and coordinate the scene-event relation for the mutual benefit of scene\nand event recognition. The TUT Urban Acoustic Scenes 2018 dataset (TUT2018) is\nannotated with pseudo labels of events by a simple and efficient audio-related\npre-trained model PANN, which is one of the state-of-the-art AEC models. Then,\na prior scene-event relation matrix is defined as the average probability of\nthe presence of each event type in each scene class. Finally, the two-tower\nRGASC model is jointly trained on the real-life dataset TUT2018 for both scene\nand event classification. The following results are achieved. 1) RGASC\neffectively coordinates the true information of coarse-grained scenes and the\npseudo information of fine-grained events. 2) The event embeddings learned from\npseudo labels under the guidance of prior scene-event relations help reduce the\nconfusion between similar acoustic scenes. 3) Compared with other\n(non-ensemble) methods, RGASC improves the scene classification accuracy on the\nreal-life dataset.",

These models are trained on datasets annotated by human raters.\nWe explore how raters' self-described identities impact how they annotate\ntoxicity in online comments. We first define the concept of specialized rater\npools: rater pools formed based on raters' self-described identities, rather\nthan at random. We formed three such rater pools for this study--specialized\nrater pools of raters from the U.S. who identify as African American, LGBTQ,\nand those who identify as neither. Each of these rater pools annotated the same\nset of comments, which contains many references to these identity groups. We\nfound that rater identity is a statistically significant factor in how raters\nwill annotate toxicity for identity-related annotations. Using preliminary\ncontent analysis, we examined the comments with the most disagreement between\nrater pools and found nuanced differences in the toxicity annotations. Next, we\ntrained models on the annotations from each of the different rater pools, and\ncompared the scores of these models on comments from several test sets.\nFinally, we discuss how using raters that self-identify with the subjects of\ncomments can create more inclusive machine learning models, and provide more\nnuanced ratings than those by random raters.",

      "abstract": "Video-based action recognition is one of the most popular topics in computer\nvision. With recent advances of selfsupervised video representation learning\napproaches, action recognition usually follows a two-stage training framework,\ni.e., self-supervised pre-training on large-scale unlabeled sets and transfer\nlearning on a downstream labeled set. However, catastrophic forgetting of the\npre-trained knowledge becomes the main issue in the downstream transfer\nlearning of action recognition, resulting in a sub-optimal solution. In this\npaper, to alleviate the above issue, we propose a novel transfer learning\napproach that combines self-distillation in fine-tuning to preserve knowledge\nfrom the pre-trained model learned from the large-scale dataset. Specifically,\nwe fix the encoder from the last epoch as the teacher model to guide the\ntraining of the encoder from the current epoch in the transfer learning. With\nsuch a simple yet effective learning strategy, we outperform state-of-the-art\nmethods on widely used UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets in action recognition task.",

However, estimating model\nparameters from global image features may lead to noticeable misalignment\nbetween the estimated meshes and image evidence. To address this issue and\nleverage the best of both worlds, we propose a framework of three consecutive\nmodules. A dense map prediction module explicitly establishes the dense UV\ncorrespondence between the image evidence and each part of the body model. The\ninverse kinematics module refines the key point prediction and generates a\nposed template mesh. Finally, a UV inpainting module relies on the\ncorresponding feature, prediction and the posed template, and completes the\npredictions of occluded body shape. Our framework leverages the best of\nnon-parametric and model-based methods and is also robust to partial occlusion.\nExperiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing 3D human\nestimation methods on multiple public benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "This work presents a probabilistic scheme for solving semilinear nonlocal\ndiffusion equations with volume constraints and integrable kernels. The\nnonlocal model of interest is defined by a time-dependent semilinear partial\nintegro-differential equation (PIDE), in which the integro-differential\noperator consists of both local convection-diffusion and nonlocal diffusion\noperators. Our numerical scheme is based on the direct approximation of the\nnonlinear Feynman-Kac formula that establishes a link between nonlinear PIDEs\nand stochastic differential equations. The exploitation of the Feynman-Kac\nrepresentation successfully avoids solving dense linear systems arising from\nnonlocality operators. Compared with existing stochastic approaches, our method\ncan achieve first-order convergence after balancing the temporal and spatial\ndiscretization errors, which is a significant improvement of existing\nprobabilistic/stochastic methods for nonlocal diffusion problems.

      "title": "Accurate non-stationary short-term traffic flow prediction method",
      "abstract": "Precise and timely traffic flow prediction plays a critical role in\ndeveloping intelligent transportation systems and has attracted considerable\nattention in recent decades. Despite the significant progress in this area\nbrought by deep learning, challenges remain. Traffic flows usually change\ndramatically in a short period, which prevents the current methods from\naccurately capturing the future trend and likely causes the over-fitting\nproblem, leading to unsatisfied accuracy. To this end, this paper proposes a\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based method that can forecast the short-term\ntraffic flow precisely and avoid local optimum problems during training.\nSpecifically, instead of using the non-stationary raw traffic data directly, we\nfirst decompose them into sub-components, where each one is less noisy than the\noriginal input. Afterward, Sample Entropy (SE) is employed to merge similar\ncomponents to reduce the computation cost. The merged features are fed into the\nLSTM, and we then introduce a spatiotemporal module to consider the neighboring\nrelationships in the recombined signals to avoid strong autocorrelation. During\ntraining, we utilize the Grey Wolf Algorithm (GWO) to optimize the parameters\nof LSTM, which overcome the overfitting issue. We conduct the experiments on a\nUK public highway traffic flow dataset, and the results show that the proposed\nmethod performs favorably against other state-of-the-art methods with better\nadaption performance on extreme outliers, delay effects, and trend-changing\nresponses.",

      "abstract": "First-principles molecular dynamics is employed to describe the atomic\nstructure of amorphous SiN, a non-stoichiometric compound belonging to the\nSi$_x$N$_{y}$ family. To produce the amorphous state via the cooling of the\nliquid, both the Car-Parrinello and the Born-Oppenheimer approaches are\nexploited to obtain a system featuring sizeable atomic mobility. At high\ntemperatures, due to the peculiar electronic structure of SiN, exhibiting gap\nclosing effects, the Car-Parrinello methodology could not be followed since\nnon-adiabatic effects involving the ionic and electronic degrees of freedom do\noccur. This shortcoming was surmounted by resorting to the Born-Oppenheimer\napproach allowing to achieve significant ionic diffusion at $T$= 2500 K. From\nthis highly diffusive sample, an amorphous state at room temperature was\nobtained with a quenching rate of 10 K/ps. Four different models were created,\ndiffering by their sizes and the thermal cycles. We found that the subnetwork\nof atoms N has the same environment than in the stoichiometric material\nSi$_3$N$_4$ since N is mostly threefold coordinated with Si. Si atoms can also\nbe found coordinated to four N atoms as in Si$_3$N$_4$, but a substantial\nfraction of them forms homopolar bonds with one, two, three and even four Si.\nOur results are not too dissimilar from former models available in the\nlitterature but they feature a higher statistical accuracy and refer more\nprecisely to room temperature as the reference thermodynamical condition for\nthe analysis of the structure in the amorphous state.",

An alternative route is to use simpler, more transparent white\nbox models, in which task-specific feature construction replaces the more\nopaque feature discovery process performed automatically within deep learning\nmodels. Using data from the Groningen Gas Field in the Netherlands, we build on\nan existing logistic regression model by the addition of four further features\ndiscovered using elastic net driven data mining within the catch22 time series\nanalysis package. We then evaluate the performance of the augmented logistic\nregression model relative to a deep (CNN) model, pre-trained on the Groningen\ndata, on progressively increasing noise-to-signal ratios. We discover that, for\neach ratio, our logistic regression model correctly detects every earthquake,\nwhile the deep model fails to detect nearly 20 % of seismic events, thus\njustifying at least a degree of caution in the application of deep models,\nespecially to data with higher noise-to-signal ratios.",

      "abstract": "Due to its high transmissibility, Omicron BA.1 ousted the Delta variant to\nbecome a dominating variant in late 2021 and was replaced by more transmissible\nOmicron BA.2 in March 2022. An important question is which new variants will\ndominate in the future. Topology-based deep learning models have had tremendous\nsuccess in forecasting emerging variants in the past. However, topology is\ninsensitive to homotopic shape variations in virus-human protein-protein\nbinding, which are crucial to viral evolution and transmission. This challenge\nis tackled with persistent Laplacian, which is able to capture both the\ntopology and shape of data. Persistent Laplacian-based deep learning models are\ndeveloped to systematically evaluate variant infectivity. Our comparative\nanalysis of Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1,\nBA.2, BA.2.11, BA.2.12.1, BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5 unveils that Omicron BA.2.11,\nBA.2.12.1, BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5 are more contagious than BA.2. In particular,\nBA.4 and BA.5 are about 36\\% more infectious than BA.2 and are projected to\nbecome new dominating variants by natural selection.

      "abstract": "Humans interact with an object in many different ways by making contact at\ndifferent locations, creating a highly complex motion space that can be\ndifficult to learn, particularly when synthesizing such human interactions in a\ncontrollable manner. Existing works on synthesizing human scene interaction\nfocus on the high-level control of action but do not consider the fine-grained\ncontrol of motion. In this work, we study the problem of synthesizing scene\ninteractions conditioned on different contact positions on the object. As a\ntestbed to investigate this new problem, we focus on human-chair interaction as\none of the most common actions which exhibit large variability in terms of\ncontacts. We propose a novel synthesis framework COUCH that plans ahead the\nmotion by predicting contact-aware control signals of the hands, which are then\nused to synthesize contact-conditioned interactions. Furthermore, we contribute\na large human-chair interaction dataset with clean annotations, the COUCH\nDataset. Our method shows significant quantitative and qualitative improvements\nover existing methods for human-object interactions. More importantly, our\nmethod enables control of the motion through user-specified or automatically\npredicted contacts.",

      "abstract": "Automatic traffic classification is increasingly becoming important in\ntraffic engineering, as the current trend of encrypting transport information\n(e.g., behind HTTP-encrypted tunnels) prevents intermediate nodes from\naccessing end-to-end packet headers. However, this information is crucial for\ntraffic shaping, network slicing, and Quality of Service (QoS) management, for\npreventing network intrusion, and for anomaly detection. 3D networks offer\nmultiple routes that can guarantee different levels of QoS.

In this paper,\na federated feature selection and feature reduction learning scheme is proposed\nto classify network traffic in a semi-supervised cooperative manner.

      "abstract": "Masked Language Models (MLMs) pre-trained by predicting masked tokens on\nlarge corpora have been used successfully in natural language processing tasks\nfor a variety of languages. Unfortunately, it was reported that MLMs also learn\ndiscriminative biases regarding attributes such as gender and race. Because\nmost studies have focused on MLMs in English, the bias of MLMs in other\nlanguages has rarely been investigated. Manual annotation of evaluation data\nfor languages other than English has been challenging due to the cost and\ndifficulty in recruiting annotators. Moreover, the existing bias evaluation\nmethods require the stereotypical sentence pairs consisting of the same context\nwith attribute words (e.g. He/She is a nurse). We propose Multilingual Bias\nEvaluation (MBE) score, to evaluate bias in various languages using only\nEnglish attribute word lists and parallel corpora between the target language\nand English without requiring manually annotated data. We evaluated MLMs in\neight languages using the MBE and confirmed that gender-related biases are\nencoded in MLMs for all those languages. We manually created datasets for\ngender bias in Japanese and Russian to evaluate the validity of the MBE. The\nresults show that the bias scores reported by the MBE significantly correlates\nwith that computed from the above manually created datasets and the existing\nEnglish datasets for gender bias.",

Our approach takes into account the wide range\nof human driver behaviors on the road, from aggressive maneuvers like speeding\nand overtaking, to conservative traits like driving slowly and conforming to\nthe right-most lane. In our approach, we learn a mapping from a data-driven\nhuman driver behavior model called the CMetric to a driver's entropic risk\npreference. We then use the derived risk preference within a game-theoretic\nrisk-sensitive planner to model risk-aware interactions among human drivers and\nan autonomous vehicle in various traffic scenarios. We demonstrate our method\nin a merging scenario, where our results show that the final trajectories\nobtained from the risk-aware planner generate desirable emergent behaviors.\nParticularly, our planner recognizes aggressive human drivers and yields to\nthem while maintaining a greater distance from them. In a user study,\nparticipants were able to distinguish between aggressive and conservative\nsimulated drivers based on trajectories generated from our risk-sensitive\nplanner. We also observe that aggressive human driving results in more frequent\nlane-changing in the planner. Finally, we compare the performance of our\nmodified risk-aware planner with existing methods and show that modeling human\ndriver behavior leads to safer navigation.",

      "abstract": "Detection transformers like DETR have recently shown promising performance on\nmany object detection tasks, but the generalization ability of those methods is\nstill quite challenging for cross-domain adaptation scenarios. To address the\ncross-domain issue, a straightforward way is to perform token alignment with\nadversarial training in transformers. However, its performance is often\nunsatisfactory as the tokens in detection transformers are quite diverse and\nrepresent different spatial and semantic information. In this paper, we propose\na new method called Spatial-aware and Semantic-aware Token Alignment (SSTA) for\ncross-domain detection transformers. In particular, we take advantage of the\ncharacteristics of cross-attention as used in detection transformer and propose\nthe spatial-aware token alignment (SpaTA) and the semantic-aware token\nalignment (SemTA) strategies to guide the token alignment across domains. For\nspatial-aware token alignment, we can extract the information from the\ncross-attention map (CAM) to align the distribution of tokens according to\ntheir attention to object queries. For semantic-aware token alignment, we\ninject the category information into the cross-attention map and construct\ndomain embedding to guide the learning of a multi-class discriminator so as to\nmodel the category relationship and achieve category-level token alignment\nduring the entire adaptation process. We conduct extensive experiments on\nseveral widely-used benchmarks, and the results clearly show the effectiveness\nof our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art baselines.",

      "abstract": "The research for characterizing GNN expressiveness attracts much attention as\ngraph neural networks achieve a champion in the last five years. The number of\nlinear regions has been considered a good measure for the expressivity of\nneural networks with piecewise linear activation. In this paper, we present\nsome estimates for the number of linear regions of the classic graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs) with one layer and multiple-layer scenarios. In\nparticular, we obtain an optimal upper bound for the maximum number of linear\nregions for one-layer GCNs, and the upper and lower bounds for multi-layer\nGCNs. The simulated estimate shows that the true maximum number of linear\nregions is possibly closer to our estimated lower bound. These results imply\nthat the number of linear regions of multi-layer GCNs is exponentially greater\nthan one-layer GCNs per parameter in general. This suggests that deeper GCNs\nhave more expressivity than shallow GCNs.",

We investigate\ndifferences in the narrative comments given to male and female students by both\nmale or female faculty assessors, using a fine-tuned BERT model. This allows us\nto examine whether groups are written about in systematically different ways,\nwithout relying on hand-crafted wordlists or topic models. We compare these\nresults to results from the traditional LIWC method and find that, although we\nfind no evidence of group-level gender bias in this dataset, terms related to\nfamily and children are used more in feedback given to women.",

      "abstract": "To prevent unintentional data leakage, research community has resorted to\ndata generators that can produce differentially private data for model\ntraining. However, for the sake of the data privacy, existing solutions suffer\nfrom either expensive training cost or poor generalization performance.\nTherefore, we raise the question whether training efficiency and privacy can be\nachieved simultaneously. In this work, we for the first time identify that\ndataset condensation (DC) which is originally designed for improving training\nefficiency is also a better solution to replace the traditional data generators\nfor private data generation, thus providing privacy for free. To demonstrate\nthe privacy benefit of DC, we build a connection between DC and differential\nprivacy, and theoretically prove on linear feature extractors (and then\nextended to non-linear feature extractors) that the existence of one sample has\nlimited impact ($O(m/n)$) on the parameter distribution of networks trained on\n$m$ samples synthesized from $n (n \\gg m)$ raw samples by DC. We also\nempirically validate the visual privacy and membership privacy of\nDC-synthesized data by launching both the loss-based and the state-of-the-art\nlikelihood-based membership inference attacks. We envision this work as a\nmilestone for data-efficient and privacy-preserving machine learning.",

To address\nthis issue, we firstly propose a unified deep learning enabled semantic\ncommunication system (U-DeepSC), where a unified model is developed to serve\nvarious transmission tasks. To jointly serve these tasks in one model with\nfixed parameters, we employ domain adaptation in the training procedure to\nspecify the task-specific features for each task. Thus, the system only needs\nto transmit the task-specific features, rather than all the features, to reduce\nthe transmission overhead. Moreover, since each task is of different difficulty\nand requires different number of layers to achieve satisfactory performance, we\ndevelop the multi-exit architecture to provide early-exit results for\nrelatively simple tasks. In the experiments, we employ a proposed U-DeepSC to\nserve five tasks with multi-modalities. Simulation results demonstrate that our\nproposed U-DeepSC achieves comparable performance to the task-oriented semantic\ncommunication system designed for a specific task with significant transmission\noverhead reduction and much less number of model parameters.",

      "abstract": "The computational drug repositioning aims to discover new uses for marketed\ndrugs, which can accelerate the drug development process and play an important\nrole in the existing drug discovery system. However, the number of validated\ndrug-disease associations is scarce compared to the number of drugs and\ndiseases in the real world. Too few labeled samples will make the\nclassification model unable to learn effective latent factors of drugs,\nresulting in poor generalization performance. In this work, we propose a\nmulti-task self-supervised learning framework for computational drug\nrepositioning. The framework tackles label sparsity by learning a better drug\nrepresentation. Specifically, we take the drug-disease association prediction\nproblem as the main task, and the auxiliary task is to use data augmentation\nstrategies and contrast learning to mine the internal relationships of the\noriginal drug features, so as to automatically learn a better drug\nrepresentation without supervised labels. And through joint training, it is\nensured that the auxiliary task can improve the prediction accuracy of the main\ntask. More precisely, the auxiliary task improves drug representation and\nserving as additional regularization to improve generalization. Furthermore, we\ndesign a multi-input decoding network to improve the reconstruction ability of\nthe autoencoder model. We evaluate our model using three real-world datasets.\nThe experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-task\nself-supervised learning framework, and its predictive ability is superior to\nthe state-of-the-art model.",

      "abstract": "DRAM-based main memory is used in nearly all computing systems as a major\ncomponent. One way of overcoming the main memory bottleneck is to move\ncomputation near memory, a paradigm known as processing-in-memory (PiM). Recent\nPiM techniques provide a promising way to improve the performance and energy\nefficiency of existing and future systems at no additional DRAM hardware cost.\n  We develop the Processing-in-DRAM (PiDRAM) framework, the first flexible,\nend-to-end, and open source framework that enables system integration studies\nand evaluation of real PiM techniques using real DRAM chips. We demonstrate a\nprototype of PiDRAM on an FPGA-based platform (Xilinx ZC706) that implements an\nopen-source RISC-V system (Rocket Chip). To demonstrate the flexibility and\nease of use of PiDRAM, we implement two PiM techniques: (1) RowClone, an\nin-DRAM copy and initialization mechanism (using command sequences proposed by\nComputeDRAM), and (2) D-RaNGe, an in-DRAM true random number generator based on\nDRAM activation-latency failures.\n  Our end-to-end evaluation of RowClone shows up to 14.6X speedup for copy and\n12.6X initialization operations over CPU copy (i.e., conventional memcpy) and\ninitialization (i.e., conventional calloc) operations. Our implementation of\nD-RaNGe provides high throughput true random numbers, reaching 8.30 Mb/s\nthroughput. Over the Verilog and C++ basis provided by PiDRAM, implementing the\nrequired hardware and software components, implementing RowClone end-to-end\ntakes 198 (565) and implementing D-RaNGe end-to-end takes 190 (78) lines of\nVerilog (C++) code.

      "abstract": "Text classification aims to assign labels to textual units by making use of\nglobal information. Recent studies have applied graph neural network (GNN) to\ncapture the global word co-occurrence in a corpus. Existing approaches require\nthat all the nodes (training and test) in a graph are present during training,\nwhich are transductive and do not naturally generalise to unseen nodes. To make\nthose models inductive, they use extra resources, like pretrained word\nembedding. However, high-quality resource is not always available and hard to\ntrain. Under the extreme settings with no extra resource and limited amount of\ntraining set, can we still learn an inductive graph-based text classification\nmodel? In this paper, we introduce a novel inductive graph-based text\nclassification framework, InducT-GCN (InducTive Graph Convolutional Networks\nfor Text classification). Compared to transductive models that require test\ndocuments in training, we construct a graph based on the statistics of training\ndocuments only and represent document vectors with a weighted sum of word\nvectors. We then conduct one-directional GCN propagation during testing. Across\nfive text classification benchmarks, our InducT-GCN outperformed\nstate-of-the-art methods that are either transductive in nature or pre-trained\nadditional resources. We also conducted scalability testing by gradually\nincreasing the data size and revealed that our InducT-GCN can reduce the time\nand space complexity.

      "abstract": "Numerous researchers have conducted studies to achieve fast and robust\nground-optimized LiDAR odometry methods for terrestrial mobile platforms. In\nparticular, ground-optimized LiDAR odometry usually employs ground segmentation\nas a preprocessing method. This is because most of the points in a 3D point\ncloud captured by a 3D LiDAR sensor on a terrestrial platform are from the\nground. However, the effect of the performance of ground segmentation on LiDAR\nodometry is still not closely examined. In this paper, a robust\nground-optimized LiDAR odometry framework is proposed to facilitate the study\nto check the effect of ground segmentation on LiDAR SLAM based on the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) method. By using our proposed odometry framework, it is\neasy and straightforward to test whether ground segmentation algorithms help\nextract well-described features and thus improve SLAM performance. In addition,\nby leveraging the SOTA ground segmentation method called Patchwork, which shows\nrobust ground segmentation even in complex and uneven urban environments with\nlittle performance perturbation, a novel ground-optimized LiDAR odometry is\nproposed, called PaGO-LOAM. The methods were tested using the KITTI odometry\ndataset. \\textit{PaGO-LOAM} shows robust and accurate performance compared with\nthe baseline method.

      "abstract": "We study lifelong reinforcement learning (RL) in a regret minimization\nsetting of linear contextual Markov decision process (MDP), where the agent\nneeds to learn a multi-task policy while solving a streaming sequence of tasks.\nWe propose an algorithm, called UCB Lifelong Value Distillation (UCBlvd), that\nprovably achieves sublinear regret for any sequence of tasks, which may be\nadaptively chosen based on the agent's past behaviors. Remarkably, our\nalgorithm uses only sublinear number of planning calls, which means that the\nagent eventually learns a policy that is near optimal for multiple tasks (seen\nor unseen) without the need of deliberate planning. A key to this property is a\nnew structural assumption that enables computation sharing across tasks during\nexploration. Specifically, for $K$ task episodes of horizon $H$, our algorithm\nhas a regret bound $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{(d^3+d^\\prime d)H^4K})$ based on\n$\\mathcal{O}(dH\\log(K))$ number of planning calls, where $d$ and $d^\\prime$ are\nthe feature dimensions of the dynamics and rewards, respectively.

      "abstract": "Over the last few years, standardisation efforts are consolidating the role\nof the Routing Protocol for LowPower and Lossy Networks (RPL) as the standard\nrouting protocol for IPv6 based Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Although many\ncore functionalities are well defined, others are left implementation\ndependent. Among them, the definition of an efficient link quality estimation\n(LQE) strategy is of paramount importance, as it influences significantly both\nthe quality of the selected network routes and nodes' energy consumption. In\nthis paper, we present RLProbe, a novel strategy for link quality monitoring in\nRPL, which accurately measures link quality with minimal overhead and energy\nwaste. To achieve this goal, RLProbe leverages both synchronous and\nasynchronous monitoring schemes to maintain up-to-date information on link\nquality and to promptly react to sudden topology changes, e.g. due to mobility.\nOur solution relies on a reinforcement learning model to drive the monitoring\nprocedures in order to minimise the overhead caused by active probing\noperations. The performance of the proposed solution is assessed by means of\nsimulations and real experiments. Results demonstrated that RLProbe helps in\neffectively improving packet loss rates, allowing nodes to promptly react to\nlink quality variations as well as to link failures due to node mobility.",

      "abstract": "The saturating counter is the basic module of the dynamic branch predictor,\nwhich involves the core technique to improve instruction level parallelism\nperformance in modern processors. However, most studies focus on the\nperformance improvement and hardware consumption of saturating counters, while\nignoring the security problems they may cause. In this paper, we creatively\npropose to study and design saturating counters from the defense perspective of\ndifferential privacy, so that attackers cannot distinguish the states that\nsaturating counters are in and further infer sensitive information. To obtain\ntheoretical guarantees, we use Markov chain to formalize the attack algorithm\napplied to the saturating counter, investigate into the optimal attack strategy\nand calculate the probability of successful attack. Furthermore, we find that\nthe attacker is able to accurately guess the branch execution of the victim's\nprocess in the existing saturating counters. To avoid this, we design a new\nprobabilistic saturating counter, which generalizes the existing conventional\nand probabilistic saturating counters. The guarantee of differential privacy is\napplied to deduce parameters of the new saturating counters so that the\nsecurity requirement can be satisfied. We also theoretically calculate the\nmisprediction rate when the saturating counter reaches the steady state. The\nexperimental results on testing programs show that the calculated theoretical\nresults agree with the experimental performances. Compared with the existing\nconventional and probabilistic saturating counters, when the parameters of our\ndesigned models are selected appropriately, the new saturating counters can not\nonly ensure similar operational performance, but also establish strict security\nguarantee.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years, object detection has attracted a lot of attention in\nthe context of human-robot collaboration and Industry 5.0 due to enormous\nquality improvements in deep learning technologies. In many applications,\nobject detection models have to be able to quickly adapt to a changing\nenvironment, i.e., to learn new objects. A crucial but challenging prerequisite\nfor this is the automatic generation of new training data which currently still\nlimits the broad application of object detection methods in industrial\nmanufacturing. In this work, we discuss how to adapt state-of-the-art object\ndetection methods for the task of automatic bounding box annotation for the use\ncase where the background is homogeneous and the object's label is provided by\na human. We compare an adapted version of Faster R-CNN and the Scaled Yolov4-p5\narchitecture and show that both can be trained to distinguish unknown objects\nfrom a complex but homogeneous background using only a small amount of training\ndata.",

      "abstract": "The advent of the internet, followed shortly by the social media made it\nubiquitous in consuming and sharing information between anyone with access to\nit. The evolution in the consumption of media driven by this change, led to the\nemergence of images as means to express oneself, convey information and\nconvince others efficiently. With computer vision algorithms progressing\nradically over the last decade, it is become easier and easier to study at\nscale the role of images in the flow of information online. While the research\nquestions and overall pipelines differ radically, almost all start with a\ncrucial first step - evaluation of global perceptual similarity between\ndifferent images. That initial step is crucial for overall pipeline performance\nand processes most images. A number of algorithms are available and currently\nused to perform it, but so far no comprehensive review was available to guide\nthe choice of researchers as to the choice of an algorithm best suited to their\nquestion, assumptions and computational resources. With this paper we aim to\nfill this gap, showing that classical computer vision methods are not\nnecessarily the best approach, whereas a pair of relatively little used methods\n- Dhash perceptual hash and SimCLR v2 ResNets achieve excellent performance,\nscale well and are computationally efficient.",

To determine\nthe insdel distances of linear codes is a very challenging problem. The\nhalf-Singleton bound on the insdel distances of linear codes due to\nCheng-Guruswami-Haeupler-Li is a basic upper bound on the insertion-deletion\nerror-correcting capabilities of linear codes. On the other hand the natural\ndirect upper bound $d_I(\\mathcal C) \\leq 2d_H(\\mathcal C)$ is valid for any\ninsdel code. In this paper, for a linear insdel code $\\mathcal C$ we propose a\nstrict half-Singleton upper bound $d_I(\\mathcal C) \\leq 2(n-2k+1)$ if $\\mathcal\nC$ does not contain the codeword with all 1s, and a stronger direct upper bound\n$d_I(\\mathcal C) \\leq 2(d_H(\\mathcal C)-t)$ under a weak condition, where\n$t\\geq 1$ is a positive integer determined by the generator matrix. We also\ngive optimal linear insdel codes attaining our strict half-Singleton bound and\ndirect upper bound, and show that the code length of optimal binary linear\ninsdel codes with respect to the (strict) half-Singleton bound is about twice\nthe dimension. Interestingly explicit optimal linear insdel codes attaining the\n(strict) half-Singleton bound, with the code length being independent of the\nfinite field size, are given.",

More specifically, we first\npropose discrete gradient flow approximations based on non-standard Dirichlet\nenergies for problems involving essential boundary conditions posed on bounded\nspatial domains. The imposition of the boundary conditions is realized weakly\nvia non-standard functionals; the latter classically arise in the construction\nof Galerkin-type numerical methods and are often referred to as \"Nitsche-type\"\nmethods. Moreover, inspired by the seminal work of Jordan, Kinderleher, and\nOtto (JKO) \\cite{jko}, we consider the second class of discrete gradient flows\nfor special classes of dissipative evolution PDE problems with non-essential\nboundary conditions. These JKO-type gradient flows are solved via deep neural\nnetwork approximations. A key, distinct aspect of the proposed methods is that\nthe discretization is constructed via a sequence of residual-type deep neural\nnetworks (DNN) corresponding to implicit time-stepping. As a result, a DNN\nrepresents the PDE problem solution at each time node. This approach offers\nseveral advantages in the training of each DNN.

      "abstract": "Image alignment, also known as image registration, is a critical block used\nin many computer vision problems. One of the key factors in alignment is\nefficiency, as inefficient aligners can cause significant overhead to the\noverall problem. In the literature, there are some blocks that appear to do the\nalignment operation, although most do not focus on efficiency. Therefore, an\nimage alignment block which can both work in time and/or space and can work on\nedge devices would be beneficial for almost all networks dealing with multiple\nimages. Given its wide usage and importance, we propose an efficient,\ncross-attention-based, multi-purpose image alignment block (XABA) suitable to\nwork within edge devices. Using cross-attention, we exploit the relationships\nbetween features extracted from images. To make cross-attention feasible for\nreal-time image alignment problems and handle large motions, we provide a\npyramidal block based cross-attention scheme. This also captures local\nrelationships besides reducing memory requirements and number of operations.\nEfficient XABA models achieve real-time requirements of running above 20 FPS\nperformance on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier with 30W power consumption compared to\nother powerful computers. Used as a sub-block in a larger network, XABA also\nimproves multi-image super-resolution network performance in comparison to\nother alignment methods.",

      "abstract": "Coherent noise regularly plagues seismic recordings, causing artefacts and\nuncertainties in products derived from down-the-line processing and imaging\ntasks. The outstanding capabilities of deep learning in denoising of natural\nand medical images have recently spur a number of applications of neural\nnetworks in the context of seismic data denoising. A limitation of the majority\nof such methods is that the deep learning procedure is supervised and requires\nclean (noise-free) data as a target for training the network. Blindspot\nnetworks were recently proposed to overcome this requirement, allowing training\nto be performed directly on the noisy field data as a powerful suppressor of\nrandom noise. A careful adaptation of the blind-spot methodology allows for an\nextension to coherent noise suppression. In this work, we expand the\nmethodology of blind-spot networks to create a blind-trace network that\nsuccessfully removes trace-wise coherent noise. Through an extensive synthetic\nanalysis, we illustrate the denoising procedure's robustness to varying noise\nlevels, as well as varying numbers of noisy traces within shot gathers. It is\nshown that the network can accurately learn to suppress the noise when up to\n60% of the original traces are noisy. Furthermore, the proposed procedure is\nimplemented on the Stratton 3D field dataset and is shown to restore the\npreviously corrupted direct arrivals. Our adaptation of the blind-spot network\nfor self-supervised, trace-wise noise suppression could lead to other use-cases\nsuch as the suppression of coherent noise arising from wellsite activity,\npassing vessels or nearby industrial activity.",

We compare our results to averaging of repeated scans, a\nwidespread method used in clinics to improve signal-to-noise ratio of MR\nimages. To obtain training data for transfer learning, we model, in a\ndata-driven fashion, the effects of echo-planar imaging (EPI): Nyquist ghosting\nand ramp sampling. We introduce these effects to the digital phantom of brain\nanatomy (BrainWeb). Instead of simulating pseudo-random noise with a defined\nprobability distribution, we perform noise scans with a brain-DWI-designed\nprotocol to obtain realistic noise maps. We combine them with the simulated,\nnoise-free EPI images. We also measure the Point Spread Function in a DW image\nof an AJR-approved geometrical phantom and inter-scan movement in a brain scan\nof a healthy volunteer. Their influence on image denoising and averaging of\nrepeated images is investigated at different signal-to-noise ratio levels.\nDenoising performance is evaluated quantitatively using the simulated EPI\nimages and qualitatively in real EPI DWI of the brain. We show that the\napplication of our method allows for a significant reduction in scan time by\nlowering the number of repeated scans. Visual comparisons made in the acquired\nbrain images indicate that the denoised single-repetition images are less noisy\nthan multi-repetition averaged images.

      "abstract": "With the explosive growth of vehicle applications, vehicular networks based\non millimeter wave (mmWave) bands have attracted interests from both academia\nand industry. mmWave communications are able to utilize the huge available\nbandwidth to provide multiple Gbps transmission rates among vehicles. In this\npaper, we address the content distribution scheduling problem in mmWave\nvehicular networks. It has been challenging for all vehicles in the same\nnetwork to complete content downloading due to the limited communication\nresources of roadside units (RSUs) and the high mobility of vehicles. We\npropose a joint vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-tovehicle (V2V)\nscheduling scheme to minimize the total number of content distribution time\nslots from a global optimization perspective. In the V2I phase, the RSU\nserially transmits integrity content to vehicles, which are selected according\nto the vehicular network topology and transmission scheduling scheme. In the\nV2V phase, full-duplex communications and concurrent transmissions are\nexploited to achieve content sharing between vehicles and improve transmission\nefficiency. Performance evaluations demonstrate that our proposed scheme\nreduces the number of time slots and significantly improves system throughput\nwhen compared with other schemes, especially under large-size file transfers\nand a large number of vehicles.",

The digital twin network (DTN) can ease these burdens by virtually\nenabling users to understand how performance changes accordingly with\nmodifications. For this \"What-if\" performance evaluation, conventional\nsimulation and analytical approaches are inefficient, inaccurate, and\ninflexible, and we argue that data-driven methods are most promising. In this\narticle, we identify three requirements (fidelity, efficiency, and flexibility)\nfor performance evaluation. Then we present a comparison of selected\ndata-driven methods and investigate their potential trends in data, models, and\napplications. Although extensive applications have been enabled, there are\nstill significant conflicts between models' capacities to handle diversified\ninputs and limited data collected from the production network. We further\nillustrate the opportunities for data collection, model construction, and\napplication prospects. This survey aims to provide a reference for performance\nevaluation while also facilitating future DTN research.",

To\nevaluate the effects of the duct, simulations with the same tip speed ratios\nare also performed on the corresponding open-rotor turbine. It is found that\nthe ducted turbine consistently obtains higher power outputs than the\nopen-rotor counterpart, and the duct itself enhances flow turbulence and blade\ntrailing-edge vortices but weakens tip and hub vortices. Flow bifurcation is\nobserved at the largest tip speed ratio and is identified to be caused by blade\nblockage effects.

It is noticed that the ducted configuration is\ninsensitive to small yaw angles and maintains higher power outputs than the\nopen-rotor configuration at all yaw angles. Moreover, it is observed that the\nwakes of both configurations recover more quickly as the yaw angle increases.",

      "abstract": "Model-based offline optimization with dynamics-aware policy provides a new\nperspective for policy learning and out-of-distribution generalization, where\nthe learned policy could adapt to different dynamics enumerated at the training\nstage. But due to the limitation under the offline setting, the learned model\ncould not mimic real dynamics well enough to support reliable\nout-of-distribution exploration, which still hinders policy to generalize well.\nTo narrow the gap, previous works roughly ensemble randomly initialized models\nto better approximate the real dynamics. However, such practice is costly and\ninefficient, and provides no guarantee on how well the real dynamics could be\napproximated by the learned models, which we name coverability in this paper.\nWe actively address this issue by generating models with provable ability to\ncover real dynamics in an efficient and controllable way. To that end, we\ndesign a distance metric for dynamic models based on the occupancy of policies\nunder the dynamics, and propose an algorithm to generate models optimizing\ntheir coverage for the real dynamics. We give a theoretical analysis on the\nmodel generation process and proves that our algorithm could provide enhanced\ncoverability. As a downstream task, we train a dynamics-aware policy with minor\nor no conservative penalty, and experiments demonstrate that our algorithm\noutperforms prior offline methods on existing offline RL benchmarks. We also\ndiscover that policies learned by our method have better zero-shot transfer\nperformance, implying their better generalization.",

      "abstract": "Over the past few years, the concept of VR has attracted increasing interest\nthanks to its extensive industrial and commercial applications. Currently, the\n3D models of the virtual scenes are generally stored in the VR visor itself,\nwhich operates as a standalone device. However, applications that entail\nmulti-party interactions will likely require the scene to be processed by an\nexternal server and then streamed to the visors. However, the stringent Quality\nof Service (QoS) constraints imposed by VR's interactive nature require Network\nSlicing (NS) solutions, for which profiling the traffic generated by the VR\napplication is crucial. To this end, we collected more than 4 hours of traces\nin a real setup and analyzed their temporal correlation. More specifically, we\nfocused on the CBR encoding mode, which should generate more predictable\ntraffic streams. From the collected data, we then distilled two prediction\nmodels for future frame size, which can be instrumental in the design of\ndynamic resource allocation algorithms. Our results show that even the\nstate-of-the-art H.264 CBR mode can have significant fluctuations, which can\nimpact the NS optimization. We then exploited the proposed models to\ndynamically determine the Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters in an NS\nscenario, providing service with the required QoS while minimizing resource\nusage.",

For a generic variational family defined using the\nsame backward decomposition as the actual joint smoothing distribution, we\nestablish for the first time that, under mixing assumptions, the variational\napproximation of expectations of additive state functionals induces an error\nwhich grows at most linearly in the number of observations.

Consequently, to ensure end-to-end secure\ncommunication and authentication, (i) traditional industrial protocols, e.g.,\nModbus, are retrofitted with TLS support, and (ii) modern protocols, e.g.,\nMQTT, are directly designed to use TLS. To understand whether these changes\nindeed lead to secure Industrial Internet of Things deployments, i.e., using\nTLS-based protocols, which are configured according to security best practices,\nwe perform an Internet-wide security assessment of ten industrial protocols\ncovering the complete IPv4 address space.\n  Our results show that both, retrofitted existing protocols and newly\ndeveloped secure alternatives, are barely noticeable in the wild. While we find\nthat new protocols have a higher TLS adoption rate than traditional protocols\n(7.2% vs. 0.4%), the overall adoption of TLS is comparably low (6.5% of hosts).\nThus, most industrial deployments (934,736 hosts) are insecurely connected to\nthe Internet. Furthermore, we identify that 42% of hosts with TLS support\n(26,665 hosts) show security deficits, e.g., missing access control. Finally,\nwe show that support in configuring systems securely, e.g., via configuration\ntemplates, is promising to strengthen security.",

      "abstract": "We propose an improved successive branch reduction (SBR) method to solve\nstochastic distribution network reconfiguration (SDNR), a mixed-integer program\nthat is known to be computationally challenging. First, for a special\ndistribution network with a single redundant branch, we propose an improved\ndesign for a one-stage SBR algorithm in the literature to incorporate uncertain\nrenewable generations and loads. Based on solving stochastic optimal power\nflow, the improved algorithm identifies and searches through a small set of\ncandidate branches, from which it determines the optimal branch to open and\nobtains a radial network with the minimum expected operational cost. Then, for\na general network with multiple redundant branches, we design a heuristic\ntwo-stage SBR algorithm based on a close-and-open procedure that iteratively\nruns the proposed one-stage SBR algorithm. Numerical results on the IEEE 33-bus\nand 123-bus distribution network models verify the proposed method in terms of\noptimality and computational efficiency.",

We devise\nintelligent pre-processing schemes to decompose channel state information (CSI)\nobservation vectors into \"predictable\" and \"unpredictable\" components. The\nformer, primarily due to large-scale fading, can be used for node\nauthentication through RF fingerprinting. The latter, primarily due to\nsmall-scale fading, could be used for semantically secure secret key generation\n(SKG). To perform the decomposition, we propose: (i) a fingerprint\n\"separability\" criterion, expressed through the maximisation of the total\nvariation distance between the empirical fingerprint measures; (ii) a\nstatistical independence metric for observations collected at different users,\nexpressed through a normalised version of the $d$-dimensional Hilbert Schmidt\nindependence criterion (dHSIC) test statistic. We propose both explicit\nimplementations, using principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel PCA and\nblack-box, unsupervised learning, using autoencoders. Our experiments on\nsynthetic and real CSI datasets showcase that the incorporation of RF\nfingerprinting and SKG, with explicit security guarantees, is tangible in\nfuture generations of wireless.",

      "abstract": "We study the communication complexity of dominant strategy implementations of\ncombinatorial auctions. We start with two domains that are generally considered\n\"easy\": multi-unit auctions with decreasing marginal values and combinatorial\nauctions with gross substitutes valuations. For both domains we have fast\nalgorithms that find the welfare-maximizing allocation with communication\ncomplexity that is poly-logarithmic in the input size. This immediately implies\nthat welfare maximization can be achieved in ex-post equilibrium with no\nsignificant communication cost, by using VCG payments. In contrast, we show\nthat in both domains the communication complexity of any dominant strategy\nimplementation that achieves the optimal welfare is polynomial in the input\nsize.\n  We then move on to studying the approximation ratios achievable by dominant\nstrategy mechanisms. For multi-unit auctions with decreasing marginal values,\nwe provide a dominant-strategy communication FPTAS. For combinatorial auctions\nwith general valuations, we show that there is no dominant strategy mechanism\nthat achieves an approximation ratio better than $m^{1-\\epsilon}$ that uses\n$poly(m,n)$ bits of communication, where $m$ is the number of items and $n$ is\nthe number of bidders. In contrast, a \\emph{randomized} dominant strategy\nmechanism that achieves an $O(\\sqrt m)$ approximation with $poly(m,n)$\ncommunication is known. This proves the first gap between computationally\nefficient deterministic dominant strategy mechanisms and randomized ones.\n  En route, we answer an open question on the communication cost of\nimplementing dominant strategy mechanisms for more than two players, and also\nsolve some open problems in the area of simultaneous combinatorial auctions.",

Most recent deep learning-based methods for\ncell detection use convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, inspired by\nthe success in other computer vision applications, vision transformers (ViTs)\nare also used for this purpose. We propose a novel hybrid CNN-ViT model for\ncell detection in microscopy images to exploit the advantages of both types of\ndeep learning models. We employ an efficient CNN, that was pre-trained on the\nImageNet dataset, to extract image features and utilize transfer learning to\nreduce the amount of required training data. Extracted image features are\nfurther processed by a combination of convolutional and transformer layers, so\nthat the convolutional layers can focus on local information and the\ntransformer layers on global information. Our centroid-based cell detection\nmethod represents cells as ellipses and is end-to-end trainable. Furthermore,\nwe show that our proposed model can outperform fully convolutional one-stage\ndetectors on four different 2D microscopy datasets.

Intelligent and adaptive attackers may indeed exploit specific\nvulnerabilities exposed by machine learning techniques to violate system\nsecurity. Being robust to adversarial data manipulation is thus an important,\nadditional requirement for machine learning algorithms to successfully operate\nin adversarial settings. In this work, we evaluate the security of Support\nVector Machines (SVMs) to well-crafted, adversarial label noise attacks. In\nparticular, we consider an attacker that aims to maximize the SVM's\nclassification error by flipping a number of labels in the training data. We\nformalize a corresponding optimal attack strategy, and solve it by means of\nheuristic approaches to keep the computational complexity tractable. We report\nan extensive experimental analysis on the effectiveness of the considered\nattacks against linear and non-linear SVMs, both on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets. We finally argue that our approach can also provide useful insights\nfor developing more secure SVM learning algorithms, and also novel techniques\nin a number of related research areas, such as semi-supervised and active\nlearning.",

      "abstract": "Simulations with an explicit description of intermolecular forces using\nelectronic structure methods are still not feasible for many systems of\ninterest. As a result, empirical methods such as force fields (FF) have become\nan established tool for the simulation of large and complex molecular systems.\nHowever, the parametrization of FF is time consuming and has traditionally been\nbased largely on experimental data, which is scarce for many functional groups.\nRecent years have therefore seen increasing efforts to automatize FF\nparametrization and a move towards FF fitted against quantum-mechanical\nreference data. Here, we propose an alternative strategy to parametrize\nintermolecular interactions, which makes use of machine learning and\ngradient-descent based optimization while retaining a functional form founded\nin physics. This strategy can be viewed as generalization of existing FF\nparametrization methods. In the proposed approach, graph neural networks are\nused in conjunction with automatic differentiation to parametrize physically\nmotivated models to potential-energy surfaces, enabling full automatization and\nbroad applicability in chemical space. As a result, highly accurate FF models\nare obtained which retain the computational efficiency, interpretability and\nrobustness of classical FF. To showcase the potential of the proposed method,\nboth a fixed-charge model and a polarizable model are parametrized for\nintermolecular interactions and applied to a wide range of systems including\ndimer dissociation curves and condensed-phase systems.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. We study effect of different quality optical character\nrecognition in interactive information retrieval with a collection of one\ndigitized historical Finnish newspaper. Method. This study is based on the\nsimulated interactive information retrieval work task model. Thirty-two users\nmade searches to an article collection of Finnish newspaper Uusi Suometar\n1869-1918 with ca. 1.45 million auto segmented articles. Our article search\ndatabase had two versions of each article with different quality optical\ncharacter recognition. Each user performed six pre-formulated and six\nself-formulated short queries and evaluated subjectively the top-10 results\nusing graded relevance scale of 0-3 without knowing about the optical character\nrecognition quality differences of the otherwise identical articles. Analysis.\nAnalysis of the user evaluations was performed by comparing mean averages of\nevaluations scores in user sessions. Differences of query results were detected\nby analysing lengths of returned articles in pre-formulated and self-formulated\nqueries and number of different documents retrieved overall in these two\nsessions. Results. The main result of the study is that improved optical\ncharacter recognition quality affects perceived usefulness of historical\nnewspaper articles positively. Conclusions. We were able to show that\nimprovement in optical character recognition quality of documents leads to\nhigher mean relevance evaluation scores of query results in our historical\nnewspaper collection. To the best of our knowledge this simulated interactive\nuser-task is the first one showing empirically that users' subjective relevance\nassessments are affected by a change in the quality of optically read text.",

Due to the massive amount of user-generated content on\nthese sites, modern machine learning techniques are found to be feasible and\ncost-effective to tackle this problem. However, linguistically diverse datasets\ncovering different social contexts in which offensive language is typically\nused are required to train generalizable models. In this paper, we identify the\nshortcomings of existing Bangla HS datasets and introduce a large manually\nlabeled dataset BD-SHS that includes HS in different social contexts. The\nlabeling criteria were prepared following a hierarchical annotation process,\nwhich is the first of its kind in Bangla HS to the best of our knowledge. The\ndataset includes more than 50,200 offensive comments crawled from online social\nnetworking sites and is at least 60% larger than any existing Bangla HS\ndatasets. We present the benchmark result of our dataset by training different\nNLP models resulting in the best one achieving an F1-score of 91.0%. In our\nexperiments, we found that a word embedding trained exclusively using 1.47\nmillion comments from social media and streaming sites consistently resulted in\nbetter modeling of HS detection in comparison to other pre-trained embeddings.\nOur dataset and all accompanying codes is publicly available at\ngithub.com/naurosromim/hate-speech-dataset-for-Bengali-social-media",

      "abstract": "The notion of string attractor has been introduced in [Kempa and Prezza,\n2018] in the context of Data Compression and it represents a set of positions\nof a finite word in which all of its factors can be \"attracted\". The smallest\nsize $\\gamma^*$ of a string attractor for a finite word is a lower bound for\nseveral repetitiveness measures associated with the most common compression\nschemes, including BWT-based and LZ-based compressors. The combinatorial\nproperties of the measure $\\gamma^*$ have been studied in [Mantaci et al.,\n2021]. Very recently, a complexity measure, called string attractor profile\nfunction, has been introduced for infinite words, by evaluating $\\gamma^*$ on\neach prefix. Such a measure has been studied for automatic sequences and\nlinearly recurrent infinite words [Schaeffer and Shallit, 2021]. In this paper,\nwe study the relationship between such a complexity measure and other\nwell-known combinatorial notions related to repetitiveness in the context of\ninfinite words, such as the factor complexity and the recurrence. Furthermore,\nwe introduce new string attractor-based complexity measures, in which the\nstructure and the distribution of positions in a string attractor of the\nprefixes of infinite words are considered. We show that such measures provide a\nfiner classification of some infinite families of words.",

      "abstract": "Self-contained loaders are widely adopted in botnets for injecting loading\ncommands and spawning new bots. While researchers can dissect bot clients to\nget various information of botnets, the cloud-based and self-contained design\nof loaders effectively hinders researchers from understanding the loaders'\nevolution and variation using classic methods. The decoupled nature of bot\nloaders also dramatically reduces the feasibility of investigating\nrelationships among clients and infrastructures. In this paper, we propose a\ntext-based method to investigate and analyze details of bot loaders using\nhoneypots. We leverage high interaction honeypots to collect request logs and\ndefine eight families of bot loaders based on the result of agglomerative\nclustering. At the function level, we push our study further to explore their\nhomological relationship based on similarity analysis of request logs using\nsequence aligning techniques. This further exploration discloses that the\nreleased code of Mirai keeps spawning new generations of botnets both on the\nclient and the server side. This paper uncovers the homology of active botnet\ninfrastructures, providing a new prospect on finding covert relationships among\ncybercrimes.

In\ncomparison to convolutional neural networks, vision transformers have a weaker\ninductive bias and therefore allow a more flexible feature detection. Due to\ntheir promising feature detection, this work explores vision transformers for\ntumor detection in digital pathology whole slide images in four tissue types,\nand for tissue type identification. We compared the patch-wise classification\nperformance of the vision transformer DeiT-Tiny to the state-of-the-art\nconvolutional neural network ResNet18. Due to the sparse availability of\nannotated whole slide images, we further compared both models pretrained on\nlarge amounts of unlabeled whole-slide images using state-of-the-art\nself-supervised approaches. The results show that the vision transformer\nperformed slightly better than the ResNet18 for three of four tissue types for\ntumor detection while the ResNet18 performed slightly better for the remaining\ntasks. The aggregated predictions of both models on slide level were\ncorrelated, indicating that the models captured similar imaging features. All\ntogether, the vision transformer models performed on par with the ResNet18\nwhile requiring more effort to train.

      "abstract": "We investigate a possible depiction of the famous SN 1054 event in specially\nminted coins produced in the Eastern Roman Empire in 1054 A.D. On these coins,\nwe investigate if the head of the Emperor, Constantine IX, might represent the\nSun with a bright 'star' on either side - Venus in the east and SN 1054 in the\nwest, perhaps also representing the newly split Christian churches. We explore\nthe idea that the eastern star represents the stable and well-known Venus and\nthe Eastern Orthodox Church, while the western star represents the short-lived\n'new star' and the 'fading' Western Catholic church. We examined 36 coins of\nthis rare Constantine IX Class IV batch. While no exact date could be\nassociated to any of these coins, they most likely were minted during the last\nsix months of Constantine IX's rule in 1054. We hypothesise that the stance of\nthe church concerning the order of the Universe, as well as the chaos\nsurrounding the Great Schism, played a crucial role in stopping the official\nreporting of an obvious event in the sky, yet a dangerous omen. A temporal\ncoincidence of all these events could be a reasonable explanation as well.",

      "abstract": "In audio-visual navigation (AVN), an intelligent agent needs to navigate to a\nconstantly sound-making object in complex 3D environments based on its audio\nand visual perceptions. While existing methods attempt to improve the\nnavigation performance with preciously designed path planning or intricate task\nsettings, none has improved the model generalisation on unheard sounds with\ntask settings unchanged. We thus propose a contrastive learning-based method to\ntackle this challenge by regularising the audio encoder, where the\nsound-agnostic goal-driven latent representations can be learnt from various\naudio signals of different classes. In addition, we consider two data\naugmentation strategies to enrich the training sounds. We demonstrate that our\ndesigns can be easily equipped to existing AVN frameworks to obtain an\nimmediate performance gain (13.4%$\\uparrow$ in SPL on Replica and\n12.2%$\\uparrow$ in SPL on MP3D).

      "abstract": "We consider electronic and optical properties of group III-Nitride monolayers\nusing first-principle calculations. The group III-Nitride monolayers have flat\nhexagonal structures with almost zero planar buckling, $\\Delta$. By tuning the\n$\\Delta$, the strong $\\sigma\\text{-}\\sigma$ bond through sp$^2$ hybridization\nof a flat form of these monolayers can be changed to a stronger\n$\\sigma\\text{-}\\pi$ bond through sp$^3$ hybridization. Consequently, the band\ngaps of the monolayers are tuned due to a dislocation of the $s$- and\n$p$-orbitals towards the Fermi energy. The band gaps decrease with increasing\n$\\Delta$ for those flat monolayers, which have a band gap greater than $1.0$\neV, while no noticeable change or a flat dispersion of the band gap is seen for\nthe flat monolayers, that have a band gap less than $1.0$ eV. The decreased\nband gap causes a decrease in the excitation energy, and thus the static\ndielectric function, refractive index, and the optical conductivity are\nincreased. In contrast, the flat band gap dispersion of few monolayers in the\ngroup III-Nitride induces a reduction in the static dielectric function, the\nrefractive index, and the optical conductivity. We therefore confirm that\ntuning of the planar buckling can be used to control the physical properties of\nthese monolayers, both for an enhancement and a reduction of the optical\nproperties. These results are of interest for the design of optoelectric\ndevices in nanoscale systems.",

To understand this pronounced difference, we\nuse metrics such as the number of PIEs (Hooker et al., 2019), Q-Score (Kalibhat\net al., 2022), and PD-Score (Baldock et al., 2021) to measure the impact of\npruning on the learned representation quality.

The\ninter- and intra-Coulomb interactions are taken into account in a Coulomb\nblockade DQD where the electron sequential tunneling via four different master\nequation approaches is considered. In the absence of Coulomb interactions, a\nneglectable thermoelectric and heat currents is found identifying as the\nCoulomb blockade DQD regime. In the presence of Coulomb interactions, intra-\nand inter-Coulomb interactions, crossings energies between the intra- and the\ninter-dot many-body electron states are observed. The crossings induce extra\nchannels in the energy spectrum of the DQD that enhance thermoelectric and heat\ncurrents. The extra channels form several peaks in the thermoelectric and heat\ncurrents in which intensity and position of the peaks depend on strength of the\ninter- and intra-dot Coulomb interactions. In addition, the problem of\ncoherences and incoherences are studied using different approaches to the\nmaster equation, which are the first order von-Neumann, the Redfield, a first\norder Lindblad, and the Pauli methods. We find that all methods give almost\nsimilar thermal transport when the role of the coherences is irrelevant in the\nDQD.",

      "abstract": "Ad platforms require reliable measurement of advertising returns: what\nincrease in performance (such as clicks or conversions) can an advertiser\nexpect in return for additional budget on the platform? Even from the\nperspective of the platform, accurately measuring advertising returns is hard.\nSelection and omitted variable biases make estimates from observational methods\nunreliable, and straightforward experimentation is often costly or infeasible.\nWe introduce Asymmetric Budget Split, a novel methodology for valid measurement\nof ad returns from the perspective of the platform. Asymmetric budget split\ncreates small asymmetries in ad budget allocation across comparable partitions\nof the platform's userbase. By observing performance of the same ad at\ndifferent budget levels while holding all other factors constant, the platform\ncan obtain a valid measure of ad returns. The methodology is unobtrusive and\ncost-effective in that it does not require holdout groups or sacrifices in ad\nor marketplace performance. We discuss a successful deployment of asymmetric\nbudget split to LinkedIn's Jobs Marketplace, an ad marketplace where it is used\nto measure returns from promotion budgets in terms of incremental job\napplicants. We outline operational considerations for practitioners and discuss\nfurther use cases such as budget-aware performance forecasting.",

      "abstract": "Fault-tolerant quantum computing based on surface codes has emerged as a\npopular route to large-scale quantum computers capable of accurate computation\neven in the presence of noise. Its popularity is, in part, because the\nfault-tolerance or accuracy threshold for surface codes is believed to be less\nstringent than competing schemes. This threshold is the noise level below which\ncomputational accuracy can be increased by increasing physical resources for\nnoise removal, and is an important engineering target for realising quantum\ndevices. The current conclusions about surface code thresholds are, however,\ndrawn largely from studies of probabilistic noise. While a natural assumption,\ncurrent devices experience noise beyond such a model, raising the question of\nwhether conventional statements about the thresholds apply. Here, we attempt to\nextend past proof techniques to derive the fault-tolerance threshold for\nsurface codes subjected to general noise with no particular structure.\nSurprisingly, we found no nontrivial threshold, i.e., there is no guarantee the\nsurface code prescription works for general noise. While this is not a proof\nthat the scheme fails, we argue that current proof techniques are likely unable\nto provide an answer. A genuinely new idea is needed, to reaffirm the\nfeasibility of surface code quantum computing.",

For example, use of the standard supermolecular\nmethod with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) would require extremely\nprecise resolution of the total energies of the fragments to provide for\naccurate subtraction to the interaction energy. Here we present a\nsymmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) method that may provide interaction\nenergies with high quantum resource efficiency. Of particular note, we present\na quantum extended random-phase approximation (ERPA) treatment of the SAPT\nsecond-order induction and dispersion terms, including exchange counterparts.\nTogether with previous work on first-order terms, this provides a recipe for\ncomplete SAPT(VQE) interaction energies up to second order. The SAPT\ninteraction energy terms are computed as first-level observables with no\nsubtraction of monomer energies invoked, and the only quantum observations\nneeded are the the VQE one- and two-particle density matrices. We find\nempirically that SAPT(VQE) can provide accurate interaction energies even with\ncoarsely optimized, low circuit depth wavefunctions from the quantum computer,\nsimulated through ideal statevectors.

      "title": "Ranking Constraint Relaxations for Mixed Integer Programs Using a\n  Machine Learning Approach",
      "abstract": "Solving large-scale Mixed Integer Programs (MIP) can be difficult without\nadvanced algorithms such as decomposition based techniques. Even if a\ndecomposition technique might be appropriate, there are still many possible\ndecompositions for any large MIP and it may not be obvious which will be the\nmost effective. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the predictive\ncapabilities of a Machine Learning ranking (ML) function for predicting the\nquality of Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) decompositions created via\nconstraint relaxation. In this analysis, the role of instance similarity and ML\nprediction quality is explored, as well as the benchmarking of a ML ranking\nfunction against existing heuristic functions. For this analysis, a new dataset\nconsisting of over 40000 unique decompositions sampled from across 24 instances\nfrom the MIPLIB2017 library has been established. These decompostions have been\ncreated by both a greedy relaxation algorithm as well as a population based\nmulti-objective algorithm, which has previously been shown to produce high\nquality decompositions. In this paper, we demonstrate that a ML ranking\nfunction is able to provide state-of-the-art predictions when benchmarked\nagainst existing heuristic ranking functions. Additionally, we demonstrate that\nby only considering a small set of features related to the relaxed constraints\nin each decomposition, a ML ranking function is still able to be competitive\nwith heuristic techniques. Such a finding is promising for future constraint\nrelaxation approaches, as these features can be used to guide decomposition\ncreation. Finally, we highlight where a ML ranking function would be beneficial\nin a decomposition creation framework.",

In this study, we present three\ncausal inference models in the Bayesian framework and their corresponding cases\nto address three commonly experienced challenges of software evaluation in the\nautomotive domain. We develop the BOAT framework with our industry\ncollaborator, and demonstrate the potential of causal inference by conducting\nempirical studies on a large fleet of vehicles. Moreover, we relate the causal\nassumption theories to their implications in practise, aiming to provide a\ncomprehensive guide on how to apply the causal models in automotive software\nengineering. We apply Bayesian propensity score matching for producing balanced\ncontrol and treatment groups when we do not have access to the entire user\nbase, Bayesian regression discontinuity design for identifying covariate\ndependent treatment assignments and the local treatment effect, and Bayesian\ndifference-in-differences for causal inference of treatment effect overtime and\nimplicitly control unobserved confounding factors.

      "abstract": "The fog-radio-access-network (F-RAN) has been proposed to address the strict\nlatency requirements, which offloads computation tasks generated in user\nequipments (UEs) to the edge to reduce the processing latency. However, it\nincorporates the task transmission latency, which may become the bottleneck of\nlatency requirements. Data compression (DC) has been considered as one of the\npromising techniques to reduce the transmission latency. By compressing the\ncomputation tasks before transmitting, the transmission delay is reduced due to\nthe shrink transmitted data size, and the original computing task can be\nretrieved by employing data decompressing (DD) at the edge nodes or the centre\ncloud. Nevertheless, the DC and DD incorporate extra processing latency, and\nthe latency performance has not been investigated in the large-scale DC-enabled\nF-RAN. Therefore, in this work, the successful data compression probability\n(SDCP) is defined to analyse the latency performance of the F-RAN. Moreover, to\nanalyse the effect of compression offloading ratio (COR), a novel hybrid\ncompression mode is proposed based on the queueing theory. Based on this, the\nclosed-form result of SDCP in the large-scale DC-enabled F-RAN is derived by\ncombining the Matern cluster process and M/G/1 queueing model, and validated by\nMonte Carlo simulations. Based on the derived SDCP results, the effects of COR\non the SDCP is analysed numerically. The results show that the SDCP with the\noptimal COR can be enhanced with a maximum value of 0.3 and 0.55 as compared\nwith the cases of compressing all computing tasks at the edge and at the UE,\nrespectively. Moreover, for the system requiring the minimal latency, the\nproposed hybrid compression mode can alleviate the requirement on the backhaul\ncapacity.",

The frequency and the amplitude of the dithering tone\nshould both be as low as possible, in order to avoid undesired collateral\neffects on the received spectrum as well as keep at low levels the global\nenergy consumption.\n  Through a comprehensive analysis of dithered Radio over Fiber systems, it is\ndemonstrated that a progressive reduction of the dithering tone frequency\naffects in a peculiar fashion both the chirping characteristics of the field\nemitted by the laser and the spectrum pattern of the received signal at the\nfiber end.\n  Accounting for the concurrent effects caused by such phenomena, optimal\noperating conditions are identified for the implementation of the dithering\ntone technique in radioastronomic systems.",

In this contribution an optimized processing order is\nproposed for Frequency Selective Extrapolation, a powerful signal extrapolation\nalgorithm. Using this optimized order, the extrapolation can be carried out in\nparallel. The algorithm scales very good, resulting in an acceleration of a\nfactor of up to 7.7 for an eight core computer.

      "abstract": "This article seeks for a distributed learning solution for the visual\ntransformer (ViT) architectures. Compared to convolutional neural network (CNN)\narchitectures, ViTs often have larger model sizes, and are computationally\nexpensive, making federated learning (FL) ill-suited. Split learning (SL) can\ndetour this problem by splitting a model and communicating the hidden\nrepresentations at the split-layer, also known as smashed data.\nNotwithstanding, the smashed data of ViT are as large as and as similar as the\ninput data, negating the communication efficiency of SL while violating data\nprivacy. To resolve these issues, we propose a new form of CutSmashed data by\nrandomly punching and compressing the original smashed data. Leveraging this,\nwe develop a novel SL framework for ViT, coined CutMixSL, communicating\nCutSmashed data. CutMixSL not only reduces communication costs and privacy\nleakage, but also inherently involves the CutMix data augmentation, improving\naccuracy and scalability. Simulations corroborate that CutMixSL outperforms\nbaselines such as parallelized SL and SplitFed that integrates FL with SL.",

      "abstract": "Current stellar model predictions of adiabatic oscillation frequencies differ\nsignificantly from the corresponding observed frequencies due to the\nnon-adiabatic and poorly understood near-surface layers of stars. However,\ncertain combinations of frequencies -- known as frequency ratios -- are largely\nunaffected by the uncertain physical processes as they are mostly sensitive to\nthe stellar core. Furthermore, the seismic signature of helium ionization\nprovides envelope properties while being almost independent of the outermost\nlayers. We have developed an advanced stellar modelling approach in which we\ncomplement frequency ratios with parameters of the helium ionization zone while\ntaking into account all possible correlations to put the most stringent\nconstraints on the stellar internal structure. We have tested the method using\nthe Kepler benchmark star 16 Cyg A and have investigated the potential of the\nhelium glitch parameters to constrain the basic stellar properties in detail.\nIt has been explicitly shown that the initial helium abundance and\nmixing-length parameters are well constrained within our framework, reducing\nsystematic uncertainties on stellar mass and age arising for instance from the\nwell-known anti-correlation between the mass and initial helium abundance. The\nmodelling of six additional Kepler stars including 16 Cyg B reinforces the\nabove findings and also confirms that our approach is mostly independent from\nmodel uncertainties associated with the near-surface layers. Our method is\nrelatively computationally expensive, however, it provides stellar masses,\nradii and ages precisely in an automated manner, paving the way for analysing\nnumerous stars observed in the future during the ESA PLATO mission.",

We propose a novel approach to\nspeech enhancement aimed at improving perceptual quality and naturalness of\nenhanced signals by optimizing for key characteristics of speech. We first\nidentify key acoustic parameters that have been found to correlate well with\nvoice quality (e.g. jitter, shimmer, and spectral flux) and then propose\nobjective functions which are aimed at reducing the difference between clean\nspeech and enhanced speech with respect to these features. The full set of\nacoustic features is the extended Geneva Acoustic Parameter Set (eGeMAPS),\nwhich includes 25 different attributes associated with perception of speech.\nGiven the non-differentiable nature of these feature computation, we first\nbuild differentiable estimators of the eGeMAPS and then use them to fine-tune\nexisting speech enhancement systems. Our approach is generic and can be applied\nto any existing deep learning based enhancement systems to further improve the\nenhanced speech signals. Experimental results conducted on the Deep Noise\nSuppression (DNS) Challenge dataset shows that our approach can improve the\nstate-of-the-art deep learning based enhancement systems.",

Two coupling schemes for\nthe $s$-wave kaon-baryon interaction are compared regarding the onset density\nof kaon condensation in the hyperon-mixed matter and equation of state for the\ndeveloped ($Y+K$) phase: One is the contact interaction scheme related to the\nnonlinear effective chiral Lagrangian. The other is the meson-exchange scheme,\nwhere the interaction vertices between the kaon field and baryons are described\nby exchange of mesons (sigma, sigma^* mesons for scalar coupling, and omega,\nrho, phi mesons for vector coupling). It is shown that in the meson exchange\nscheme, the contribution from the nonlinear scalar self-interaction gives rise\nto a repulsive effect for kaon effective energy, pushing up the onset density\nof kaon condensation as compared with the case of the contact interaction\nscheme. In general, the difference of kaon-baryon dynamics between the contact\ninteraction scheme and the meson-exchange scheme relies on the specific forms\nof the nonlinear self-interacting meson terms. It is shown that the nonlinear\nself-interacting term is not relevant to repulsive energy leading to stiffening\nof the equation of state at high densities and that it cannot be compensated\nwith large attractive energy due to the appearance of the ($Y$+$K$) phase in\nthe case of the contact interaction scheme. We also discuss in the contact\ninteraction scheme what effects are necessary so as to make the equation of\nstate with (Y+K) phase stiff enough to be consistent with recent observations\nof massive neutron stars.",

      "abstract": "As the need for miniaturized structural and functional materials has\nincreased,the need for precise materials characterizaton has also expanded.\nNanoindentation is a popular method that can be used to measure material\nmechanical behavior which enables high-throughput experiments and, in some\ncases, can also provide images of the indented area through scanning. Both\nindenting and scanning can cause tip wear that can influence the measurements.\nTherefore, precise characterization of tip radii is needed to improve data\nevaluation. A data fusion method is introduced which uses finite element\nsimulations and experimental data to estimate the tip radius in situ in a\nmeaningful way using an interpretable multi-fidelity deep learning approach. By\ninterpreting the machine learning models, it is shown that the approaches are\nable to accurately capture physical indentation phenomena.",

      "title": "A New Riemann Solver for Modelling Bridges in Flood Flows -- Development\n  and Experimental Validation",
      "abstract": "Flows in rivers can be strongly affected by obstacles to flow or artificial\nstructures such as bridges, weirs and dams. This is especially true during\nfloods, where significant backwater effects or diversion of flow out of bank\ncan result. However, within contemporary industry practice, linear features\nsuch as bridges are often modelled using coarse approximations, empirically\nbased methods or are omitted entirely. Presented within this paper is a novel\nRiemann solver which is capable of modelling the influence of such features\nwithin hydrodynamic flood models using finite volume schemes to solve the\nshallow water equations. The solution procedure represents structures at the\ninterface between neighbouring cells and uses a combination of internal\nboundary conditions and a different form of the conservation laws in the\nadjacent cells to resolve numerical fluxes across the interface. Since the\nprocedure only applies to the cells adjacent to the interface at which a\nstructure is being modelled, the method is therefore potentially compatible\nwith existing hydrodynamic models. Comparisons with validation data collected\nfrom a state of the art research flume demonstrate that the solver is suitable\nfor modelling a range of flow conditions and structure configurations such as\nbridges and gates.",

      "abstract": "Although deep learning algorithms have been intensively developed for\ncomputer-aided tuberculosis diagnosis (CTD), they mainly depend on carefully\nannotated datasets, leading to much time and resource consumption. Weakly\nsupervised learning (WSL), which leverages coarse-grained labels to accomplish\nfine-grained tasks, has the potential to solve this problem. In this paper, we\nfirst propose a new large-scale tuberculosis (TB) chest X-ray dataset, namely\nthe tuberculosis chest X-ray attribute dataset (TBX-Att), and then establish an\nattribute-assisted weakly-supervised framework to classify and localize TB by\nleveraging the attribute information to overcome the insufficiency of\nsupervision in WSL scenarios. Specifically, first, the TBX-Att dataset contains\n2000 X-ray images with seven kinds of attributes for TB relational reasoning,\nwhich are annotated by experienced radiologists. It also includes the public\nTBX11K dataset with 11200 X-ray images to facilitate weakly supervised\ndetection. Second, we exploit a multi-scale feature interaction model for TB\narea classification and detection with attribute relational reasoning. The\nproposed model is evaluated on the TBX-Att dataset and will serve as a solid\nbaseline for future research. The code and data will be available at\nhttps://github.com/GangmingZhao/tb-attribute-weak-localization.",

      "abstract": "Despite being considered as the next frontier in computation, Quantum\nComputing is still in an early stage of development. Indeed, current commercial\nquantum computers suffer from some critical restraints, such as noisy processes\nand a limited amount of qubits, among others, that affect the performance of\nquantum algorithms. Despite these limitations, researchers have devoted much\neffort to propose different frameworks for efficiently using these Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. One of these procedures is D'WAVE\nSystems' quantum-annealer, which can be use to solve optimization problems by\ntranslating them into an energy minimization problem. In this context, this\nwork is focused on providing useful insights and information into the behaviour\nof the quantum-annealer when addressing real-world combinatorial optimization\nproblems. Our main motivation with this study is to open some quantum computing\nfrontiers to non-expert stakeholders. To this end, we perform an extensive\nexperimentation, in the form of a parameter sensitive analysis. This\nexperimentation has been conducted using the Traveling Salesman Problem as\nbenchmarking problem, and adopting two QUBOs: state-of-the-art and a\nheuristically generated. Our analysis has been performed on a single 7-noded\ninstance, and it is based on more than 200 different parameter configurations,\ncomprising more than 3700 unitary runs and 7 million of quantum reads. Thanks\nto this study, findings related to the energy distribution and most appropriate\nparameter settings have been obtained. Finally, an additional study has been\nperformed, aiming to determine the efficiency of the heuristically built QUBO\nin further TSP instances.",

However, the graph structure is mostly static and fails to represent\nthe temporal changes in highly dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose a\ntemporal graph representation to better capture the dynamics in traffic scenes.\nWe complement our representation with two types of memory modules; one focusing\non the agent of interest and the other on the entire scene. This allows us to\nlearn temporally-aware representations that can achieve good results even with\nsimple regression of multiple futures. When combined with goal-conditioned\nprediction, we show better results that can reach the state-of-the-art\nperformance on the Argoverse benchmark.",

However, predicting 6D\npose from single 2D image features is susceptible to disturbance from changing\nof environment and textureless or resemblant object surfaces. Hence, RGB-based\nmethods generally achieve less competitive results than RGBD-based methods,\nwhich deploy both image features and 3D structure features. To narrow down this\nperformance gap, this paper proposes a framework for 6D object pose estimation\nthat learns implicit 3D information from 2 RGB images. Combining the learned 3D\ninformation and 2D image features, we establish more stable correspondence\nbetween the scene and the object models. To seek for the methods best utilizing\n3D information from RGB inputs, we conduct an investigation on three different\napproaches, including Early- Fusion, Mid-Fusion, and Late-Fusion. We ascertain\nthe Mid- Fusion approach is the best approach to restore the most precise 3D\nkeypoints useful for object pose estimation.

      "title": "Effect of Homomorphic Encryption on the Performance of Training\n  Federated Learning Generative Adversarial Networks",
      "abstract": "A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a deep-learning generative model in\nthe field of Machine Learning (ML) that involves training two Neural Networks\n(NN) using a sizable data set. In certain fields, such as medicine, the\ntraining data may be hospital patient records that are stored across different\nhospitals. The classic centralized approach would involve sending the data to a\ncentralized server where the model would be trained. However, that would\ninvolve breaching the privacy and confidentiality of the patients and their\ndata, which would be unacceptable. Therefore, Federated Learning (FL), an ML\ntechnique that trains ML models in a distributed setting without data ever\nleaving the host device, would be a better alternative to the centralized\noption. In this ML technique, only parameters and certain metadata would be\ncommunicated. In spite of that, there still exist attacks that can infer user\ndata using the parameters and metadata. A fully privacy-preserving solution\ninvolves homomorphically encrypting (HE) the data communicated. This paper will\nfocus on the performance loss of training an FL-GAN with three different types\nof Homomorphic Encryption: Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE), Somewhat\nHomomorphic Encryption (SHE), and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). We will\nalso test the performance loss of Multi-Party Computations (MPC), as it has\nhomomorphic properties. The performances will be compared to the performance of\ntraining an FL-GAN without encryption as well. Our experiments show that the\nmore complex the encryption method is, the longer it takes, with the extra time\ntaken for HE is quite significant in comparison to the base case of FL.",

      "abstract": "Future industrial applications will encompass compelling new use cases\nrequiring stringent performance guarantees over multiple key performance\nindicators (KPI) such as reliability, dependability, latency, time\nsynchronization, security, etc. Achieving such stringent and diverse service\nrequirements necessitates the design of a special-purpose Industrial Internet\nof Things (IIoT) network comprising a multitude of specialized functionalities\nand technological enablers. This article proposes an innovative architecture\nfor such a special-purpose 6G IIoT network incorporating seven functional\nbuilding blocks categorized into: special-purpose functionalities and enabling\ntechnologies. The former consists of Wireless Environment Control,\nTraffic/Channel Prediction, Proactive Resource Management and End-to-End\nOptimization functions; whereas the latter includes Synchronization and\nCoordination, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Algorithms, and\nAuxiliary Functions. The proposed architecture aims at providing a\nresource-efficient and holistic solution for the complex and dynamically\nchallenging requirements imposed by future 6G industrial use cases.

      "abstract": "Suppressing the interference of atmospheric turbulence and obtaining\nobservation data with a high spatial resolution is an issue to be solved\nurgently for ground observations. One way to solve this problem is to perform a\nstatistical reconstruction of short-exposure speckle images. Combining the\nrapidity of Shift-Add and the accuracy of speckle masking, this paper proposes\na novel reconstruction algorithm-NASIR (Non-rigid Alignment based Solar Image\nReconstruction). NASIR reconstructs the phase of the object image at each\nfrequency by building a computational model between geometric distortion and\nintensity distribution and reconstructs the modulus of the object image on the\naligned speckle images by speckle interferometry. We analyzed the performance\nof NASIR by using the correlation coefficient, power spectrum, and coefficient\nof variation of intensity profile (CVoIP) in processing data obtained by the\nNVST (1m New Vacuum Solar Telescope). The reconstruction experiments and\nanalysis results show that the quality of images reconstructed by NASIR is\nclose to speckle masking when the seeing is good, while NASIR has excellent\nrobustness when the seeing condition becomes worse. Furthermore, NASIR\nreconstructs the entire field of view in parallel in one go, without phase\nrecursion and block-by-block reconstruction, so its computation time is less\nthan half that of speckle masking. Therefore, we consider NASIR is a robust and\nhigh-quality fast reconstruction method that can serve as an effective tool for\ndata filtering and quick look.",

At the transmitter side, each user is assigned a unique protocol\nsequence which is used to identify the user and also indicate the user's\nchannel access pattern. Hence, user identification is completed by the\ndetection of channel access patterns. Particularly, the columns of a parity\ncheck matrix of low-density-parity-check (LDPC) code are employed as protocol\nsequences. The design guideline of this LDPC parity check matrix and the\nassociated performance analysis are provided in this paper.At the receiver\nside, a two-stage iterative detection architecture is designed, which consists\nof a group testing component and a payload data decoding component. They\ncollaborate in a way that the group testing component maps detected protocol\nsequences to a tanner graph, on which the second component could execute its\nmessage passing algorithm. In turn, zero symbols detected by the message\npassing algorithm of the second component indicate potential false alarms made\nby the first group testing component. Hence, the tanner graph could iteratively\nevolve.The provided simulation results demonstrate that our transceiver design\nrealizes a practical one-step grant-free transmission and has a compelling\nperformance.",

      "abstract": "In many reacting flow systems, the thermo-chemical state-space is known or\nassumed to evolve close to a low-dimensional manifold (LDM). Various approaches\nare available to obtain those manifolds and subsequently express the original\nhigh-dimensional space with fewer parameterizing variables. Principal component\nanalysis (PCA) is one of the dimensionality reduction methods that can be used\nto obtain LDMs. PCA does not make prior assumptions about the parameterizing\nvariables and retrieves them empirically from the training data. In this paper,\nwe show that PCA applied in local clusters of data (local PCA) is capable of\ndetecting the intrinsic parameterization of the thermo-chemical state-space. We\nfirst demonstrate that utilizing three common combustion models of varying\ncomplexity: the Burke-Schumann model, the chemical equilibrium model and the\nhomogeneous reactor.

We further extend the\napplication of local PCA to a more challenging case of a turbulent non-premixed\n$n$-heptane/air jet flame for which the parameterization is no longer obvious.\nOur results suggest that meaningful parameterization can be obtained also for\nmore complex datasets.

      "abstract": "Due to its powerful feature learning capability and high efficiency, deep\nhashing has achieved great success in large-scale image retrieval. Meanwhile,\nextensive works have demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are\nsusceptible to adversarial examples, and exploring adversarial attack against\ndeep hashing has attracted many research efforts. Nevertheless, backdoor\nattack, another famous threat to DNNs, has not been studied for deep hashing\nyet. Although various backdoor attacks have been proposed in the field of image\nclassification, existing approaches failed to realize a truly imperceptive\nbackdoor attack that enjoys invisible triggers and clean label setting\nsimultaneously, and they also cannot meet the intrinsic demand of image\nretrieval backdoor. In this paper, we propose BadHash, the first\ngenerative-based imperceptible backdoor attack against deep hashing, which can\neffectively generate invisible and input-specific poisoned images with clean\nlabel. Specifically, we first propose a new conditional generative adversarial\nnetwork (cGAN) pipeline to effectively generate poisoned samples. For any given\nbenign image, it seeks to generate a natural-looking poisoned counterpart with\na unique invisible trigger. In order to improve the attack effectiveness, we\nintroduce a label-based contrastive learning network LabCLN to exploit the\nsemantic characteristics of different labels, which are subsequently used for\nconfusing and misleading the target model to learn the embedded trigger. We\nfinally explore the mechanism of backdoor attacks on image retrieval in the\nhash space. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify that\nBadHash can generate imperceptible poisoned samples with strong attack ability\nand transferability over state-of-the-art deep hashing schemes.",

      "abstract": "The problem of the large-scale aggregation of the behind-the-meter demand and\ngeneration resources by a distributed-energy-resource aggregator (DERA) is\nconsidered. As a profit-seeking wholesale market participant, a DERA maximizes\nits profit while providing competitive services to its customers with higher\nconsumer/prosumer surpluses than those offered by the distribution utilities or\ncommunity choice aggregators. A constrained profit maximization program for\naggregating behind-the-meter generation and consumption resources is\nformulated, from which payment functions for the behind-the-meter consumptions\nand generations are derived. Also obtained are DERA's bid and offer curves for\nits participation in the wholesale energy market and the optimal schedule of\nbehind-the-meter resources. It is shown that the proposed DERA's aggregation\nmodel can achieve market efficiency equivalent to that when its customers\nparticipate individually directly in the wholesale market.",

      "abstract": "Computational Law has begun taking the role in society which has been\npredicted for some time. Automated decision-making and systems which assist\nusers are now used in various jurisdictions, but with this maturity come\ncertain caveats. Computational Law exists on the platforms which enable it, in\nthis case digital systems, which means that it inherits the same flaws.\nCybersecurity addresses these potential weaknesses. In this paper we go through\nknown issues and discuss them in the various levels, from design to the\nphysical realm. We also look at machine-learning specific adversarial problems.\nAdditionally, we make certain considerations regarding computational law and\nexisting and future legislation. Finally, we present three recommendations\nwhich are necessary for computational law to function globally, and which\nfollow ideas in safety and security engineering. As indicated, we find that\ncomputational law must seriously consider that not only does it face the same\nrisks as other types of software and computer systems, but that failures within\nit may cause financial or physical damage, as well as injustice. Consequences\nof Computational Legal systems failing are greater than if they were merely\nsoftware and hardware. If the system employs machine-learning, it must take\nnote of the very specific dangers which this brings, of which data poisoning is\nthe classic example. Computational law must also be explicitly legislated for,\nwhich we show is not the case currently in the EU, and this is also true for\nthe cybersecurity aspects that will be relevant to it. But there is great hope\nin EU's proposed AI Act, which makes an important attempt at taking the\nspecific problems which Computational Law bring into the legal sphere.

Deep learning techniques adopt a frequentist\nframework, and are known to provide poorly calibrated decisions that do not\nreproduce the true uncertainty caused by limitations in the size of the\ntraining data. Bayesian learning, while in principle capable of addressing this\nshortcoming, is in practice impaired by model misspecification and by the\npresence of outliers. Both problems are pervasive in wireless communication\nsettings, in which the capacity of machine learning models is subject to\nresource constraints and training data is affected by noise and interference.\nIn this context, we explore the application of the framework of robust Bayesian\nlearning.

      "abstract": "Real bug fixes found in open source repositories seem to be the perfect\nsource for learning to localize and repair real bugs. However, the absence of\nlarge scale bug fix collections has made it difficult to effectively exploit\nreal bug fixes in the training of larger neural models in the past. In\ncontrast, artificial bugs -- produced by mutating existing source code -- can\nbe easily obtained at a sufficient scale and are therefore often preferred in\nthe training of existing approaches. Still, localization and repair models that\nare trained on artificial bugs usually underperform when faced with real bugs.\nThis raises the question whether bug localization and repair models trained on\nreal bug fixes are more effective in localizing and repairing real bugs.\n  We address this question by introducing RealiT, a pre-train-and-fine-tune\napproach for effectively learning to localize and repair real bugs from real\nbug fixes. RealiT is first pre-trained on a large number of artificial bugs\nproduced by traditional mutation operators and then fine-tuned on a smaller set\nof real bug fixes. Fine-tuning does not require any modifications of the\nlearning algorithm and hence can be easily adopted in various training\nscenarios for bug localization or repair (even when real training data is\nscarce). In addition, we found that training on real bug fixes with RealiT is\nempirically powerful by nearly doubling the localization performance of an\nexisting model on real bugs while maintaining or even improving the repair\nperformance.",

This mathematical framework captures how\nphysical couplings of the resulting effective theories behave near field space\nboundaries where the internal Calabi-Yau manifold degenerates. Below we\nsummarize the three parts in which this thesis is divided.\n  Part I introduces the techniques from asymptotic Hodge theory we used\nthroughout this thesis. We review the results of the nilpotent orbit theorem of\nSchmid and the multi-variable sl(2)-orbit theorem of Cattani, Kaplan and\nSchmid. This discussion is tailored to applications in string\ncompactifications, explaining how to describe important physical couplings such\nas K\\\"ahler potentials and flux superpotentials near boundaries in moduli\nspaces.\n  Part II discusses a geometrical application with the construction of general\nmodels for asymptotic periods. Taking the constraints imposed by asymptotic\nHodge theory as consistency principles, we develop new methods for constructing\nthese periods. We explicitly carry out our program for all possible one- and\ntwo-moduli boundaries.\n  Part III discusses two applications of asymptotic Hodge theory in string\ncompactifications. The first investigates bounds put by the Weak Gravity\nConjecture in the setting of 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity theories arising\nfrom Type IIB Calabi-Yau compactifications. The second application studies flux\npotentials in asymptotic regimes in complex structure moduli space, where we\ndevelop two schemes for moduli stabilization. The first scheme sets up an\napproximation procedure for finding flux vacua divided in three steps: the\nsl(2)-approximation, the nilpotent orbit approximation, and the fully corrected\nresult. The second scheme constructs flux vacua with a small flux\nsuperpotential by using essential exponential corrections controlled by\nasymptotic Hodge theory.",

A new aggregative equilibrium notion is presented and the\nstrategic behaviour of the agents is analysed under a receding horizon\nparadigm. The evolution of the strategies predicted and implemented by the\nplayers over time is modelled through a discrete-time multi-valued dynamical\nsystem. By considering Lyapunov stability notions and applying limit and\ninvariance results for set-valued correspondences, necessary conditions are\nderived for convergence of a receding horizon map to a periodic equilibrium of\nthe aggregative game. This result is achieved for any (feasible) initial\ncondition, thus ensuring implicit adaptivity of the proposed control framework\nto real-time variations in the number and parameters of players.

The tadpole scheme\nmatters in higher-order predictions of observables if not all free parameters\nare fixed by renormalization conditions based on S-matrix elements, such as in\nMSbar renormalization. In contrast to previously used tadpole schemes, the GIVS\nunifies the properties of gauge invariance and perturbative stability. The\napplication of the GIVS to the Standard Model, for instance, leads to very\nmoderate electroweak corrections in the conversion of on-shell-renormalized to\nMSbar-renormalized masses. Moreover, in models with extended Higgs sectors, the\nGIVS is less prone to perturbative instabilities in the MSbar renormalization\nof Higgs mixing angles than observed for the traditional gauge-independent\ntadpole treatment.

In order to avoid\nthe well known instability phenomenon, we consider the so-called Minlos-Faddeev\nregularization of such Hamiltonian, heuristically corresponding to the\nintroduction of a three-body repulsion. We review the main concerning results\nrecently obtained. In particular, starting from a suitable quadratic form $Q$,\nthe self-adjoint and bounded from below Hamiltonian $\\mathcal H$ can be\nconstructed provided that the strength $\\gamma$ of the three-body force is\nlarger than a threshold parameter $\\gamma_c$. Moreover, we give an alternative\nand much simpler proof of the above result whenever $\\gamma > \\gamma'_c$, with\n$\\gamma'_c$ strictly larger than $\\gamma_c$. Finally, we show that the\nthreshold value $\\gamma_c$ is optimal, in the sense that the quadratic form $Q$\nis unbounded from below if $\\gamma<\\gamma_c$.",

      "abstract": "Observations of gaseous complex organic molecules (COMs) in cold starless and\nprestellar cloud cores require efficient desorption of the COMs and their\nparent species from icy mantles on interstellar grains. With a simple\nastrochemical model, we investigate if mechanical removal of ice fragments in\noblique collisions between grains in two size bins (0.01 and 0.1 micron) can\nsubstantially affect COM abundances. Two grain collision velocities were\nconsidered - 10 and 50 meters per second, corresponding to realistic grain\nrelative speeds arising from ambipolar diffusion and turbulence, respectively.\nFrom the smaller grains, the collisions are assumed to remove a spherical cap\nwith height equal to 1/3 and 1 ice mantle thickness, respectively. We find that\nthe turbulence-induced desorption can elevate the gas-phase abundances of COMs\nby several orders of magnitude, reproducing observed COM abundances within an\norder of magnitude. Importantly, the high gaseous COM abundances are attained\nfor long time-scales of up to 1 Myr and for a rather low methanol ice\nabundance, common for starless cores. The simple model, considering only two\ngrain size bins and several assumptions, demonstrates a concept that must be\ntested with a more sophisticated approach.",

      "abstract": "The situation calculus logic model is convenient for modelling the actions\nthat can occur in an information system application. The interplay of\npre-conditions and post-conditions determines a semantically justified partial\norder of the defined actions and serves to enforce integrity constraints. This\nform of specification allows the use of plan-generation algorithms to\ninvestigate, before the system is adopted, whether the proposed specification\nallows all desirable use cases, and effectively disallows undesirable ones.\nEspecially for legacy applications, implemented without a prior specification,\nProcess Mining techniques were employed to derive an implicit Petri net model\nfrom the analysis of a large number of traces registered in an execution log.\nHowever, if the system just begins to be used, and has a still empty execution\nlog, this sort of process mining discovery would not be feasible. This paper\nexplains how the Petri net model can be directly derived from the situation\ncalculus specification rules. The main gist is to provide evidence that the two\nmodels are complementary, not only because the Petri net model is derivable\nfrom the situation calculus model, but also in view of the distinct advantages\nof the two models. While the situation calculus model leads to planning and\nsimulated execution prior to implementation, the Petri net model can be\ndesigned to run in a restrictive mode, allowing an intuitive visualization of\nthe workable sequences. As proof of concept, the paper describes a prototype to\ndemonstrate the methods and applies it to two examples: a published request\nprocessing application used to introduce process mining notions; and an\nanalogously structured trial by combat application taken from a popular movie.\nThe prototype includes an interactive dramatization component, which enacts the\nsecond application.",

      "abstract": "Dark matter (DM) occupies the majority of matter content in the universe and\nis probably cold (CDM). However, modifications to the standard CDM model may be\nrequired by the small-scale observations, and DM may be self-interacting (SIDM)\nor warm (WDM). Here we show that the diffractive lensing of gravitational waves\n(GWs) from binary black hole mergers by small halos ($\\sim10^3-10^6M_\\odot$;\nmini-halos) may serve as a clean probe to the nature of DM, free from the\ncontamination of baryonic processes in the DM studies based on dwarf/satellite\ngalaxies. The expected lensed GW signals and event rates resulting from CDM,\nWDM, and SIDM models are significantly different from each other, because of\nthe differences in halo density profiles and abundances predicted by these\nmodels. We estimate the detection rates of such lensed GW events for a number\nof current and future GW detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational Observatories (LIGO), the Einstein Telescope (ET), the Cosmic\nExplorer (CE), Gravitational-wave Lunar Observatory for Cosmology (GLOC), the\nDeci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (DECIGO), and the Big\nBang Observer (BBO). We find that GLOC may detect one such events per year\nassuming the CDM model, DECIGO (BBO) may detect more than several (hundreds of)\nsuch events per year, by assuming the CDM, WDM (with mass $>30$\\,keV) or SIDM\nmodel, suggesting that the DM nature may be strongly constrained by DECIGO and\nBBO via the detection of diffractive lensed GW events by mini-halos. Other GW\ndetectors are unlikely to detect a significant number of such events within a\nlimited observational time period. However, if the inner slope of the mini-halo\ndensity profile is sufficiently steeper than the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)\nprofile, e.g., the pseudo-Jaffe profile, one may be able to detect one to more\nthan hundred such GW events by ET and CE.",

One of the principal aims of our\nwork is to enable extensive transport theory applications that accounts fully\nfor the interplay between electric-field-induced interband and intraband\ncoherence, and Bloch-state scattering. The quasiparticle bands are treated in a\ncompletely general manner that allows for arbitrary forms of the intrinsic\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) and could be extended to the extrinsic SOC. According\nto the previous results, in the presence of the disorder potential, the\ninterband response in conductors in addition to an intrinsic contribution due\nto the entire Fermi sea that captures, among other effects, the Berry curvature\ncontribution to wave-packet dynamics includes an anomalous contribution caused\nby scattering that is sensitive to the presence of the Fermi surface. To\ndemonstrate the rich physics captured by our theory, the relaxation time matrix\nfor different strength order is considered and at the same time we explicitly\nsolve for some electric-field response properties of simple disordered Rashba\nmodel that are known to be dominated by interband coherence contributions.

      "abstract": "Intelligent test requires efficient and effective analysis of\nhigh-dimensional data in a large scale. Traditionally, the analysis is often\nconducted by human experts, but it is not scalable in the era of big data. To\ntackle this challenge, variable selection has been recently introduced to\nintelligent test. However, in practice, we encounter scenarios where certain\nvariables (e.g. some specific processing conditions for a device under test)\nmust be maintained after variable selection. We call this conditional variable\nselection, which has not been well investigated for embedded or\ndeep-learning-based variable selection methods. In this paper, we discuss a\nnovel conditional variable selection framework that can select the most\nimportant candidate variables given a set of preselected variables.",

We uniformly collected the\nobservational material with the 6-m telescope BTA of the Special Astrophysical\nObservatory in 2013-2021. We identify 14 new magnetic CP stars with a\nlongitudinal magnetic field exceeding approximately 500 G. The studied sample\ncontains 31 magnetic stars or 55% of the whole CP population in Orion OB1. We\nshow that the percentage of the magnetic CP stars and the field strength drops\nsharply with age. The mean longitudinal magnetic field in the young subgroup\nOB1b ($\\log t=6.23$) is confidently almost three times stronger than in the\nolder subgroups OB1a ($\\log t=7.05$) and OB1c ($\\log t=6.66$). In the Orion\nNebula, a place with the youngest stellar population ($\\log t < 6.0$), we\ndetect the magnetic field only in 20% of CP stars. Such occurrence drastically\ndiffers from 83% of magnetic CP stars in the nearby subgroup OB1c. We consider\nthis effect an observational bias caused by a significant portion of a very\nyoung population with the signatures of Herbig Ae/Be stars. The technique we\nused for magnetic measurements, and the quality of available data do not allow\nus to detect weak fields in the case of stars with a limited number of lines\nand emissions in spectra.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a new automatic evaluation method for speaker similarity\nassessment, that is consistent with human perceptual scores. Modern neural\ntext-to-speech models require a vast amount of clean training data, which is\nwhy many solutions switch from single speaker models to solutions trained on\nexamples from many different speakers. Multi-speaker models bring new\npossibilities, such as a faster creation of new voices, but also a new problem\n- speaker leakage, where the speaker identity of a synthesized example might\nnot match those of the target speaker. Currently, the only way to discover this\nissue is through costly perceptual evaluations. In this work, we propose an\nautomatic method for assessment of speaker similarity. For that purpose, we\nextend the recent work on speaker verification systems and evaluate how\ndifferent metrics and speaker embeddings models reflect Multiple Stimuli with\nHidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) scores. Our experiments show that we can\ntrain a model to predict speaker similarity MUSHRA scores from speaker\nembeddings with 0.96 accuracy and significant correlation up to 0.78 Pearson\nscore at the utterance level.",

      "title": "Fine-grained Correlation Loss for Regression",
      "abstract": "Regression learning is classic and fundamental for medical image analysis. It\nprovides the continuous mapping for many critical applications, like the\nattribute estimation, object detection, segmentation and non-rigid\nregistration. However, previous studies mainly took the case-wise criteria,\nlike the mean square errors, as the optimization objectives. They ignored the\nvery important population-wise correlation criterion, which is exactly the\nfinal evaluation metric in many tasks. In this work, we propose to revisit the\nclassic regression tasks with novel investigations on directly optimizing the\nfine-grained correlation losses. We mainly explore two complementary\ncorrelation indexes as learnable losses: Pearson linear correlation (PLC) and\nSpearman rank correlation (SRC). The contributions of this paper are two folds.\nFirst, for the PLC on global level, we propose a strategy to make it robust\nagainst the outliers and regularize the key distribution factors. These efforts\nsignificantly stabilize the learning and magnify the efficacy of PLC. Second,\nfor the SRC on local level, we propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to ease the\nlearning of the exact ranking order among samples. Specifically, we convert the\nlearning for the ranking of samples into the learning of similarity\nrelationships among samples. We extensively validate our method on two typical\nultrasound image regression tasks, including the image quality assessment and\nbio-metric measurement. Experiments prove that, with the fine-grained guidance\nin directly optimizing the correlation, the regression performances are\nsignificantly improved. Our proposed correlation losses are general and can be\nextended to more important applications.",

In particular, we focus on its impact when the maximum dust size\nsignificantly increases from sub-micron. The first half of the paper describes\nour calculation method for magnetic resistivity based on the model of\n\\citet{1987ApJ...320..803D} and shows that the method reproduces the results of\na more realistic chemical reaction network calculations reasonably well. Then,\nwe describe the results of the resistivity calculations for dust distributions\nwith large maximum dust grains. Our results show that resistivity tends to\ndecrease with dust growth, which is particularly true when the dust size power\nexponent $q$ is $q=2.5$. On the other hand, the decrease is less pronounced\nwhen the dust size power exponent $q$ is $q=3.5$, i.e., when the small dust is\nalso responsible for the dust cross-section. Our results suggest that detailed\ndust coagulation and fragmentation processes play a vital role in the magnetic\nresistivities in protostar formation.",

      "abstract": "Systematic variation is a common issue in metabolomics data analysis.\nTherefore, different scaling and normalization techniques are used to\npreprocess the data for metabolomics data analysis. Although several scaling\nmethods are available in the literature, however, choice of scaling,\ntransformation and/or normalization technique influence the further statistical\nanalysis. It is challenging to choose the appropriate scaling technique for\ndownstream analysis to get accurate results or to make a proper decision.\nMoreover, the existing scaling techniques are sensitive to outliers or extreme\nvalues. To fill the gap, our objective is to introduce a robust scaling\napproach that is not influenced by outliers as well as provides more accurate\nresults for downstream analysis. Here, we introduced a new weighted scaling\napproach that is robust against outliers however, where no additional outlier\ndetection/treatment step is needed in data preprocessing and also compared it\nwith the conventional scaling and normalization techniques through artificial\nand real metabolomics datasets. We evaluated the performance of the proposed\nmethod in comparison to the other existing conventional scaling techniques\nusing metabolomics data analysis in both the absence and presence of different\npercentages of outliers. Results show that in most cases, the proposed scaling\ntechnique performs better than the traditional scaling methods in both the\nabsence and presence of outliers. The proposed method improves the further\ndownstream metabolomics analysis.

      "abstract": "Influence maximization aims to select k most-influential vertices or seeds in\na network, where influence is defined by a given diffusion process. Although\ncomputing optimal seed set is NP-Hard, efficient approximation algorithms\nexist. However, even state-of-the-art parallel implementations are limited by a\nsampling step that incurs large memory footprints. This in turn limits the\nproblem size reach and approximation quality. In this work, we study the memory\nfootprint of the sampling process collecting reverse reachability information\nin the IMM (Influence Maximization via Martingales) algorithm over large\nreal-world social networks. We present a memory-efficient optimization approach\n(called HBMax) based on Ripples, a state-of-the-art multi-threaded parallel\ninfluence maximization solution. Our approach, HBMax, uses a portion of the\nreverse reachable (RR) sets collected by the algorithm to learn the\ncharacteristics of the graph. Then, it compresses the intermediate reverse\nreachability information with Huffman coding or bitmap coding, and queries on\nthe partially decoded data, or directly on the compressed data to preserve the\nmemory savings obtained through compression. Considering a NUMA architecture,\nwe scale up our solution on 64 CPU cores and reduce the memory footprint by up\nto 82.1% with average 6.3% speedup (encoding overhead is offset by performance\ngain from memory reduction) without loss of accuracy. For the largest tested\ngraph Twitter7 (with 1.4 billion edges), HBMax achieves 5.9X compression ratio\nand 2.2X speedup.",

      "abstract": "The challenge of fine-grained visual recognition often lies in discovering\nthe key discriminative regions. While such regions can be automatically\nidentified from a large-scale labeled dataset, a similar method might become\nless effective when only a few annotations are available. In low data regimes,\na network often struggles to choose the correct regions for recognition and\ntends to overfit spurious correlated patterns from the training data. To tackle\nthis issue, this paper proposes the self-boosting attention mechanism, a novel\nmethod for regularizing the network to focus on the key regions shared across\nsamples and classes. Specifically, the proposed method first generates an\nattention map for each training image, highlighting the discriminative part for\nidentifying the ground-truth object category. Then the generated attention maps\nare used as pseudo-annotations. The network is enforced to fit them as an\nauxiliary task. We call this approach the self-boosting attention mechanism\n(SAM). We also develop a variant by using SAM to create multiple attention maps\nto pool convolutional maps in a style of bilinear pooling, dubbed SAM-Bilinear.\nThrough extensive experimental studies, we show that both methods can\nsignificantly improve fine-grained visual recognition performance on low data\nregimes and can be incorporated into existing network architectures.

      "abstract": "Identifying influencers in a given social network has become an important\nresearch problem for various applications, including accelerating the spread of\ninformation in viral marketing and preventing the spread of fake news and\nrumors. The literature contains a rich body of studies on identifying\ninfluential source spreaders who can spread their own messages to many other\nnodes. In contrast, the identification of influential brokers who can spread\nother nodes' messages to many nodes has not been fully explored. Theoretical\nand empirical studies suggest that involvement of both influential source\nspreaders and brokers is a key to facilitating large-scale information\ndiffusion cascades. Therefore, this paper explores ways to identify influential\nbrokers from a given social network. By using three social media datasets, we\ninvestigate the characteristics of influential brokers by comparing them with\ninfluential source spreaders and central nodes obtained from centrality\nmeasures. Our results show that (i) most of the influential source spreaders\nare not influential brokers (and vice versa) and (ii) the overlap between\ncentral nodes and influential brokers is small (less than 15%) in Twitter\ndatasets. We also tackle the problem of identifying influential brokers from\ncentrality measures and node embeddings, and we examine the effectiveness of\nsocial network features in the broker identification task. Our results show\nthat (iii) although a single centrality measure cannot characterize influential\nbrokers well, prediction models using node embedding features achieve F$_1$\nscores of 0.35--0.68, suggesting the effectiveness of social network features\nfor identifying influential brokers.",

To address the challenge, we propose \\textbf{DictBERT}, a novel approach\nthat enhances PLMs with dictionary knowledge which is easier to acquire than\nknowledge graph (KG). During pre-training, we present two novel pre-training\ntasks to inject dictionary knowledge into PLMs via contrastive learning:\n\\textit{dictionary entry prediction} and \\textit{entry description\ndiscrimination}. In fine-tuning, we use the pre-trained DictBERT as a plugin\nknowledge base (KB) to retrieve implicit knowledge for identified entries in an\ninput sequence, and infuse the retrieved knowledge into the input to enhance\nits representation via a novel extra-hop attention mechanism. We evaluate our\napproach on a variety of knowledge driven and language understanding tasks,\nincluding NER, relation extraction, CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA and GLUE.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our model can significantly improve\ntypical PLMs: it gains a substantial improvement of 0.5\\%, 2.9\\%, 9.0\\%, 7.1\\%\nand 3.3\\% on BERT-large respectively, and is also effective on RoBERTa-large.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the sum spectral efficiency maximization problem in\ndownlink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with\nlow-resolution quantizers at an access point (AP) and users. In particular, we\nconsider rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) to enhance spectral efficiency\nby offering opportunities to boost achievable degrees of freedom. Optimizing\nRSMA precoders, however, is highly challenging due to the minimum rate\nconstraint when determining the rate of the common stream. The quantization\nerrors coupled with the precoders further make the problem more complicated and\ndifficult to solve. In this paper, we develop a novel RSMA precoding algorithm\nincorporating quantization errors for maximizing the sum spectral efficiency.\nTo this end, we first obtain an approximate spectral efficiency in a smooth\nfunction. Subsequently, we derive the first-order optimality condition in the\nform of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEP). We propose a computationally\nefficient algorithm to find the principal eigenvector of the NEP as a\nsub-optimal solution. Simulation results validate the superior spectral\nefficiency of the proposed method. The key benefit of using RSMA over spatial\ndivision multiple access (SDMA) comes from the ability of the common stream to\nbalance between the channel gain and quantization error in multiuser MIMO\nsystems with different quantization resolutions.",

      "abstract": "Removing bias while keeping all task-relevant information is challenging for\nfair representation learning methods since they would yield random or\ndegenerate representations w.r.t. labels when the sensitive attributes\ncorrelate with labels. Existing works proposed to inject the label information\ninto the learning procedure to overcome such issues. However, the assumption\nthat the observed labels are clean is not always met. In fact, label bias is\nacknowledged as the primary source inducing discrimination. In other words, the\nfair pre-processing methods ignore the discrimination encoded in the labels\neither during the learning procedure or the evaluation stage. This\ncontradiction puts a question mark on the fairness of the learned\nrepresentations. To circumvent this issue, we explore the following question:\n\\emph{Can we learn fair representations predictable to latent ideal fair labels\ngiven only access to unreliable labels?} In this work, we propose a\n\\textbf{D}e-\\textbf{B}iased \\textbf{R}epresentation Learning for\n\\textbf{F}airness (DBRF) framework which disentangles the sensitive information\nfrom non-sensitive attributes whilst keeping the learned representations\npredictable to ideal fair labels rather than observed biased ones. We formulate\nthe de-biased learning framework through information-theoretic concepts such as\nmutual information and information bottleneck. The core concept is that DBRF\nadvocates not to use unreliable labels for supervision when sensitive\ninformation benefits the prediction of unreliable labels. Experiment results\nover both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that DBRF effectively\nlearns de-biased representations towards ideal labels.",

Thus, only the light scattering\nprocesses persist. However, the situation might be different in the case of\ncomposite bosons or the bosons with an internal structure. Here, we develop a\nmicroscopic theory of electromagnetic power absorption by a Bose-Einstein\ncondensates of cold atoms in various dimensions, utilizing the Bogoliubov model\nof a weakly-interacting Bose gas. Thus, we address the transitions between a\ncollective coherent state of bosons and the discrete energy levels\ncorresponding to excited internal degrees of freedom of non-condensed\nindividual bosons. It is shown, that such transitions are mediated by one and\ntwo-bogolon excitations above the condensate, which demonstrate different\nefficiency at different frequencies and strongly depend on the condensate\ndensity, which influence varies depending on the dimensionality of the system.",

      "abstract": "Most reinforcement learning methods for adaptive-traffic-signal-control\nrequire training from scratch to be applied on any new intersection or after\nany modification to the road network, traffic distribution, or behavioral\nconstraints experienced during training. Considering 1) the massive amount of\nexperience required to train such methods, and 2) that experience must be\ngathered by interacting in an exploratory fashion with real road-network-users,\nsuch a lack of transferability limits experimentation and applicability. Recent\napproaches enable learning policies that generalize for unseen road-network\ntopologies and traffic distributions, partially tackling this challenge.\nHowever, the literature remains divided between the learning of cyclic (the\nevolution of connectivity at an intersection must respect a cycle) and acyclic\n(less constrained) policies, and these transferable methods 1) are only\ncompatible with cyclic constraints and 2) do not enable coordination. We\nintroduce a new model-based method, MuJAM, which, on top of enabling explicit\ncoordination at scale for the first time, pushes generalization further by\nallowing a generalization to the controllers' constraints. In a zero-shot\ntransfer setting involving both road networks and traffic settings never\nexperienced during training, and in a larger transfer experiment involving the\ncontrol of 3,971 traffic signal controllers in Manhattan, we show that MuJAM,\nusing both cyclic and acyclic constraints, outperforms domain-specific\nbaselines as well as another transferable approach.",

      "abstract": "A system consisting of a doubly clamped beam with an attached body (slider)\nfree to move along the beam has been studied recently by multiple research\ngroups. Under harmonic base excitation, the system has the capacity to\npassively adapt itself (by slowly changing the slider position) to yield either\nhigh or low vibrations. The central contributions of this work are the\nrefinement of the recently developed system model with regard to the finite\nstiffness of the beam's clamping, followed by a thorough validation of this\nmodel against experimental results. With the intent to achieve repeatable and\nrobust self-adaption, a new prototype of the system was designed, featuring, in\nparticular, a continuously adjustable gap size and a concave inner contact\ngeometry. The initial beam model is updated based on the results of an\nExperimental Nonlinear Modal Analysis of the system (without slider). By\nvarying the excitation level and frequency in a wide range, all known types of\nbehavior were reproduced in the experiment. The simulation results of the\nupdated model with slider are in excellent agreement with the measurements,\nboth qualitatively (type of behavior) and quantitatively. Minor deviations are\nattributed to the system's sensitivity to inevitable uncertainties, in\nparticular with regard to the friction coefficient and the linear natural\nfrequency. It is thus concluded that the proposed model is well-suited for\nfurther analysis of its intriguing dynamics and for model-based optimization\nfor technical applications such as energy harvesting.",

This fact challenges the current\ntechnologies to achieve carbon-lean steel production and to align with the\nrequirement of a drastic reduction of 80% in all CO2 emissions by around 2050.\nThus, alternative reduction technologies have to be implemented for extracting\niron from its ores. The H-based direct reduction has been explored as a\nsustainable route to mitigate CO2 emissions, where the reduction kinetics of\nthe intermediate oxide product FexO wustite into Fe is the rate-limiting step\nof the process. The total reaction has an endothermic net energy balance.\nReduction based on a H plasma may offer an attractive alternative. Here, we\npresent a study about the reduction of hematite using H plasma. The evolution\nof both, chemical composition and phase transformations was investigated in\nseveral intermediate states. We found that hematite reduction kinetics depends\non the balance between the initial input mass and the arc power. For an\noptimized input mass-arc power ratio, complete reduction was obtained within 15\nmin of exposure to the H plasma. The wustite reduction is also the\nrate-limiting step towards complete reduction. Nonetheless, the reduction\nreaction is exothermic, and its rates are comparable with those found in\nH-based direct reduction. Chemical and microstructure analysis revealed that\nthe gangue elements partition to the remaining oxide regions, probed by energy\ndispersive spectroscopy and atom probe tomography. Si-enrichment was observed\nin the interdendritic fayalite domains, at the wustite/Fe hetero-interfaces and\nin the primarily solidified oxide particles inside the Fe. With proceeding\nreduction, however, such elements are gradually removed from the samples so\nthat the final iron product is nearly free of gangue-related impurities.",

Anal. 233 (2019), 167--247) via an energetic variational\napproach. Actually, the related problem can be seen as a transmission problem\nfor the phase variable in the bulk and the corresponding variable on the\nboundary. The asymptotic behavior as the coefficient of the surface diffusion\nacting on the boundary phase variable goes to 0 is investigated. By this\nanalysis we obtain a forward-backward dynamic boundary condition at the limit.\nWe can deal with a general class of potentials having a double-well structure,\nincluding the non-smooth double-obstacle potential. We illustrate that the\nlimit problem is well-posed by also proving a continuous dependence estimate.\nMoreover, in the case when the two graphs, in the bulk and on the boundary,\nexhibit the same growth, we show that the solution of the limit problem is more\nregular and we prove an error estimate for a suitable order of the diffusion\nparameter.",

      "abstract": "Non-robust (fragile) test execution is a commonly reported challenge in\nGUI-based test automation, despite much research and several proposed\nsolutions. A test script needs to be resilient to (minor) changes in the tested\napplication but, at the same time, fail when detecting potential issues that\nrequire investigation. Test script fragility is a multi-faceted problem, but\none crucial challenge is reliably identifying and locating the correct target\nweb elements when the website evolves between releases or otherwise fails and\nreports an issue. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel approach called\nsimilarity-based web element localization (Similo), which leverages information\nfrom multiple web element locator parameters to identify a target element using\na weighted similarity score. The experimental study compares Similo to a\nbaseline approach for web element localization. To get an extensive empirical\nbasis, we target 40 of the most popular websites on the Internet in our\nevaluation. Robustness is considered by counting the number of web elements\nfound in a recent website version compared to how many of these existed in an\nolder version. Results of the experiment show that Similo outperforms the\nbaseline representing the current state-of-the-art; it failed to locate the\ncorrect target web element in 72 out of 598 considered cases compared to 146\nfailed cases for the baseline approach. This study presents evidence that\nquantifying the similarity between multiple attributes of web elements when\ntrying to locate them, as in our proposed Similo approach, is beneficial. With\nacceptable efficiency, Similo gives significantly higher effectiveness (i.e.,\nrobustness) than the baseline web element localization approach.",

Our analysis of TAI publications reveals numerous\norientations which differ in terms of who is doing the trusting (agent), in\nwhat (object), on the basis of what (basis), in order to what (objective), and\nwhy (impact). We develop an ontology that encapsulates these key axes of\ndifference to a) illuminate seeming inconsistencies across the literature and\nb) more effectively manage a dizzying number of TAI considerations.

      "abstract": "We present a rare event sampling scheme applicable to coupled electronic\nexcited states. In particular, we extend the forward flux sampling (FFS) method\nfor rare event sampling to a nonadiabatic version (NAFFS) that uses the\ntrajectory surface hopping (TSH) method for nonadiabatic dynamics. NAFFS is\napplied to two dynamically relevant excited-state models that feature an\navoided crossing and a conical intersection with tunable parameters. We\ninvestigate how nonadiabatic couplings, temperature, and reaction barriers\naspect transition rate constants in regimes that cannot be otherwise obtained\nwith plain, traditional TSH. The comparison with reference brute-force TSH\nsimulations for limiting cases of rareness shows that NAFFS can be several\norders of magnitude cheaper than conventional TSH, and thus represents a\nconceptually novel tool to extend excited-state dynamics to time scales that\nare able to capture rare nonadiabatic events.",

Regarding global $p-$refinement, $p=2$ exhibits the best\naccuracy/performance trade-off. Selective $p$-refinement might offer a better\ncompromise between accuracy and computational cost. However, for $p-$refinement\nat different entities, the best refinement scheme consists of using $p=3$ at\nthe volume level with $p=1$ at faces and edges. Thus, $p-$refinement can be\ncompetitive if applied hierarchically. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the\nperformance of our supervised $h+p$ refinement strategy depends on the input\nmodel (e.g., conductivity, frequency, domain decomposition strategy, among\nothers).

      "abstract": "We consider the largest sample of 561 edge-on galaxies observed with integral\nfield units by the MaNGA survey and find 300 galaxies where the ionised gas\nshows a negative vertical gradient (lag) in its rotational speed. We introduce\nthe stop altitude as the distance to the galactic midplane at which the gas\nrotation should stop in the linear approximation. We find correlations between\nthe lags, stop altitude and galactic mass, stellar velocity dispersion and\noverall Sersic index. We do not find any correlation of the lags or stop\naltitude with the star formation activity in the galaxies. We conclude that low\nmass galaxies (log(M*/Mo) < 10) with low Sersic index and with low stellar\nvelocity dispersion posses a wider \"zone of influence\" in the extragalactic gas\nsurrounding them with respect to higher mass galaxies that have a significant\nspherical component. We estimated the trend of the vertical rotational gradient\nwith radius and find it flat for most of the galaxies in our sample. A small\nsubsample of galaxies with negative radial gradients of lag has an enhanced\nfraction of objects with aged low surface brightness structures around them\n(e.g. faint shells), which indicates that noticeable accretion events in the\npast affected the extraplanar gas kinematics and might have contributed to\nnegative radial lag gradients. We conclude that an isotropic accretion of gas\nfrom the circumgalactic medium plays a significant role in the formation of\nrotation velocity lags.",

To that end, volumetric mesh is filtered by the solution of\npseudo-solid governing equations which are stiffened by the mesh-Jacobian and\nendowed with the Robin boundary condition which involves the Laplace-Beltrami\noperator on the mesh boundaries. Its superior performance from the\nnon-simultaneous (sequential) treatment of boundary and internal meshes is\ndemonstrated for the shape optimization of a complex solid structure.\nWell-established explicit filters, namely Gaussian and linear, and the\nHelmholtz/Sobolev-based (implicit) filter are critically examined in terms of\nconsistency (rigid-body-movement production), geometric characteristics and the\ncomputational cost. It is shown that the implicit filtering is numerically more\nefficient and unconditionally consistent, compared to the explicit one.\nSupported by numerical experiments, a regularized Green's function is\nintroduced as an equivalent explicit form of the Helmholtz/Sobolev filter.\nFurthermore, we give special attention to derive mesh-independent filtered\nsensitivities for node-based shape optimization with non-uniform meshes.

To address this hot\nissue, we propose a novel calibration method based on an unscented Kalman\nfilter and variable step-size Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. This work has\nthree ideas: a) proposing a novel variable step-size Levenberg-Marquardt\nalgorithm to addresses the issue of local optimum in a Levenberg-Marquardt\nalgorithm; b) employing an unscented Kalman filter to reduce the influence of\nthe measurement noises; and c) developing a novel calibration method\nincorporating an unscented Kalman filter with a variable step-size\nLevenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Furthermore, we conduct enough experiments on an\nABB IRB 120 industrial robot.

We study,\nby simulation, bias and coverage of these new estimators of $\\tau^2$ and, for\ncomparative purposes, bias and coverage of a number of well-known estimators\nbased on the $Q$ statistic with inverse-variance weights, $Q_{IV}$, such as the\nMandel-Paule, DerSimonian-Laird, and restricted-maximum-likelihood estimators,\nand an estimator based on the Kulinskaya-Dollinger (2015) improved\napproximation to $Q_{IV}$.",

      "abstract": "Robotic applications are continuously striving towards higher levels of\nautonomy. To achieve that goal, a highly robust and accurate state estimation\nis indispensable. Combining visual and inertial sensor modalities has proven to\nyield accurate and locally consistent results in short-term applications.\nUnfortunately, visual-inertial state estimators suffer from the accumulation of\ndrift for long-term trajectories. To eliminate this drift, global measurements\ncan be fused into the state estimation pipeline. The most known and widely\navailable source of global measurements is the Global Positioning System (GPS).\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach that fully combines stereo\nVisual-Inertial Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), including visual\nloop closures, with the fusion of global sensor modalities in a tightly-coupled\nand optimisation-based framework. Incorporating measurement uncertainties, we\nprovide a robust criterion to solve the global reference frame initialisation\nproblem. Furthermore, we propose a loop-closure-like optimisation scheme to\ncompensate drift accumulated during outages in receiving GPS signals.\nExperimental validation on datasets and in a real-world experiment demonstrates\nthe robustness of our approach to GPS dropouts as well as its capability to\nestimate highly accurate and globally consistent trajectories compared to\nexisting state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the de facto standard in a\ndiverse set of computer vision tasks for many years. Especially, deep neural\nnetworks based on seminal architectures such as U-shaped models with\nskip-connections or atrous convolution with pyramid pooling have been tailored\nto a wide range of medical image analysis tasks. The main advantage of such\narchitectures is that they are prone to detaining versatile local features.\nHowever, as a general consensus, CNNs fail to capture long-range dependencies\nand spatial correlations due to the intrinsic property of confined receptive\nfield size of convolution operations. Alternatively, Transformer, profiting\nfrom global information modelling that stems from the self-attention mechanism,\nhas recently attained remarkable performance in natural language processing and\ncomputer vision. Nevertheless, previous studies prove that both local and\nglobal features are critical for a deep model in dense prediction, such as\nsegmenting complicated structures with disparate shapes and configurations. To\nthis end, this paper proposes TransDeepLab, a novel DeepLab-like pure\nTransformer for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we exploit\nhierarchical Swin-Transformer with shifted windows to extend the DeepLabv3 and\nmodel the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. A thorough search of\nthe relevant literature yielded that we are the first to model the seminal\nDeepLab model with a pure Transformer-based model. Extensive experiments on\nvarious medical image segmentation tasks verify that our approach performs\nsuperior or on par with most contemporary works on an amalgamation of Vision\nTransformer and CNN-based methods, along with a significant reduction of model\ncomplexity.

The\nstrain mechanism and its effect on the microscopic electronic states leading to\nthe normal and superconducting state, however, remain undisclosed. Here, we\ninvestigate highly-strained epitaxial (110) RuO$_2$ films using\npolarization-dependent oxygen K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).\nThrough the detection of pre-edge peaks, arising from O:$2p$ - Ru:$4d$\nhybridization, we uncover the effects of epitaxial strain on the\norbital/electronic structure near the Fermi level. Our data show robust\nstrain-induced shifts of orbital levels and a reduction of hybridization\nstrength. Furthermore, we reveal a pronounced in-plane anisotropy of the\nelectronic structure along the $[110]/[1\\bar{1}0]$ directions naturally\nstemming from the symmetry-breaking epitaxial strain of the substrate. The\n$B_{2g}$ symmetry component of the epitaxially-enforced strain breaks a\nsublattice degeneracy, resulting in an increase of the density of states at the\nFermi level ($E_F$), possibly paving the way to superconductivity. These\nresults underscore the importance of the effective reduction from tetragonal to\northorhombic lattice symmetry in (110) RuO$_2$ films and its relevance towards\nthe superconducting and magnetic properties.",

The motion has been considered as a classical\noscillator in analyzing the influence. Here we treat the motion of the atom as\na quantum oscillator. The population on the vibrational states of the atom are\nconsidered in analyzing the gate fidelity and decoherence. We show that the\nfidelity of a coherent rotation gate is dramatically limited by the temperature\nof a thermally trapped atom. We also show that the dephasing between the two\nhyperfine states due to the thermal motion of the atom could rephase naturally\nif the differential frequency shift is stable and the vibrational states do not\nchange. The decoherence due to the fluctuations of the trap laser intensity is\nalso discussed. Both the gate fidelity and coherence time can be dramatically\nenhanced by cooling the atom into vibrational ground states and/or by using a\nblue-detuned trap. More importantly, we propose a \"magic\" trapping condition by\npreparing the atom into specific vibrational states.",

While most stateful\nlogic circuits to date focused on technologies such as resistive RAM, we\npropose two approaches to designing stateful logic using spin orbit torque\n(SOT) MRAM. The first approach utilizes the separation of read and write paths\nin SOT devices to perform logic operations. In contrast to previous work, our\nmethod utilizes a standard memory structure, and each row can be used as input\nor output. The second approach uses voltage-gated SOT switching to allow\nstateful logic in denser memory arrays.

Finally, a linearized\nCrank-Nicolson finite difference system is solved on the fine grid. Moreover,\nthe algorithm uses a central difference approximation for the spatial\nderivatives. In the time direction, the time derivative and integral term are\napproximated by Crank-Nicolson technique and product integral rule,\nrespectively. With the help of the discrete energy method, the stability and\nspace-time second-order convergence of the proposed approach are obtained in\n$L^2$-norm.

      "abstract": "Multi-instance point cloud registration is the problem of estimating multiple\nposes of source point cloud instances within a target point cloud. Solving this\nproblem is challenging since inlier correspondences of one instance constitute\noutliers of all the other instances. Existing methods often rely on\ntime-consuming hypothesis sampling or features leveraging spatial consistency,\nresulting in limited performance. In this paper, we propose PointCLM, a\ncontrastive learning-based framework for mutli-instance point cloud\nregistration. We first utilize contrastive learning to learn well-distributed\ndeep representations for the input putative correspondences. Then based on\nthese representations, we propose a outlier pruning strategy and a clustering\nstrategy to efficiently remove outliers and assign the remaining\ncorrespondences to correct instances. Our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real datasets by a large margin.",

      "abstract": "In view of immense interest to understand impact of an electron on atoms in\nthe low-energy scattering phenomena observed in laboratories and astrophysical\nprocesses, we prescribe here an approach to construct potentials using\nrelativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory for the determination of\nelectron-atom (e-A) elastic scattering cross-sections (eSCs). The net potential\nof an electron, scattered elastically by an atom, is conveniently expressed as\nsum of static ($V_{st}$) and exchange ($V_{ex}$) potentials due to interactions\nof the scattered electron with the electrons of the atom and potentials due to\npolarization effects ($V_{pol}$) on the scattered electron by the atomic\nelectrons. The $V_{st}$ and $V_{ex}$ potentials for the e-A eSC problems can be\nconstructed with the knowledge of electron density function of the atom, while\nthe $V_{pol}$ potential can be obtained using polarizabilities of the atom. In\nthis work, we present electron densities and electric polarizabilties of Be,\nMg, Ne and Ar atoms using two variants of the RCC method. Using these\nquantities, we construct potentials for the e-A eSC problems. For obtaining\n$V_{pol}$ accurately, we have evaluated the second- and third-order electric\ndipole and quadrupole polarizabilities in the linear response approach.",

The polarization measurement capability\nof CZTI for on-axis sources was experimentally confirmed before the launch.\nCZTI has yielded tantalizing results on the X-ray polarization of the Crab\nnebula and pulsar in the energy range of 100 - 380 keV. CZTI has also\ncontributed to the measurement of prompt emission polarization for several\nGamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). However, polarization measurements of off-axis sources\nlike GRBs are challenging. It is vital to experimentally calibrate the CZTI\nsensitivity to off-axis sources to enhance the credence of the measurements. In\nthis context, we report the verification of the off-axis polarimetric\ncapability of pixellated CZT detectors through the controlled experiments\ncarried out with a CZT detector similar to that used in CZTI and extensive\nGeant4 simulations of the experimental set-up. Our current results show that\nthe CZT detectors can be used to measure the polarization of bright GRBs up to\noff-axis angles of ~60 degrees.

      "abstract": "Recently, the sparse vector code (SVC) is emerging as a promising solution\nfor short-packet transmission in massive machine type communication (mMTC) as\nwell as ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). In the SVC\nprocess, the encoding and decoding stages are jointly modeled as a standard\ncompressed sensing (CS) problem. Hence, this paper aims at improving the\ndecoding performance of SVC by optimizing the spreading matrix (i.e.\nmeasurement matrix in CS). To this end, two greedy algorithms to minimize the\nmutual coherence value of the spreading matrix in SVC are proposed. Specially,\nfor practical applications, the spreading matrices are further required to be\nbipolar whose entries are constrained as +1 or -1. As a result, the optimized\nspreading matrices are highly efficient for storage, computation, and hardware\nrealization. Simulation results reveal that, compared with the existing work,\nthe block error rate (BLER) performance of SVC can be improved significantly\nwith the optimized spreading matrices.",

      "abstract": "Human motion transfer refers to synthesizing photo-realistic and temporally\ncoherent videos that enable one person to imitate the motion of others.\nHowever, current synthetic videos suffer from the temporal inconsistency in\nsequential frames that significantly degrades the video quality, yet is far\nfrom solved by existing methods in the pixel domain. Recently, some works on\nDeepFake detection try to distinguish the natural and synthetic images in the\nfrequency domain because of the frequency insufficiency of image synthesizing\nmethods. Nonetheless, there is no work to study the temporal inconsistency of\nsynthetic videos from the aspects of the frequency-domain gap between natural\nand synthetic videos. In this paper, we propose to delve into the frequency\nspace for temporally consistent human motion transfer. First of all, we make\nthe first comprehensive analysis of natural and synthetic videos in the\nfrequency domain to reveal the frequency gap in both the spatial dimension of\nindividual frames and the temporal dimension of the video. To close the\nfrequency gap between the natural and synthetic videos, we propose a novel\nFrequency-based human MOtion TRansfer framework, named FreMOTR, which can\neffectively mitigate the spatial artifacts and the temporal inconsistency of\nthe synthesized videos. FreMOTR explores two novel frequency-based\nregularization modules: 1) the Frequency-domain Appearance Regularization (FAR)\nto improve the appearance of the person in individual frames and 2) Temporal\nFrequency Regularization (TFR) to guarantee the temporal consistency between\nadjacent frames. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the\nFreMOTR not only yields superior performance in temporal consistency metrics\nbut also improves the frame-level visual quality of synthetic videos. In\nparticular, the temporal consistency metrics are improved by nearly 30% than\nthe state-of-the-art model.",

      "abstract": "Let $u(t,x)$ be the solution to the Cauchy problem of a scalar conservation\nlaw in one space dimension. It is well known that even for smooth initial data\nthe solution can become discontinuous in finite time and global entropy weak\nsolution can best lie in the space of bounded total variations. It is\nimpossible that the solutions belong to ,for example ,$H^1$ because by Sobolev\nembedding theorem $H^1$ functions are H$\\mathrm{\\ddot{o}}$lder continuous.\nHowever, we note that from any point $(t,x)$ we can draw a generalized\ncharacteristic downward which meets the initial axis at $y=\\alpha (t,x)$. if we\nregard $u$ as a function of $(t,y)$, it indeed belongs to $H^1$ as a function\nof $y$ if the initial data belongs to $H^1$. We may call this generalized\npersistence (of high regularity) of the entropy weak solutions. The main\npurpose of this paper is to prove some kinds of generalized persistence (of\nhigh regularity) for the scalar and $2\\times 2$ Temple system of hyperbolic\nconservation laws in one space dimension .",

      "abstract": "Continual relation extraction (CRE) requires the model to continually learn\nnew relations from class-incremental data streams. In this paper, we propose a\nFrustratingly easy but Effective Approach (FEA) method with two learning stages\nfor CRE: 1) Fast Adaption (FA) warms up the model with only new data. 2)\nBalanced Tuning (BT) finetunes the model on the balanced memory data. Despite\nits simplicity, FEA achieves comparable (on TACRED or superior (on FewRel)\nperformance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. With careful\nexaminations, we find that the data imbalance between new and old relations\nleads to a skewed decision boundary in the head classifiers over the pretrained\nencoders, thus hurting the overall performance. In FEA, the FA stage unleashes\nthe potential of memory data for the subsequent finetuning, while the BT stage\nhelps establish a more balanced decision boundary. With a unified view, we find\nthat two strong CRE baselines can be subsumed into the proposed training\npipeline. The success of FEA also provides actionable insights and suggestions\nfor future model designing in CRE.",

Then we\ndefine the extreme quantile treatment effect (EQTE) and the extreme average\ntreatment effect (EATE), which can be identified through the commonly adopted\nunconfoundedness condition and estimated with the aid of extreme value theory.\nOur limiting theory is for the EQTE and EATE processes indexed by a set of\nquantile levels and hence facilitates uniform inference.

      "abstract": "The recently released IEEE 802.15.6 standard specifies several physical (PHY)\nlayers and medium access control (MAC) layer protocols for variety of medical\nand non-medical applications of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). The medical\napplications of WBAN has several obligatory requirements and constrains viz.\nhigh reliability, strict delay deadlines and low power consumption. The\nstandard IEEE 802.15.6 MAC scheme is not able to fulfil the all requirements of\nmedical applications of WBAN. To address this issue we propose an IEEE\n802.15.6-based MAC scheme that is the modification of superframe structure,\nuser priorities and access mechanism of standard IEEE 802.15.6 MAC scheme. The\nproposed superframe has three access phases: random access phases (RAP), manage\naccess phases (MAP) and contention access phase (CAP). The proposed four user\npriorities nodes access the channel during RAP using CAMA/CA mechanism with a\nlarge value of contention window. The proposed MAC scheme uses RTS/CTS access\nmechanism instead of basic access mechanism to mitigate the effect of hidden\nand expose terminal problem. Moreover, we develop an analytical model to\nevaluate the performance of proposed MAC scheme and solve the analytical model\nusing Maple. The results show that the modified IEEE 802.15.6 MAC scheme\nachieve the better performance in terms of reliability, throughput, average\naccess delay, energy consumption, channel utilization and fairness compared to\nstandard IEEE 802.15.6 MAC scheme in E-health applications.",

      "title": "Attention Enhanced Citrinet for Speech Recognition",
      "abstract": "Citrinet is an end-to-end convolutional Connectionist Temporal Classification\n(CTC) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. To capture local and\nglobal contextual information, 1D time-channel separable convolutions combined\nwith sub-word encoding and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) are used in Citrinet,\nmaking the whole architecture to be as deep as including 23 blocks with 235\nconvolution layers and 46 linear layers. This pure convolutional and deep\narchitecture makes Critrinet relatively slow at convergence. In this paper, we\npropose to introduce multi-head attentions together with feed-forward networks\nin the convolution module in Citrinet blocks while keeping the SE module and\nresidual module unchanged. For speeding up, we remove 8 convolution layers in\neach attention-enhanced Citrinet block and reduce 23 blocks to 13. Experiments\non the Japanese CSJ-500h and Magic-1600h dataset show that the\nattention-enhanced Citrinet with less layers and blocks and converges faster\nwith lower character error rates than (1) Citrinet with 80\\% training time and\n(2) Conformer with 40\\% training time and 29.8\\% model size.",

      "abstract": "Cybersecurity has become a primary global concern with the rapid increase in\nsecurity attacks and data breaches. Artificial intelligence is promising to\nhelp humans analyzing and identifying attacks. However, labeling millions of\npackets for supervised learning is never easy. This study aims to leverage\ntransfer learning technique that stores the knowledge gained from well-defined\nattack lifecycle documents and applies it to hundred thousands of unlabeled\nattacks (packets) for identifying their attack tactics. We anticipate the\nknowledge of an attack is well-described in the documents, and the cutting edge\ntransformer-based language model can embed the knowledge into a\nhigh-dimensional latent space. Then, reusing the information from the language\nmodel for the learning of attack tactic carried by packets to improve the\nlearning efficiency. We propose a system, PELAT, that fine-tunes BERT model\nwith 1,417 articles from MITRE ATT&CK lifecycle framework to enhance its attack\nknowledge (including syntax used and semantic meanings embedded). PELAT then\ntransfers its knowledge to perform semi-supervised learning for unlabeled\npackets to generate their tactic labels. Further, when a new attack packet\narrives, the packet payload will be processed by the PELAT language model with\na downstream classifier to predict its tactics. In this way, we can effectively\nreduce the burden of manually labeling big datasets. In a one-week honeypot\nattack dataset (227 thousand packets per day), PELAT performs 99% of precision,\nrecall, and F1 on testing dataset. PELAT can infer over 99% of tactics on two\nother testing datasets (while nearly 90% of tactics are identified).",

      "abstract": "Privacy issues on social networks have been extensively discussed in recent\nyears. The user identity linkage (UIL) task, aiming at finding corresponding\nusers across different social networks, would be a threat to privacy if\nunethically applied. The sensitive user information might be detected through\nconnected identities. A promising and novel solution to this issue is to design\nan adversarial strategy to degrade the matching performance of UIL models.\nHowever, most existing adversarial attacks on graphs are designed for models\nworking in a single network, while UIL is a cross-network learning task.\nMeanwhile, privacy protection against UIL works unilaterally in real-world\nscenarios, i.e., the service provider can only add perturbations to its own\nnetwork to protect its users from being linked. To tackle these challenges,\nthis paper proposes a novel adversarial attack strategy that poisons one target\nnetwork to prevent its nodes from being linked to other networks by UIL\nalgorithms. Specifically, we reformalize the UIL problem in the perspective of\nkernelized topology consistency and convert the attack objective to maximizing\nthe structural changes within the target network before and after attacks. A\nnovel graph kernel is then defined with Earth mover's distance (EMD) on the\nedge-embedding space. In terms of efficiency, a fast attack strategy is\nproposed by greedy searching and replacing EMD with its lower bound. Results on\nthree real-world datasets indicate that the proposed attacks can best fool a\nwide range of UIL models and reach a balance between attack effectiveness and\nimperceptibility.",

      "abstract": "Most existing methods that cope with noisy labels usually assume that the\nclass distributions are well balanced, which has insufficient capacity to deal\nwith the practical scenarios where training samples have imbalanced\ndistributions. To this end, this paper makes an early effort to tackle the\nimage classification task with both long-tailed distribution and label noise.\nExisting noise-robust learning methods cannot work in this scenario as it is\nchallenging to differentiate noisy samples from clean samples of tail classes.\nTo deal with this problem, we propose a new learning paradigm based on matching\nbetween inferences on weak and strong data augmentations to screen out noisy\nsamples and introduce a leave-noise-out regularization to eliminate the effect\nof the recognized noisy samples. Furthermore, we incorporate a novel prediction\npenalty based on online prior distribution to avoid bias towards head classes.\nThis mechanism has superiority in capturing the class fitting degree in\nrealtime compared to the existing long-tail classification methods. Exhaustive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art\nalgorithms that address the distribution imbalance problem in long-tailed\nclassification under noisy labels.",

Recently, a pre-trained deep contextualized\ntext encoder such as BERT has shown its potential in improving natural language\ntasks including abstractive summarization. Existing approaches in dialogue\nsummarization focus on incorporating a large language model into summarization\ntask trained on large-scale corpora consisting of news articles rather than\ndialogues of multiple speakers. In this paper, we introduce self-supervised\nmethods to compensate shortcomings to train a dialogue summarization model. Our\nprinciple is to detect incoherent information flows using pretext dialogue text\nto enhance BERT's ability to contextualize the dialogue text representations.\nWe build and fine-tune an abstractive dialogue summarization model on a shared\nencoder-decoder architecture using the enhanced BERT. We empirically evaluate\nour abstractive dialogue summarizer with the SAMSum corpus, a recently\nintroduced dataset with abstractive dialogue summaries. All of our methods have\ncontributed improvements to abstractive summary measured in ROUGE scores.\nThrough an extensive ablation study, we also present a sensitivity analysis to\ncritical model hyperparameters, probabilities of switching utterances and\nmasking interlocutors.",

      "abstract": "Spatial scan statistics are well known and widely used methods for the\ndetection of spatial clusters of events. In the field of spatial analysis of\ntime-to-event data, several models of scan statistics have been proposed.\nHowever, these models do not take into account the potential intra-unit spatial\ncorrelation of individuals nor a potential correlation between spatial units.\nTo overcome this problem, we propose here a scan statistic based on a Cox model\nwith shared frailty that takes into account the spatial correlation between\nspatial units. In simulation studies, we have shown that (i) classical models\nof spatial scan statistics for time-to-event data fail to maintain the type I\nerror in the presence of intra-spatial unit correlation, and (ii) our model\nperforms well in the presence of both intra-spatial unit correlation and\ninter-spatial unit correlation. Our method has been applied to epidemiological\ndata and to the detection of spatial clusters of mortality in patients with\nend-stage renal disease in northern France.",

      "abstract": "Semantic communication (SC) goes beyond technical communication in which a\ngiven sequence of bits or symbols, often referred to as information, is be\ntransmitted reliably over a noisy channel, regardless of its meaning. In SC,\nconveying the meaning of information becomes important, which requires some\nsort of agreement between a sender and a receiver through their knowledge\nbases. In this sense, SC is closely related to a signaling game where a sender\ntakes an action to send a signal that conveys information to a receiver, while\nthe receiver can interpret the signal and choose a response accordingly. Based\non the signaling game, we can build a SC model and characterize the performance\nin terms of mutual information in this paper. In addition, we show that the\nconditional mutual information between the instances of the knowledge bases of\ncommunicating parties plays a crucial role in improving the performance of SC.",

The\n0.5-10 keV XIS count rate varied between $\\sim$ 1 and $\\sim$ 5 counts s$^{-1}$\nduring the observations. A partial X-ray eclipse and broad post-eclipse\nintensity dip were observed during the observations. The X-ray emission\nhardened marginally during the intensity dip. We have modelled the source\nspectra by simultaneously fitting the XIS and HXD-PIN spectra for each of the\nfour observations. The broad-band spectra of the source can be described by a\nmodel comprising a very hot blackbody having temperature, $kT_{\\rm BB} \\approx$\n1.66 - 2.13 keV, a high-energy cutoff power law, and an Fe emission line at\n$E_{\\rm line} \\sim$ 6.7 keV.

      "abstract": "We study environmental quenching using the spatial distribution of current\nstar-formation and stellar population ages with the full SAMI Galaxy Survey. By\nusing a star-formation concentration index [C-index, defined as\nlog10(r_{50,Halpha}/r_{50,cont})], we separate our sample into regular galaxies\n(C-index>-0.2) and galaxies with centrally concentrated star-formation\n(SF-concentrated; C-index<-0.2). Concentrated star-formation is a potential\nindicator of galaxies currently undergoing `outside-in' quenching. Our\nenvironments cover ungrouped galaxies, low-mass groups (M_200<10^12.5 M_sun),\nhigh-mass groups (M_200 in the range 10^{12.5-14} M_sun) and clusters\n(M_200>10^14 M_sun). We find the fraction of SF-concentrated galaxies increases\nas halo mass increases with 9\\pm2 per cent, 8\\pm3 per cent, 19\\pm4 per cent and\n29\\pm4 per cent for ungrouped galaxies, low-mass groups, high-mass groups and\nclusters, respectively. We interpret these results as evidence for `outside-in'\nquenching in groups and clusters. To investigate the quenching time-scale in\nSF-concentrated galaxies, we calculate light-weighted age (Age_L) and\nmass-weighted age (Age_M) using full spectral fitting, as well as the Dn4000\nand Hdelta_A indices. We assume that the average galaxy age radial profile\nbefore entering a group or cluster is similar to ungrouped regular galaxies. At\nlarge radius (1-2 R_e), SF-concentrated galaxies in high-mass groups have older\nages than ungrouped regular galaxies with an age difference of 1.83\\pm0.38 Gyr\nfor Age_L and 1.34\\pm0.56 Gyr for Age_M. This suggests that while `outside-in'\nquenching can be effective in groups, the process will not quickly quench the\nentire galaxy. In contrast, the ages at 1-2 R_e of cluster SF-concentrated\ngalaxies and ungrouped regular galaxies are consistent (0.19\\pm0.21 Gyr for\nAge_L, 0.40\\pm0.61 Gyr for Age_M), suggesting the quenching process must be\nrapid.",

      "abstract": "Creating a complex work of art like music necessitates profound creativity.\nWith recent advancements in deep learning and powerful models such as\ntransformers, there has been huge progress in automatic music generation. In an\naccompaniment generation context, creating a coherent drum pattern with\napposite fills and improvisations at proper locations in a song is a\nchallenging task even for an experienced drummer. Drum beats tend to follow a\nrepetitive pattern through stanzas with fills or improvisation at section\nboundaries. In this work, we tackle the task of drum pattern generation\nconditioned on the accompanying music played by four melodic instruments:\nPiano, Guitar, Bass, and Strings. We use the transformer sequence to sequence\nmodel to generate a basic drum pattern conditioned on the melodic accompaniment\nto find that improvisation is largely absent, attributed possibly to its\nexpectedly relatively low representation in the training data. We propose a\nnovelty function to capture the extent of improvisation in a bar relative to\nits neighbors. We train a model to predict improvisation locations from the\nmelodic accompaniment tracks. Finally, we use a novel BERT-inspired in-filling\narchitecture, to learn the structure of both the drums and melody to in-fill\nelements of improvised music.",

      "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has achieved great success in laser-based\ncollision avoidance works because the laser can sense accurate depth\ninformation without too much redundant data, which can maintain the robustness\nof the algorithm when it is migrated from the simulation environment to the\nreal world. However, high-cost laser devices are not only difficult to deploy\nfor a large scale of robots but also demonstrate unsatisfactory robustness\ntowards the complex obstacles, including irregular obstacles, e.g., tables,\nchairs, and shelves, as well as complex ground and special materials. In this\npaper, we propose a novel monocular camera-based complex obstacle avoidance\nframework. Particularly, we innovatively transform the captured RGB images to\npseudo-laser measurements for efficient deep reinforcement learning. Compared\nto the traditional laser measurement captured at a certain height that only\ncontains one-dimensional distance information away from the neighboring\nobstacles, our proposed pseudo-laser measurement fuses the depth and semantic\ninformation of the captured RGB image, which makes our method effective for\ncomplex obstacles. We also design a feature extraction guidance module to\nweight the input pseudo-laser measurement, and the agent has more reasonable\nattention for the current state, which is conducive to improving the accuracy\nand efficiency of the obstacle avoidance policy.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we propose a framework for energy-efficient trajectory design\nof an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based portable access point (PAP) deployed\nto serve a set of ground nodes (GNs). In addition to the PAP and GNs, the\nsystem consists of a set of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) mounted on\nman-made structures to increase the number of bits transmitted per Joule of\nenergy consumed measured as the global energy efficiency (GEE). The GEE\ntrajectory for the PAP is designed by considering the UAV propulsion energy\nconsumption and the Peukert effect of the PAP battery, which represents an\naccurate battery discharge profile as a non-linear function of the UAV power\nconsumption profile. The GEE trajectory design problem is solved in two phases:\nin the first, a path for the PAP and feasible positions for the IRS modules are\nfound using a multi-tier circle packing method, and the required IRS phase\nshift values are calculated using an alternate optimization method that\nconsiders the interdependence between the amplitude and phase responses of an\nIRS element; in the second phase, the PAP flying velocity and user scheduling\nare calculated using a novel multilap trajectory design algorithm. Numerical\nevaluations show that: neglecting the Peukert effect overestimates the\navailable flight time of the PAP; after a certain threshold, increasing the\nbattery size reduces the available flight time of the PAP; the presence of IRS\nmodules improves the GEE of the system compared to other baseline scenarios;\nthe multi-lap trajectory saves more energy compared to a single-lap trajectory\ndeveloped using a combination of sequential convex programming and Dinkelbach\nalgorithm.",

This is\naccomplished by introducing a model for the magnetic field dependence of the\nattractive interaction between superconducting electrons. This model states\nthat the surface potential well produced by the penetrating magnetic field\nleads to the magnetic field dependence of the attractive interaction.\nSpecifically, the electron density near the surface increases with the magnetic\nfield due to the surface potential well, which causes the reduction in the\nattractive interaction due to the screening effect. We also develop the\ncalculation scheme to solve the gap equation of the sc-CDFT with taking into\naccount the magnetic field dependence of the attractive interaction.

      "abstract": "We report on interaction of the legs of the erupting filament of 2012 August\n31 and associated prominent supra-arcade downflows (P-SADs) as observed by the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We employ\na number of image processing techniques to enhance weak interacting features.\nAs the filament erupts, both legs stretch outwards. The positive-polarity leg\nalso untwists and splits into two parts. The first part runs into the conjugate\n(negative-polarity) leg, tearing it apart. The second part then converges into\nthe remnant of the conjugate leg, after which both weaken and finally\ndisappear. All these episodes of interaction of oppositely-oriented filament\nlegs are followed by appearance of P-SADs, seen in the on-disk projection to be\nshaped as loop-tops, along with many weaker SADs. All SADs are preceded by hot\nsupra-arcade downflowing loops. This observed evolution is consistent with the\nthree-dimensional rr-rf (leg-leg) reconnection, where the erupting flux rope\nreconnects with itself. In our observations, as well as in some models, the\nreconnection in this geometry is found to be long-lasting. It plays a\nsubstantial role in the evolution of the flux rope of the erupting filament and\nleads to prominent supra-arcade downflows.",

      "abstract": "We report the detection of FRB20191107B with the UTMOST radio telescope at a\ndispersion measure (DM) of 714.9 ${\\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$. The burst consists of\nthree components, the brightest of which has an intrinsic width of only 11.3\n$\\mu$s and a scattering tail with an exponentially decaying time-scale of 21.4\n$\\mu$s measured at 835 MHz. We model the sensitivity of UTMOST and other major\nFRB surveys to such narrow events. We find that $>60\\%$ of FRBs like\nFRB20191107B are being missed, and that a significant population of very narrow\nFRBs probably exists and remains underrepresented in these surveys. The high DM\nand small scattering timescale of FRB20191107B allows us to place an upper\nlimit on the strength of turbulence in the Intergalactic Medium (IGM),\nquantified as scattering measure (SM), of ${\\rm SM_{IGM} < 8.4 \\times 10^{-7}\n~kpc~m^{-20/3}}$. Almost all UTMOST FRBs have full phase information due to\nreal-time voltage capture which provides us with the largest sample of\ncoherently dedispersed single burst FRBs. Our 10.24 $\\mu$s time resolution data\nyields accurately measured FRB scattering timescales. We combine the UTMOST\nFRBs with 10 FRBs from the literature and find no obvious evidence for a\nDM-scattering relation, suggesting that IGM is not the dominant source of\nscattering in FRBs. We support the results of previous studies and identify the\nlocal environment of the source in the host galaxy as the most likely region\nwhich dominates the observed scattering of our FRBs.",

      "abstract": "Supervised machine learning provides state-of-the-art solutions to a wide\nrange of computer vision problems. However, the need for copious labelled\ntraining data limits the capabilities of these algorithms in scenarios where\nsuch input is scarce or expensive. Self-supervised learning offers a way to\nlower the need for manually annotated data by pretraining models for a specific\ndomain on unlabelled data. In this approach, labelled data are solely required\nto fine-tune models for downstream tasks. Medical image segmentation is a field\nwhere labelling data requires expert knowledge and collecting large labelled\ndatasets is challenging; therefore, self-supervised learning algorithms promise\nsubstantial improvements in this field. Despite this, self-supervised learning\nalgorithms are used rarely to pretrain medical image segmentation networks. In\nthis paper, we elaborate and analyse the effectiveness of supervised and\nself-supervised pretraining approaches on downstream medical image\nsegmentation, focusing on convergence and data efficiency. We find that\nself-supervised pretraining on natural images and target-domain-specific images\nleads to the fastest and most stable downstream convergence. In our experiments\non the ACDC cardiac segmentation dataset, this pretraining approach achieves\n4-5 times faster fine-tuning convergence compared to an ImageNet pretrained\nmodel. We also show that this approach requires less than five epochs of\npretraining on domain-specific data to achieve such improvement in the\ndownstream convergence time. Finally, we find that, in low-data scenarios,\nsupervised ImageNet pretraining achieves the best accuracy, requiring less than\n100 annotated samples to realise close to minimal error.",

We do so by devising several sufficient conditions\nfor the existence and non-existence of long cycles in power graphs of finite\ngroups. We examine other natural group classes, including special linear,\nsymmetric, generalized dihedral and quaternion groups, and we characterize\ndirect products with chordal power graph. The classification problem is thereby\nreduced to directly indecomposable groups and we further obtain a list of\npossible socles.

Krein's results on the\nuniqueness of positive (respectively, norm preserving) self-adjoint extensions\nare also revised.",

To\nunderstand the kind of biases writers are concerned about and how they mitigate\nthose in their writing, we conducted formative interviews with nine writers.\nThe interviews suggested that despite a writer's best interest, tracking and\nmanaging implicit biases such as a lack of agency, supporting or submissive\nroles, or harmful language for characters representing marginalized groups is\nchallenging as the story becomes longer and complicated. Based on the\ninterviews, we developed DramatVis Personae (DVP), a visual analytics tool that\nallows writers to assign social identities to characters, and evaluate how\ncharacters and different intersectional social identities are represented in\nthe story. To evaluate DVP, we first conducted think-aloud sessions with three\nwriters and found that DVP is easy-to-use, naturally integrates into the\nwriting process, and could potentially help writers in several critical bias\nidentification tasks. We then conducted a follow-up user study with 11 writers\nand found that participants could answer questions related to bias detection\nmore efficiently using DVP in comparison to a simple text editor.",

      "abstract": "Spin-to-charge conversion is an essential requirement for the implementation\nof spintronic devices. Recently, monolayers of semiconducting transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable interest for spin-to-charge\nconversion due to their high spin-orbit coupling and lack of inversion symmetry\nin their crystal structure. However, reports of direct measurement of\nspin-to-charge conversion at TMD-based interfaces are very much limited. Here,\nwe report on the room temperature observation of a large spin-to-charge\nconversion arising from the interface of Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) and four\ndistinct large area ($\\sim 5\\times2$~mm$^2$) monolayer (ML) TMDs namely,\nMoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$. We show that both spin mixing\nconductance and the Rashba efficiency parameter ($\\lambda_{IREE}$) scales with\nthe spin-orbit coupling strength of the ML TMD layers. The $\\lambda_{IREE}$\nparameter is found to range between $-0.54$ and $-0.76$ nm for the four\nmonolayer TMDs, demonstrating a large spin-to-charge conversion. Our findings\nreveal that TMD/ferromagnet interface can be used for efficient generation and\ndetection of spin current, opening new opportunities for novel spintronic\ndevices.",

A constant gradient of extensile\n(contractile) activity endows the comet-like $+1/2$ defect with a finite\nvorticity that drives the defect to align its nose in the direction of\ndecreasing (increasing) gradient. A constant gradient does not, however, affect\nthe known self-propulsion of the $+1/2$ defect and has no effect on the $-1/2$\nthat remains a non-motile particle. A sharp jump in activity acts like a wall\nthat traps the defects, affecting the translational and rotational motion of\nboth charges. The $+1/2$ defect slows down as it approaches the interface and\nthe net vorticity tends to reorient the defect polarization so that it becomes\nperpendicular to the interface. The $-1/2$ defect acquires a self-propulsion\ntowards the activity interface, while the vorticity-induced active torque tends\nto align the defect to a preferred orientation. This effective attraction of\nthe negative defects to the wall is consistent with the observation of an\naccumulation of negative topological charge at both active/passive interfaces\nand physical boundaries.",

      "abstract": "Inspired by human behavior when traveling over unknown terrain, this study\nproposes the use of probing strategies and integrates them into a\ntraversability analysis framework to address safe navigation on unknown rough\nterrain. Our framework integrates collapsibility information into our existing\ntraversability analysis, as vision and geometric information alone could be\nmisled by unpredictable non-rigid terrains such as soft soil, bush area, or\nwater puddles. With the new traversability analysis framework, our robot has a\nmore comprehensive assessment of unpredictable terrain, which is critical for\nits safety in outdoor environments. The pipeline first identifies the terrain's\ngeometric and semantic properties using an RGB-D camera and desired probing\nlocations on questionable terrains. These regions are probed using a force\nsensor to determine the risk of terrain collapsing when the robot steps over\nit. This risk is formulated as a collapsibility metric, which estimates an\nunpredictable region's ground collapsibility. Thereafter, the collapsibility\nmetric, together with geometric and semantic spatial data, is combined and\nanalyzed to produce global and local traversability grid maps. These\ntraversability grid maps tell the robot whether it is safe to step over\ndifferent regions of the map. The grid maps are then utilized to generate\noptimal paths for the robot to safely navigate to its goal. Our approach has\nbeen successfully verified on a quadrupedal robot in both simulation and\nreal-world experiments.",

      "abstract": "We propose a novel numerical method for the solution of the shallow water\nequations in different regimes of the Froude number making use of general\npolygonal meshes. The fluxes of the governing equations are split such that\nadvection and acoustic-gravity sub-systems are derived, hence separating slow\nand fast phenomena. This splitting allows the nonlinear convective fluxes to be\ndiscretized explicitly in time, while retaining an implicit time marching for\nthe acoustic-gravity terms. Consequently, the novel schemes are particularly\nwell suited in the low Froude limit of the model, since no numerical viscosity\nis added in the implicit solver. Besides, stability follows from a milder CFL\ncondition which is based only on the advection speed and not on the celerity.\nHigh order time accuracy is achieved using the family of semi-implicit IMEX\nRunge-Kutta schemes, while high order in space is granted relying on two\ndiscretizations: (i) a cell-centered finite volume (FV) scheme for the\nnonlinear convective contribution on the polygonal cells; (ii) a staggered\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for the solution of the linear system\nassociated to the implicit discretization of the pressure sub-system.\nTherefore, three different meshes are used, namely a polygonal Voronoi mesh, a\ntriangular subgrid and a staggered quadrilateral subgrid. The novel schemes are\nproved to be Asymptotic Preserving (AP), hence a consistent discretization of\nthe limit model is retrieved for vanishing Froude numbers, which is the given\nby the so-called \"lake at rest\" equations. Furthermore, the novel methods are\nwell-balanced by construction, and this property is also demonstrated. Accuracy\nand robustness are then validated against a set of benchmark test cases with\nFroude numbers ranging in the interval $\\Fr \\approx [10^{-6};5]$, hence showing\nthat multiple time scales can be handled by the novel methods.",

      "abstract": "By performing dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the\nmicrorheology of isotropic suspensions of hard-core colloidal cuboids. In\nparticular, we infer the local viscoelastic behaviour of these fluids by\nstudying the dynamics of a probe spherical particle that is incorporated in the\nhost phase and is dragged by an external force. This technique, known as active\nmicrorheology, allows one to characterise the microscopic response of soft\nmaterials upon application of a constant force, whose intensity spans here\nthree orders of magnitude. By tuning the geometry of cuboids from oblate to\nprolate as well as the system density, we observe different responses that are\nquantified by measuring the effective friction perceived by the probe particle.\nThe resulting friction coefficient exhibits a linear regime at forces that are\nmuch weaker and larger than the thermal forces, whereas a non-linear,\nforce-thinning regime is observed at intermediate force intensities.",

      "abstract": "Automatic extraction of funding information from academic articles adds\nsignificant value to industry and research communities, such as tracking\nresearch outcomes by funding organizations, profiling researchers and\nuniversities based on the received funding, and supporting open access\npolicies. Two major challenges of identifying and linking funding entities are:\n(i) sparse graph structure of the Knowledge Base (KB), which makes the commonly\nused graph-based entity linking approaches suboptimal for the funding domain,\n(ii) missing entities in KB, which (unlike recent zero-shot approaches)\nrequires marking entity mentions without KB entries as NIL. We propose an\nentity linking model that can perform NIL prediction and overcome data scarcity\nissues in a time and data-efficient manner. Our model builds on a\ntransformer-based mention detection and bi-encoder model to perform entity\nlinking. We show that our model outperforms strong existing baselines.",

      "abstract": "We propose AccoMontage2, a system capable of doing full-length song\nharmonization and accompaniment arrangement based on a lead melody. Following\nAccoMontage, this study focuses on generating piano arrangements for\npopular/folk songs and it carries on the generalized template-based retrieval\nmethod. The novelties of this study are twofold. First, we invent a\nharmonization module (which AccoMontage does not have). This module generates\nstructured and coherent full-length chord progression by optimizing and\nbalancing three loss terms: a micro-level loss for note-wise dissonance, a\nmeso-level loss for phrase-template matching, and a macro-level loss for full\npiece coherency. Second, we develop a graphical user interface which allows\nusers to select different styles of chord progression and piano texture.\nCurrently, chord progression styles include Pop, R&B, and Dark, while piano\ntexture styles include several levels of voicing density and rhythmic\ncomplexity. Experimental results show that both our harmonization and\narrangement results significantly outperform the baselines. Lastly, we release\nAccoMontage2 as an online application as well as the organized chord\nprogression templates as a public dataset.",

      "title": "Gait Recognition in the Wild with Multi-hop Temporal Switch",
      "abstract": "Existing studies for gait recognition are dominated by in-the-lab scenarios.\nSince people live in real-world senses, gait recognition in the wild is a more\npractical problem that has recently attracted the attention of the community of\nmultimedia and computer vision. Current methods that obtain state-of-the-art\nperformance on in-the-lab benchmarks achieve much worse accuracy on the\nrecently proposed in-the-wild datasets because these methods can hardly model\nthe varied temporal dynamics of gait sequences in unconstrained scenes.\nTherefore, this paper presents a novel multi-hop temporal switch method to\nachieve effective temporal modeling of gait patterns in real-world scenes.\nConcretely, we design a novel gait recognition network, named Multi-hop\nTemporal Switch Network (MTSGait), to learn spatial features and multi-scale\ntemporal features simultaneously. Different from existing methods that use 3D\nconvolutions for temporal modeling, our MTSGait models the temporal dynamics of\ngait sequences by 2D convolutions. By this means, it achieves high efficiency\nwith fewer model parameters and reduces the difficulty in optimization compared\nwith 3D convolution-based models. Based on the specific design of the 2D\nconvolution kernels, our method can eliminate the misalignment of features\namong adjacent frames. In addition, a new sampling strategy, i.e., non-cyclic\ncontinuous sampling, is proposed to make the model learn more robust temporal\nfeatures. Finally, the proposed method achieves superior performance on two\npublic gait in-the-wild datasets, i.e., GREW and Gait3D, compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Emulsions are common in many natural and industrial settings. Recently, much\nattention has been put on understanding the dynamics of turbulent emulsions.\nThis paper reviews some recent studies of emulsions in turbulent Taylor-Couette\nflow, mainly focusing on the statistics of the dispersed phase and the global\nmomentum transport of the system. We first study the size distribution and the\nbreakup mechanism of the dispersed droplets for turbulent emulsions with a low\nvolume-fraction (dilute) of the dispersed phase. For systems with a high\nvolume-fraction of the dispersed phase (dense), we address the detailed\nresponse of the global transport (effective viscosity) of the turbulent\nemulsion and its connection to the droplet statistics. Finally, we will discuss\ncatastrophic phase inversions, which can happen when the volume fraction of the\ndispersed phase exceeds a critical value during dynamic emulsification. We end\nthe manuscript with a summary and an outlook including some open questions for\nfuture research.

We use new\nALMA observations of the CO(2-1) line with a spatial resolution of about 80 pc\ntogether with ancillary HST imaging. We reach the following results: (1) The CO\nkinematics are well described by a regularly rotating gas disk with a radial\ninflow motion, suggesting weak feedback on the cold gas from both AGN and\nstarburst activity; (2) The dynamically inferred SMBH mass is 1.6 +/- 0.4 (rnd)\n+/- 0.8 (sys) x 10^8 Msun, assuming that we have accurately subtracted the AGN\nand starburst light contributions, which have a luminosity of about 10^9 Lsun;\n(3) The SMBH mass agrees with the SMBH-stellar mass relation but is about 50\ntimes higher than previous estimates from X-ray variability; (4) The\ndynamically inferred molecular gas mass is 30 times smaller than that inferred\nfrom adopting the Galactic CO-to-H_2 conversion factor (X_CO) for thermalised\ngas, suggesting low values of X_CO; (5) the molecular gas inflow rate increases\nsteadily with radius and may be as high as 5 Msun/yr.

To avoid each node transmitting the entire local\nHessian approximation, we design a compression procedure with error\ncompensation to estimate the global Hessian in a communication-efficient way.\nWith novel analysis, we establish the globally linear (resp., asymptotically\nsuper-linear) convergence rate of the proposed method when m is constant\n(resp., tends to infinity), where m is the number of consensus inner steps. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first super-linear convergence result\nfor a communication-efficient decentralized Newton's method. Moreover, the rate\nwe establish is provably faster than those of first-order methods. Our\nnumerical results on various applications corroborate the theoretical findings.",

Here we address an exotic parity behavior\nof the QRM in its superradiant phase by numerical exact diagonalization,\nnamely, the parities of eigenstates of the QRM behave irregular in the strong\ncoupling regime but the sum of parities for each pair of eigenstates beginning\nfrom the ground state remains vanishing. It is found that this exotic behavior\noriginates from the comparability of the photon distribution in the odd and\neven components of Fock basis when the eigenenergies of each pair of\neigenstates approach enough to each other and physically is due to the emergent\ndouble-well potential induced by the strong coupling between the single-mode\nphoton field and the two-level atom. The result not only uncovers the physics\nnot known previously in the QRM but also makes an intrinsic limitation on the\nmeasurement precision of motional quantum states through parity measurements in\nmodern quantum science and technologies.",

Existing\ncontrol methods include conventional methods that provide a formula to\ncalculate the control time and reinforcement learning (RL) methods that\ndetermine the control policy through repeated interactions with the system. In\nthis paper, we propose an integrated proximal policy optimization model with\ndual-headway (IPPO-DH). IPPO-DH integrates the conventional headway control\nwith reinforcement learning, so that it acquires the advantages of both\nalgorithms -- it is more efficient in normal environments and more stable in\nharsh ones. To demonstrate such an advantage, we design a bus simulation\nenvironment and compare IPPO-DH with RL and several conventional methods. The\nresults show that the proposed model maintains the application value of the\nconventional method by avoiding the instability of the RL method in certain\nenvironments, and improves the efficiency compared with the conventional\ncontrol, shedding new light on real-world bus transit system optimization.",

      "title": "Diagnostic Quality Assessment for Low-Dimensional ECG Representations",
      "abstract": "There have been several attempts to quantify the diagnostic distortion caused\nby algorithms that perform low-dimensional electrocardiogram (ECG)\nrepresentation. However, there is no universally accepted quantitative measure\nthat allows the diagnostic distortion arising from denoising, compression, and\nECG beat representation algorithms to be determined. Hence, the main objective\nof this work was to develop a framework to enable biomedical engineers to\nefficiently and reliably assess diagnostic distortion resulting from ECG\nprocessing algorithms. We propose a semiautomatic framework for quantifying the\ndiagnostic resemblance between original and denoised/reconstructed ECGs.\nEvaluation of the ECG must be done manually, but is kept simple and does not\nrequire medical training. In a case study, we quantified the agreement between\nraw and reconstructed (denoised) ECG recordings by means of kappa-based\nstatistical tests. The proposed methodology takes into account that the\nobservers may agree by chance alone. Consequently, for the case study, our\nstatistical analysis reports the \"true\", beyond-chance agreement in contrast to\nother, less robust measures, such as simple percent agreement calculations. Our\nframework allows efficient assessment of clinically important diagnostic\ndistortion, a potential side effect of ECG (pre-)processing algorithms.\nAccurate quantification of a possible diagnostic loss is critical to any\nsubsequent ECG signal analysis, for instance, the detection of ischemic ST\nepisodes in long-term ECG recordings.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the task of unsupervised object discovery in\nvideos. Previous works have shown promising results via processing optical\nflows to segment objects. However, taking flow as input brings about two\ndrawbacks. First, flow cannot capture sufficient cues when objects remain\nstatic or partially occluded. Second, it is challenging to establish temporal\ncoherency from flow-only input, due to the missing texture information. To\ntackle these limitations, we propose a model for directly processing\nconsecutive RGB frames, and infer the optical flow between any pair of frames\nusing a layered representation, with the opacity channels being treated as the\nsegmentation. Additionally, to enforce object permanence, we apply temporal\nconsistency loss on the inferred masks from randomly-paired frames, which refer\nto the motions at different paces, and encourage the model to segment the\nobjects even if they may not move at the current time point. Experimentally, we\ndemonstrate superior performance over previous state-of-the-art methods on\nthree public video segmentation datasets (DAVIS2016, SegTrackv2, and FBMS-59),\nwhile being computationally efficient by avoiding the overhead of computing\noptical flow as input.",

      "abstract": "With increasing demands for high-quality semantic segmentation in the\nindustry, hard-distinguishing semantic boundaries have posed a significant\nthreat to existing solutions. Inspired by real-life experience, i.e., combining\nvaried observations contributes to higher visual recognition confidence, we\npresent the equipotential learning (EPL) method. This novel module transfers\nthe predicted/ground-truth semantic labels to a self-defined potential domain\nto learn and infer decision boundaries along customized directions. The\nconversion to the potential domain is implemented via a lightweight\ndifferentiable anisotropic convolution without incurring any parameter\noverhead. Besides, the designed two loss functions, the point loss and the\nequipotential line loss implement anisotropic field regression and\ncategory-level contour learning, respectively, enhancing prediction\nconsistencies in the inter/intra-class boundary areas. More importantly, EPL is\nagnostic to network architectures, and thus it can be plugged into most\nexisting segmentation models. This paper is the first attempt to address the\nboundary segmentation problem with field regression and contour learning.\nMeaningful performance improvements on Pascal Voc 2012 and Cityscapes\ndemonstrate that the proposed EPL module can benefit the off-the-shelf fully\nconvolutional network models when recognizing semantic boundary areas. Besides,\nintensive comparisons and analysis show the favorable merits of EPL for\ndistinguishing semantically-similar and irregular-shaped categories.",

In this paper, in order to improve the ability of\nextracting suffi-cient feature information in rectal tumour segmentation,\nattention enlarged ConvNeXt UNet (AACN-UNet), is proposed. The network mainly\nincludes two improvements: 1) the encoder stage of UNet is changed to ConvNeXt\nstructure for encoding operation, which can not only integrate multi-scale\nsemantic information on a large scale, but al-so reduce information loss and\nextract more feature information from CT images; 2) CBAM attention mechanism is\nadded to improve the connection of each feature in channel and space, which is\nconducive to extracting the effective feature of the target and improving the\nsegmentation accuracy.The experiment with UNet and its variant network shows\nthat AACN-UNet is 0.9% ,1.1% and 1.4% higher than the current best results in\nP, F1 and Miou.Compared with the training time, the number of parameters in\nUNet network is less.

      "abstract": "Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) faces challenges of memorizing\nold class distributions and estimating new class distributions given few\ntraining samples. In this study, we propose a learnable distribution\ncalibration (LDC) approach, with the aim to systematically solve these two\nchallenges using a unified framework. LDC is built upon a parameterized\ncalibration unit (PCU), which initializes biased distributions for all classes\nbased on classifier vectors (memory-free) and a single covariance matrix. The\ncovariance matrix is shared by all classes, so that the memory costs are fixed.\nDuring base training, PCU is endowed with the ability to calibrate biased\ndistributions by recurrently updating sampled features under the supervision of\nreal distributions. During incremental learning, PCU recovers distributions for\nold classes to avoid `forgetting', as well as estimating distributions and\naugmenting samples for new classes to alleviate `over-fitting' caused by the\nbiased distributions of few-shot samples. LDC is theoretically plausible by\nformatting a variational inference procedure. It improves FSCIL's flexibility\nas the training procedure requires no class similarity priori. Experiments on\nCUB200, CIFAR100, and mini-ImageNet datasets show that LDC outperforms the\nstate-of-the-arts by 4.64%, 1.98%, and 3.97%, respectively. LDC's effectiveness\nis also validated on few-shot learning scenarios.",

      "abstract": "As businesses get more sizable and more mature they now, inevitably accrete\nmore and more software systems. This estate expansion leads not only to greater\ncomplexity and expense for the enterprise, but also to fragmentation,\ninconsistency and siloing of business processes. Because platform\nrationalisation and system decommissioning never happens spontaneously, a\nperennial problem for the enterprise then becomes how to simplify their\ncorporate software platforms. Recently, Curlew Research personnel were involved\nin a software rationalisation program within a large global life sciences\ncompany and this paper describes an approach to decommissioning which we\ndeveloped as part of that project, and which we feel could be of use more\nwidely to help with objective more user-centric system rationalisation. The\nmethod derives from a model developed by Noriaki Kano et al to help with\ndetermining customer satisfaction and loyalty, and the prioritisation of new,\nadditional functionality, features or \"products\", for example when looking to\nenhance software applications. Using a blueprint process for rationalisation,\nthe Curlew-Kano method enables each application to be placed efficiently and\nobjectively into one of four categories - Retain; Review; Remove; Research -\nthus allowing the enterprise to identify and prioritise quickly those systems\nwhich warrant further investigation as part of a decommissioning activity. The\nkey difference of the Curlew-Kano method compared to other application\nrationalisation methodologies is the fundamental involvement of users in the\nidentification of systems more suitable for rationalisation and possible\ndecommissioning. In our view involving users more fully in system\nrationalisation leads to better outcomes for the enterprise.",

      "abstract": "Linear structural equation models are multivariate statistical models encoded\nby mixed graphs. In particular, the set of covariance matrices for\ndistributions belonging to a linear structural equation model for a fixed mixed\ngraph $G=(V, D,B)$ is parameterized by a rational function with parameters for\neach vertex and edge in $G$. This rational parametrization naturally allows for\nthe study of these models from an algebraic and combinatorial point of view.\nIndeed, this point of view has led to a collection of results in the\nliterature, mainly focusing on questions related to identifiability and\ndetermining relationships between covariances (i.e., finding polynomials in the\nGaussian vanishing ideal). So far, a large proportion of these results has\nfocused on the case when $D$, the directed part of the mixed graph $G$, is\nacyclic. This is due to the fact that in the acyclic case, the parametrization\nbecomes polynomial and there is a description of the entries of the covariance\nmatrices in terms of a finite sum. We move beyond the acyclic case and give a\nclosed form expression for the entries of the covariance matrices in terms of\nthe one-connections in a graph obtained from $D$ through some small operations.\nThis closed form expression then allows us to show that if $G$ is simple, then\nthe parametrization map is generically finite-to-one. Finally, having a closed\nform expression for the covariance matrices allows for the development of an\nalgorithm for systematically exploring possible polynomials in the Gaussian\nvanishing ideal.",

In this paper, we consider multi-frame blind deconvolution\n(MFBD), where image blur is described by the convolution of an unobservable,\nundeteriorated image and an unknown filter, and the objective is to recover the\nundeteriorated image from a sequence of its blurry and noisy observations. We\npresent two new methods for MFBD, which, in contrast to previous work, do not\nrequire the estimation of the unknown filters. The first method is based on\nlikelihood maximization and requires careful initialization to cope with the\nnon-convexity of the loss function. The second method circumvents this\nrequirement and exploits that the solution of likelihood maximization emerges\nas an eigenvector of a specifically constructed matrix, if the signal subspace\nspanned by the observations has a sufficiently large dimension. We describe a\npre-processing step, which increases the dimension of the signal subspace by\nartificially generating additional observations. We also propose an extension\nof the eigenvector method, which copes with insufficient dimensions of the\nsignal subspace by estimating a footprint of the unknown filters (that is a\nvector of the size of the filters, only one is required for the whole image\nsequence). We have applied the eigenvector method to synthetically generated\nimage sequences and performed a quantitative comparison with a previous method,\nobtaining strongly improved results.",

      "abstract": "Speech quality in online conferencing applications is typically assessed\nthrough human judgements in the form of the mean opinion score (MOS) metric.\nSince such a labor-intensive approach is not feasible for large-scale speech\nquality assessments in most settings, the focus has shifted towards automated\nMOS prediction through end-to-end training of deep neural networks (DNN).\nInstead of training a network from scratch, we propose to leverage the speech\nrepresentations from the pre-trained wav2vec-based XLS-R model. However, the\nnumber of parameters of such a model exceeds task-specific DNNs by several\norders of magnitude, which poses a challenge for resulting fine-tuning\nprocedures on smaller datasets. Therefore, we opt to use pre-trained speech\nrepresentations from XLS-R in a feature extraction rather than a fine-tuning\nsetting, thereby significantly reducing the number of trainable model\nparameters. We compare our proposed XLS-R-based feature extractor to a\nMel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC)-based one, and experiment with\nvarious combinations of bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM) and\nattention pooling feedforward (AttPoolFF) networks trained on the output of the\nfeature extractors.

      "abstract": "Regression adjustment is widely used for the analysis of randomized\nexperiments to improve the estimation efficiency of the treatment effect. This\npaper reexamines a weighted regression adjustment method termed as\ntyranny-of-the-minority (ToM), wherein units in the minority group are given\ngreater weights. We demonstrate that the ToM regression adjustment is more\nrobust than Lin 2013's regression adjustment with treatment-covariate\ninteractions, even though these two regression adjustment methods are\nasymptotically equivalent in completely randomized experiments. Moreover, we\nextend ToM regression adjustment to stratified randomized experiments,\ncompletely randomized survey experiments, and cluster randomized experiments.\nWe obtain design-based properties of the ToM regression-adjusted average\ntreatment effect estimator under such designs. In particular, we show that ToM\nregression-adjusted estimator improves the asymptotic estimation efficiency\ncompared to the unadjusted estimator even when the regression model is\nmisspecified, and is optimal in the class of linearly adjusted estimators. We\nalso study the asymptotic properties of various heteroscedasticity-robust\nstandard error estimators and provide recommendations for practitioners.\nSimulation studies and real data analysis demonstrate ToM regression\nadjustment's superiority over existing methods.",

      "abstract": "Blockchains have seen growing traction with cryptocurrencies reaching a\nmarket cap of over 1 trillion dollars, major institution investors taking\ninterests, and global impacts on governments, businesses, and individuals. Also\ngrowing significantly is the heterogeneity of the ecosystem where a variety of\nblockchains co-exist. Cross-chain bridge is a necessary building block in this\nmulti-chain ecosystem. Existing solutions, however, either suffer from\nperformance issues or rely on trust assumptions of committees that\nsignificantly lower the security. Recurring attacks against bridges have cost\nusers more than 1.5 billion USD. In this paper, we introduce zkBridge, an\nefficient cross-chain bridge that guarantees strong security without external\ntrust assumptions. With succinct proofs, zkBridge not only guarantees\ncorrectness, but also significantly reduces on-chain verification cost. We\npropose novel succinct proof protocols that are orders-of-magnitude faster than\nexisting solutions for workload in zkBridge. With a modular design, zkBridge\nenables a broad spectrum of use cases and capabilities, including message\npassing, token transferring, and other computational logic operating on state\nchanges from different chains. To demonstrate the practicality of zkBridge, we\nimplemented a prototype bridge from Cosmos to Ethereum, a particularly\nchallenging direction that involves large proof circuits that existing systems\ncannot efficiently handle. Our evaluation shows that zkBridge achieves\npractical performance: proof generation takes less than 20 seconds, while\nverifying proofs on-chain costs less than 230K gas. For completeness, we also\nimplemented and evaluated the direction from Ethereum to other EVM-compatible\nchains (such as BSC) which involves smaller circuits and incurs much less\noverhead.",

      "abstract": "In class incremental learning (CIL) a model must learn new classes in a\nsequential manner without forgetting old ones. However, conventional CIL\nmethods consider a balanced distribution for each new task, which ignores the\nprevalence of long-tailed distributions in the real world. In this work we\npropose two long-tailed CIL scenarios, which we term ordered and shuffled\nLT-CIL. Ordered LT-CIL considers the scenario where we learn from head classes\ncollected with more samples than tail classes which have few. Shuffled LT-CIL,\non the other hand, assumes a completely random long-tailed distribution for\neach task. We systematically evaluate existing methods in both LT-CIL scenarios\nand demonstrate very different behaviors compared to conventional CIL\nscenarios. Additionally, we propose a two-stage learning baseline with a\nlearnable weight scaling layer for reducing the bias caused by long-tailed\ndistribution in LT-CIL and which in turn also improves the performance of\nconventional CIL due to the limited exemplars. Our results demonstrate the\nsuperior performance (up to 6.44 points in average incremental accuracy) of our\napproach on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-Subset.

      "abstract": "Accurate and reliable prediction of Photovoltaic (PV) power output is\ncritical to electricity grid stability and power dispatching capabilities.\nHowever, Photovoltaic (PV) power generation is highly volatile and unstable due\nto different reasons. The Wavelet Transform (WT) has been utilised in time\nseries applications, such as Photovoltaic (PV) power prediction, to model the\nstochastic volatility and reduce prediction errors. Yet the existing Wavelet\nTransform (WT) approach has a limitation in terms of time complexity. It\nrequires reconstructing the decomposed components and modelling them separately\nand thus needs more time for reconstruction, model configuration and training.\nThe aim of this study is to improve the efficiency of applying Wavelet\nTransform (WT) by proposing a new method that uses a single simplified model.\nGiven a time series and its Wavelet Transform (WT) coefficients, it trains one\nmodel with the coefficients as features and the original time series as labels.\nThis eliminates the need for component reconstruction and training numerous\nmodels. This work contributes to the day-ahead aggregated solar Photovoltaic\n(PV) power time series prediction problem by proposing and comprehensively\nevaluating a new approach of employing WT. The proposed approach is evaluated\nusing 17 months of aggregated solar Photovoltaic (PV) power data from two\nreal-world datasets. The evaluation includes the use of a variety of prediction\nmodels, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression,\nand Convolutional Neural Networks. The results indicate that using a\ncoefficients-based strategy can give predictions that are comparable to those\nobtained using the components-based approach while requiring fewer models and\nless computational time.",

      "abstract": "Sentence-final particles serve an essential role in spoken Japanese because\nthey express the speaker's mental attitudes toward a proposition and/or an\ninterlocutor. They are acquired at early ages and occur very frequently in\neveryday conversation. However, there has been little proposal for a\ncomputational model of acquiring sentence-final particles. This paper proposes\nSubjective BERT, a self-attention model that takes various subjective senses in\naddition to language and images as input and learns the relationship between\nwords and subjective senses. An evaluation experiment revealed that the model\nunderstands the usage of \"yo\", which expresses the speaker's intention to\ncommunicate new information, and that of \"ne\", which denotes the speaker's\ndesire to confirm that some information is shared.",

      "abstract": "We provide a framework for probabilistic reasoning in Vadalog-based Knowledge\nGraphs (KGs), satisfying the requirements of ontological reasoning: full\nrecursion, powerful existential quantification, expression of inductive\ndefinitions. Vadalog is a Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) language\nbased on Warded Datalog+/-, a logical core language of existential rules, with\na good balance between computational complexity and expressive power. Handling\nuncertainty is essential for reasoning with KGs. Yet Vadalog and Warded\nDatalog+/- are not covered by the existing probabilistic logic programming and\nstatistical relational learning approaches for several reasons, including\ninsufficient support for recursion with existential quantification, and the\nimpossibility to express inductive definitions. In this work, we introduce Soft\nVadalog, a probabilistic extension to Vadalog, satisfying these desiderata. A\nSoft Vadalog program induces what we call a Probabilistic Knowledge Graph\n(PKG), which consists of a probability distribution on a network of chase\ninstances, structures obtained by grounding the rules over a database using the\nchase procedure. We exploit PKGs for probabilistic marginal inference. We\ndiscuss the theory and present MCMC-chase, a Monte Carlo method to use Soft\nVadalog in practice.

      "abstract": "We discuss precessing compact binaries on eccentric orbit with gravastar,\nblack hole, neutron star, or boson star components. We derive secular evolution\nequations to second post-Newtonian--order accuracy, with leading-order\nspin-orbit, spin-spin, and mass quadrupole-monopole contributions. The emerging\nclosed system of first-order differential equations evolves the pairs of polar\nand azimuthal angles of the spin and orbital angular momentum vectors together\nwith the periastron angle. The secular dynamics is autonomous. We confirm\nnumerically, that secular evolutions look like smoothed-out instantaneous\nevolutions over timescales where radiation reaction is negligible. The secular\nevolution of the spin polar angles and the difference of their azimuthal angles\ngenerates a closed subsystem. We study analytically this system for the\nparticular cases of one spin dominating over the other and for black hole -\nboson star binaries of equal masses. In the first case known large flip-flops\nof the smaller spin are reproduced, when the larger spin is almost coplanar\nwith the orbit. We also find new, quadrupole-induced flip-flops occurring when\nthe neutron star with dominant spin has a quadrupolar parameter $w_1\\approx 3$.\nFinally we analyze the evolutions of the spin angles numerically by comparing\nthe cases when the black hole companion is either a gravastar, another black\nhole or a boson star with identical mass. We find that both the amplitude and\nperiod of the flip-flop are the largest, when the companion is a black hole. In\nthe case of a boson star companion the frequency of the flip-flop increases\nsignificantly. Further, while in the case of gravastars and black holes a\nswinging-type azimuthal evolution occurs, with the spins of the components\nperiodically overpassing each other, their sequence is conserved when the\ncompanion is a boson star.",

Through a dynamical system\nanalysis, we investigate their linear stability as function of the mass\nquadrupole parameter. Marginal stability holds for the binary configurations\nwith both spins antialigned to the orbital angular momentum, for both spins\naligned to the orbital angular momentum (with the exception of certain\nquadrupolar parameter ranges of neutron stars and boson stars), and for the\nextremal mass ratio. For equal masses, the configurations of one of the spins\naligned and the other antialigned is stable for gravastar binaries, for neutron\nstar binaries in the high quadrupolar parameter range, and for boson star\nbinaries. For some unequal mass gravastar binaries, black hole binaries or\nneutron star binaries, a transition from stability to instability can occur\nduring the inspiral, when one of the spins is aligned, while the other is\nantialigned to the orbital angular momentum. We discover a transitional\ninstability regime during the inspiral of certain gravastar, neutron star, or\nboson star binaries with opposing spins. For coplanar configurations we find\ninstabilities only for the gravastar - gravastar, boson star - boson star and\nblack hole - boson star binaries. For a given spin configuration, marginal\nstability strongly depends on the value of the quadrupolar parameters.

      "abstract": "We apply a recently developed 2+1+1 decomposition of spacetime, based on a\nnonorthogonal double foliation for the study of spherically symmetric, static\nblack hole solutions of Horndeski scalar-tensor theory. Our discussion proceeds\nin an effective field theory (EFT) of modified gravity approach, with the\naction depending on metric and embedding scalars adapted to the nonorthogonal\n2+1+1 decomposition. We prove that the most generic class of Horndeski\nLagrangians compatible with observations can be expressed in this EFT form. By\nstudying the first order perturbation of the EFT action we derive three\nequations of motion, which reduce to those derived earlier in an orthogonal\n2+1+1 decomposition, and a fourth equation for the metric parameter N related\nto the nonorthogonality of the foliation. For the Horndeski class of theories\nwith vanishing $G_3$ and $G_5$, but generic functions $G_2(\\phi,X)$ (k-essence)\nand $G_4(\\phi)$ (nonminimal coupling to the metric) we prove the unicity\ntheorem that no action beyond Einstein--Hilbert allows for the Schwarzschild\nsolution. Next we integrate the EFT field equations for the case with only one\nindependent metric function obtaining new solutions characterized by a\nparameter interpreted as either mass or tidal charge, the cosmological constant\nand a third parameter. These solutions represent naked singularities, black\nholes with scalar hair or have the double horizon structure of the\nSchwarzschild--de Sitter spacetime. Solutions with homogeneous Kantowski--Sachs\ntype regions also emerge. Finally, one of the solutions obtained for the\nfunction $G_4$ linear in the curvature coordinate, in certain parameter range\nexhibits an intriguing logarithmic singularity lying outside the horizon. The\nnewly derived hairy black hole solutions evade previously known unicity\ntheorems by being asymptotically nonflat, even in the absence of the\ncosmological constant.",

We proposed the DeltaBound attack: a novel,\npowerful attack in the hard-label setting with $\\ell_2$ norm bounded\nperturbations. In this scenario, the attacker has only access to the top-1\npredicted label of the model and can be therefore applied to real-world\nsettings such as remote API. This is a complex problem since the attacker has\nvery little information about the model.

      "abstract": "We propose a federated methodology to learn low-dimensional representations\nfrom a dataset that is distributed among several clients. In particular, we\nmove away from the commonly-used cross-entropy loss in federated learning, and\nseek to learn shared low-dimensional representations of the data in a\ndecentralized manner via the principle of maximal coding rate reduction (MCR2).\nOur proposed method, which we refer to as FLOW, utilizes MCR2 as the objective\nof choice, hence resulting in representations that are both between-class\ndiscriminative and within-class compressible. We theoretically show that our\ndistributed algorithm achieves a first-order stationary point. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate, via numerical experiments, the utility of the learned\nlow-dimensional representations.",

      "abstract": "The wind tunnel rotary-balance testing is widely used in aircraft dynamics to\ncharacterise aerodynamics at moderate and high angles of attack during stall\nand spin regimes. In such experiments an aircraft test model is rotated along\nthe wind-tunnel free-stream velocity vector allowing the measurement of\naerodynamic characteristics in steady rotational flow conditions with constant\nangle of attack and sideslip. In modified tests named as oscillatory coning,\nthe rotation vector is tilted from the free-stream velocity vector making flow\nconditions with periodic variations in angle of attack and sideslip. This\nallows evaluation of unsteady aerodynamic responses superimposed on steady\nconical rotation. The use of CFD methods for prediction of aerodynamic\ncharacteristics in rotary-balance and oscillatory coning conditions may\nsignificantly complement experimental data via extrapolation of data for higher\nReynolds numbers, elimination of interference effects from supporting system,\nextraction of unsteady aerodynamic derivatives affecting aircraft dynamic\nstability. This paper presents CFD simulation results obtained in\nrotary-balance and oscillatory coning motions for the NASA Common Research\nModel (CRM) in its wing-body configuration at moderate $Re=1\\times10^6$, low\nMach number $M\\mbox{=}0.2$ and the use of the obtained unsteady responses in\naerodynamic modelling.",

      "abstract": "Clustering based on the random walk operator has been proven effective for\nundirected graphs, but its generalization to directed graphs (digraphs) is much\nmore challenging. Although the random walk operator is well-defined for\ndigraphs, in most cases such graphs are not strongly connected, and hence the\nassociated random walks are not irreducible, which is a crucial property for\nclustering that exists naturally in the undirected setting. To remedy this, the\nusual workaround is to either naively symmetrize the adjacency matrix or to\nreplace the natural random walk operator by the teleporting random walk\noperator, but this can lead to the loss of valuable information carried by edge\ndirectionality. In this paper, we introduce a new clustering framework, the\nParametrized Random Walk Diffusion Kernel Clustering (P-RWDKC), which is\nsuitable for handling both directed and undirected graphs. Our framework is\nbased on the diffusion geometry and the generalized spectral clustering\nframework. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm that automatically reveals the\ncluster structure at a given scale, by considering the random walk dynamics\nassociated with a parametrized kernel operator, and by estimating its critical\ndiffusion time. Experiments on $K$-NN graphs constructed from real-world\ndatasets and real-world graphs show that our clustering approach performs well\nin all tested cases, and outperforms existing approaches in most of them.",

In this work we rigorously demonstrate that\nbowtie elements allow for a significant improvement in the beamforming\nperformance of the hybrid antenna array compared to not only other available\nantenna arrays, but also its geometrical counterpart with dipole elements. We\nhave achieved a greater than 15 dB increase in SINR values, a greater than 20%\nimprovement in the antenna efficiency, a significant enhancement in the DoA\nestimation, and 20 increments in the directivity for the hybrid antenna array\nwith bowtie elements, compared to its geometrical counterpart, by performing a\nthree-class classification LS-SVM (LeastSquares Support Vector Machine)\noptimization method. The proposed hybrid antenna array has shown a 3D uniform\ndirectivity, which is accompanied by its superior performance in the 3D uniform\nbeam-scanning capability. The directivities remain almost constant at 40.83 dBi\nwith the variation of angle {\\theta}, and 41.21 dBi with the variation of angle\n{\\phi}.

The transition from the traditional\nrepresentation of the complex amplitude of the received field as a function of\ndepth and time to a function representing the field distribution in the phase\nspace `depth - angle - time' is considered. Due to the absence of multipath and\nproblems with caustics, the sound field distribution in phase space is less\nsensitive to environmental disturbances and therefore more predictable than in\nconfiguration space. The transition is carried out using the coherent state\nexpansion developed in the quantum theory. The found distribution of the field\nintensity in the phase space agrees with the calculation performed with an\nidealized environmental model. It is shown that this distribution can be taken\nas the input for solving the problem of source localization. The results of\ndata processing demonstrate the possibility of using the coherent state\nexpansion for isolating the field component formed by a given beam of rays.",

      "abstract": "Discontinuous shear thickening (DST) is associated with a sharp rise of a\nsuspension's viscosity with increasing applied shear rate. A key signature of\nDST, highlighted in recent studies, is the very large fluctuations of the\nmeasured stress as the suspension thickens. A clear link between\nmicrostructural development and the dramatic increase of the stress\nfluctuations has not been established yet. To identify the microstructural\nunderpinnings of this behavior, we perform simulations of sheared dense\nsuspensions. By analyzing particle contact networks, we identify a subset of\nconstrained particles that contribute directly to the rapid rise in viscosity\nand the large stress fluctuations. Indeed, both phenomena can be explained by\nthe growth and percolation of constrained particle networks -- in direct\nanalogy to rigidity percolation. A finite size scaling analysis confirms this\nis a percolation phenomenon and allows us to estimate the critical exponents.\nOur findings reveal the specific microstructural transition that underlies DST.",

      "abstract": "Standard practice in pretraining multimodal models, such as vision-language\nmodels, is to rely on pairs of aligned inputs from both modalities, for\nexample, aligned image-text pairs. However, such pairs can be difficult to\nobtain in low-resource settings and for some modality pairs (e.g., structured\ntables and images). In this work, we investigate the extent to which we can\nreduce the reliance on such parallel data, which we term \\emph{bimodal\nsupervision}, and use models that are pretrained on each modality\nindependently. We experiment with a high-performing vision-language model, and\nanalyze the effect of bimodal supervision on three vision-language tasks. We\nfind that on simpler tasks, such as VQAv2 and GQA, one can eliminate bimodal\nsupervision completely, suffering only a minor loss in performance. Conversely,\nfor NLVR2, which requires more complex reasoning, training without bimodal\nsupervision leads to random performance. Nevertheless, using only 5\\% of the\nbimodal data (142K images along with their captions), or leveraging weak\nsupervision in the form of a list of machine-generated labels for each image,\nleads to only a moderate degradation compared to using 3M image-text pairs:\n74\\%$\\rightarrow$$\\sim$70\\%.

To push AT towards more practical scenarios, we\nexplore a brand new yet challenging setting, i.e., AT with complementary labels\n(CLs), which specify a class that a data sample does not belong to. However,\nthe direct combination of AT with existing methods for CLs results in\nconsistent failure, but not on a simple baseline of two-stage training. In this\npaper, we further explore the phenomenon and identify the underlying challenges\nof AT with CLs as intractable adversarial optimization and low-quality\nadversarial examples. To address the above problems, we propose a new learning\nstrategy using gradually informative attacks, which consists of two critical\ncomponents: 1) Warm-up Attack (Warm-up) gently raises the adversarial\nperturbation budgets to ease the adversarial optimization with CLs; 2)\nPseudo-Label Attack (PLA) incorporates the progressively informative model\npredictions into a corrected complementary loss.

      "abstract": "Widespread applications of deep neural networks (DNNs) benefit from DNN\ntesting to guarantee their quality. In the DNN testing, numerous test cases are\nfed into the model to explore potential vulnerabilities, but they require\nexpensive manual cost to check the label. Therefore, test case prioritization\nis proposed to solve the problem of labeling cost, e.g., activation-based and\nmutation-based prioritization methods. However, most of them suffer from\nlimited scenarios (i.e. high confidence adversarial or false positive cases)\nand high time complexity. To address these challenges, we propose the concept\nof the activation graph from the perspective of the spatial relationship of\nneurons. We observe that the activation graph of cases that triggers the\nmodels' misbehavior significantly differs from that of normal cases. Motivated\nby it, we design a test case prioritization method based on the activation\ngraph, ActGraph, by extracting the high-order node features of the activation\ngraph for prioritization. ActGraph explains the difference between the test\ncases to solve the problem of scenario limitation. Without mutation operations,\nActGraph is easy to implement, leading to lower time complexity. Extensive\nexperiments on three datasets and four models demonstrate that ActGraph has the\nfollowing key characteristics. (i) Effectiveness and generalizability: ActGraph\nshows competitive performance in all of the natural, adversarial and mixed\nscenarios, especially in RAUC-100 improvement (~1.40). (ii) Efficiency:\nActGraph does not use complex mutation operations and runs in less time (~1/50)\nthan the state-of-the-art method.",

      "abstract": "We describe the relative $K_0$-groups of orders in finite dimensional\nseparable algebras over the fraction fields of Dedekind domains of\ncharacteristic zero in terms of the theory of reduced determinant functors\nintroduced in [20]. We then use this approach to formulate, for each odd prime\n$p$, a main conjecture of non-commutative $p$-adic Iwasawa theory for\n$\\mathbb{G}_m$ over arbitrary number fields. This conjecture predicts a precise\nrelation between a canonical Rubin-Stark non-commutative Euler system that we\ndefine and the compactly supported $p$-adic cohomology of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ and\nsimultaneously extends both the higher rank (commutative) main conjecture for\n$\\mathbb{G}_m$ studied by Kurihara and the present authors and the formalism of\nmain conjectures in non-commutative Iwasawa theory due to Ritter and Weiss and\nto Coates, Fukaya, Kato, Sujatha and Venjakob. Our approach also suggests a\nprecise conjectural `higher derivative formula' for the Rubin-Stark\nnon-commutative Euler system that extends the classical Gross-Stark Conjecture\nto the setting of Galois extensions of arbitrary number fields. We present\nstrong evidence in support of both of these conjectures in the setting of\narbitrary Galois CM extensions of totally real fields. In addition, in the\ngeneral case, we show that the conjectures can be combined to establish a new\nstrategy for obtaining evidence in support of the equivariant Tamagawa Number\nConjecture for $\\mathbb{G}_m$ over arbitrary Galois extensions.",

      "abstract": "Network or physical attacks on industrial equipment or computer systems may\ncause massive losses. Therefore, a quick and accurate anomaly detection (AD)\nbased on monitoring data, especially the multivariate time-series (MTS) data,\nis of great significance. As the key step of anomaly detection for MTS data,\nlearning the relations among different variables has been explored by many\napproaches. However, most of the existing approaches do not consider the\nheterogeneity between variables, that is, different types of variables\n(continuous numerical variables, discrete categorical variables or hybrid\nvariables) may have different and distinctive edge distributions. In this\npaper, we propose a novel semi-supervised anomaly detection framework based on\na heterogeneous feature network (HFN) for MTS, learning heterogeneous structure\ninformation from a mass of unlabeled time-series data to improve the accuracy\nof anomaly detection, and using attention coefficient to provide an explanation\nfor the detected anomalies. Specifically, we first combine the embedding\nsimilarity subgraph generated by sensor embedding and feature value similarity\nsubgraph generated by sensor values to construct a time-series heterogeneous\ngraph, which fully utilizes the rich heterogeneous mutual information among\nvariables. Then, a prediction model containing nodes and channel attentions is\njointly optimized to obtain better time-series representations. This approach\nfuses the state-of-the-art technologies of heterogeneous graph structure\nlearning (HGSL) and representation learning. The experiments on four sensor\ndatasets from real-world applications demonstrate that our approach detects the\nanomalies more accurately than those baseline approaches, thus providing a\nbasis for the rapid positioning of anomalies.",

A special focus\nis placed on the microscopic formulation of this model by using the mean-field\nmethod that is based on the framework of nuclear density functional theory. As\nan illustrative example, a stable octupole deformation, and a shape phase\ntransition as a function of nucleon number that involves both quadrupole and\noctupole degrees of freedom are shown to occur in light actinides. Systematic\nspectroscopic studies indicate enhancement of the octupole collectivity in a\nwide mass region.

      "title": "Using Shell Models to Investigate Clumping in the WN4 Star HD 50896",
      "abstract": "The spectra of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars exhibit strong, broad emission lines\nthat originate in the wind. These winds are radiatively driven and are\nsusceptible to hydrodynamic instabilities that result in the formation of\nclumps. When modelling spectra of WR stars the volume-filling factor (VFF)\napproach is usually employed to treat clumpy winds. However, it is based on the\nassumption that the entire wind mass resides in optically thin clumps, which is\nnot necessarily justifiable in dense winds. To test the validity of the VFF\napproach we use a previously described method of treating clumping, the\n``Shell'' approach, to study line and continuum formation in the dense wind of\nthe WN4 star, HD 50896. Our models indicate that fully intact spherical shells\nare in tension with observed spectra; a persistent ``dip'' in emission lines\noccurs at line centre. Removing this dip requires our models to use ``broken''\nshells -- shells that are highly decoherent laterally. This insinuates that the\nwind of HD 50896, and by extension the winds of other WR stars, are comprised\nof small laterally confined and radially compressed clumps -- clumps smaller\nthan the Sobolev length. We discuss some of the conditions necessary for the\nVFF approach to be valid.",

Given a point set $V\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ that\nis partitioned into $s$ groups $V_1,..., V_s$, and integers $k_1,...,k_s$ where\n$k=\\sum_i k_i$, the goal is to pick $k_i$ points from group $i$ such that the\noverall determinant of the picked $k$ points is maximized. Determinant\nMaximization and its constrained variants have gained a lot of interest for\nmodeling diversityand have found applications in the context of fairness and\ndata summarization.\n  We study the design of composable coresets for the constrained determinant\nmaximization problem. Composable coresets are small subsets of the data that\n(approximately) preserve optimal solutions to optimization tasks and enable\nefficient solutions in several other large data models including the\ndistributed and the streaming settings. In this work, we consider two regimes.\nFor the case of $k>d$, we show a peeling algorithm that gives us a composable\ncoreset of size $kd$ with an approximation factor of $d^{O(d)}$. We complement\nour results by showing that this approximation factor is tight. For the case of\n$k\\leq d$, we show that a simple modification of the previous algorithms\nresults in an optimal coreset verified by our lower bounds.

      "abstract": "In this paper we consider Bayesian parameter inference for partially observed\nfractional Brownian motion (fBM) models. The approach we follow is to\ntime-discretize the hidden process and then to design Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) algorithms to sample from the posterior density on the parameters given\ndata. We rely on a novel representation of the time discretization, which seeks\nto sample from an approximation of the posterior and then corrects via\nimportance sampling; the approximation reduces the time (in terms of total\nobservation time T) by O(T). This method is extended by using a multilevel MCMC\nmethod which can reduce the computational cost to achieve a given mean square\nerror (MSE) versus using a single time discretization. Our methods are\nillustrated on simulated and real data.",

      "abstract": "By exploiting the extreme environment of the black hole (BH) as a potential\nplace for axion-photon interaction, we use an axion-producing model of the\nmagnetized plasma to study the shadow of an asymptotically flat rotating BH\nimmersed into an axion-plasmon cloud. By aiming to reveal footprints of axion\nin the dark shadow of BH, we in this paper explore the influence of the fixed\naxion-plasmon background on the motion of incident photons around the rotating\nBH. Under some free parameter settings, we find that axion-plasmon cloud around\nrotating BH affects the shape and size of the shadow in such a way that its\nrole is distinguishable from non-magnetized plasma and standard vacuum\nsolutions. By being limited to high rotation BH, we show that the size of the\nBH shadow increases as the axion-plasmon coupling gets strong. Interestingly,\nour analysis indicates that as the mass of axion gets heavier, it can leave a\nsubtle imprint of itself on the shadow. Conversely, in the non-rotating limit\n(Schwarzschild), by recovering the spherical symmetry of the shadow shape of\nBH, its size decreases. In coordination with the trend of change in shadow\nsize, the investigation of the energy emission from the BH surrounded by the\nmagnetized plasma shows that the maximal energy emission rate from the rotating\nBH in the presence of axion-plasmon cloud increases compared to the\nnon-magnetized plasma and the vacuum solutions. Subsequently, by relaxing the\nrotation, the axion-plasmon cloud causes a decrease in the energy emission rate\nfrom the BH.",

      "abstract": "Many recent named entity recognition (NER) studies criticize flat NER for its\nnon-overlapping assumption, and switch to investigating nested NER. However,\nexisting nested NER models heavily rely on training data annotated with nested\nentities, while labeling such data is costly. This study proposes a new\nsubtask, nested-from-flat NER, which corresponds to a realistic application\nscenario: given data annotated with flat entities only, one may still desire\nthe trained model capable of recognizing nested entities. To address this task,\nwe train span-based models and deliberately ignore the spans nested inside\nlabeled entities, since these spans are possibly unlabeled entities. With\nnested entities removed from the training data, our model achieves 54.8%, 54.2%\nand 41.1% F1 scores on the subset of spans within entities on ACE 2004, ACE\n2005 and GENIA, respectively. This suggests the effectiveness of our approach\nand the feasibility of the task. In addition, the model's performance on flat\nentities is entirely unaffected. We further manually annotate the nested\nentities in the test set of CoNLL 2003, creating a nested-from-flat NER\nbenchmark. Analysis results show that the main challenges stem from the data\nand annotation inconsistencies between the flat and nested entities.",

Voxel-wise uncertainty is a useful visual\nmarker for human experts and could be used to improve the model's voxel-wise\noutput, such as segmentation. Moreover, uncertainty provides a solid foundation\nfor out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, improving the model performance on the\nimage-wise level. However, one of the frequent tasks in medical imaging is the\nsegmentation of distinct, local structures such as tumors or lesions. Here, the\nstructure-wise uncertainty allows more precise operations than image-wise and\nmore semantic-aware than voxel-wise. The way to produce uncertainty for\nindividual structures remains poorly explored. We propose a framework to\nmeasure the structure-wise uncertainty and evaluate the impact of OOD data on\nthe model performance. Thus, we identify the best UE method to improve the\nsegmentation quality.

      "abstract": "Modern data centers have grown beyond CPU nodes to provide domain-specific\naccelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs to their customers.

They are willing to pay\nadditional costs for trusted execution environments such as enclaves provided\nby Intel SGX and AMD SEV. Unfortunately, the customers have to make a critical\nchoice -- either use domain-specific accelerators for speed or use CPU-based\nconfidential computing solutions. To bridge this gap, we aim to enable\ndata-center scale confidential computing that expands across CPUs and\naccelerators. We argue that having wide-scale TEE-support for accelerators\npresents a technically easier solution, but is far away from being a reality.\nInstead, our hybrid design provides enclaved execution guarantees for\ncomputation distributed over multiple CPU nodes and devices with/without TEE\nsupport. Our solution scales gracefully in two dimensions -- it can handle a\nlarge number of heterogeneous nodes and it can accommodate TEE-enabled devices\nas and when they are available in the future. We observe marginal overheads of\n$0.42$--$8\\%$ on real-world AI data center workloads that are independent of\nthe number of nodes in the data center.

      "abstract": "There is a critical need for efficient and reliable active flow control\nstrategies to reduce drag and noise in aerospace and marine engineering\napplications. While traditional full-order models based on the Navier-Stokes\nequations are not feasible, advanced model reduction techniques can be\ninefficient for active control tasks, especially with strong non-linearity and\nconvection-dominated phenomena. Using convolutional recurrent autoencoder\nnetwork architectures, deep learning-based reduced-order models have been\nrecently shown to be effective while performing several orders of magnitude\nfaster than full-order simulations. However, these models encounter significant\nchallenges outside the training data, limiting their effectiveness for active\ncontrol and optimization tasks. In this study, we aim to improve the\nextrapolation capability by modifying network architecture and integrating\ncoupled space-time physics as an implicit bias. Reduced-order models via deep\nlearning generally employ decoupling in spatial and temporal dimensions, which\ncan introduce modeling and approximation errors. To alleviate these errors, we\npropose a novel technique for learning coupled spatial-temporal correlation\nusing a 3D convolution network. We assess the proposed technique against a\nstandard encoder-propagator-decoder model and demonstrate a superior\nextrapolation performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D convolution\nnetwork, we consider a benchmark problem of the flow past a circular cylinder\nat laminar flow conditions and use the spatio-temporal snapshots from the\nfull-order simulations. Our proposed 3D convolution architecture accurately\ncaptures the velocity and pressure fields for varying Reynolds numbers.\nCompared to the standard encoder-propagator-decoder network, the\nspatio-temporal-based 3D convolution network improves the prediction range of\nReynolds numbers outside of the training data.",

      "abstract": "We generalize the iterative diagonalization procedure adopted in method of\nnumerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in strong magnetic\nfields, where the density of states for itinerary electrons at the chemical\npotential varies discontinuously as the magnetic field changes. We first\nexamine phases of many-body ground states in the presence of single impurity.\nBy investigating change of $z$-component of total spin, $\\Delta S_z$, and\nspin-spin correlation between the impurity and conduction electrons, we find\nthat there are three states competing for the ground state when Zeeman\nsplitting is present. One of the states is doublet in which the impurity spin\nis unscreened. The other two states are Kondo screening states with $\\Delta\nS_z=1/2$ and $\\Delta S_z=1$, in which the impurity spin is partially screened\nand completely screened respectively. For Kondo systems with two-impurities in\nstrong magnetic fields, we find that the interplay between the Kondo screening\neffect, RKKY interaction, and quantum oscillations due to Landau levels\ndetermines the ground state of the system. Combination of these three factors\nresults in different screening scenarios for different phases in which spins of\ntwo impurities can form spin-0 or spin-1 states, while impurity spins in these\nphases can be either screened, partially screened, or unscreened by conduction\nelectrons. The emergence of the ground state from these competing states\noscillates with the change of magnetic field, chemical potential or\ninter-impurity distance. This leads to quantum oscillations in magnetization\nand conductivity. In particular, we find extra peak structures in longitudinal\nconductivity that reflect changes of Kondo screening phases and are important\nfeatures to be observed in experiments.

      "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are one of the powerful unsupervised learning\nframeworks in NLP for latent representation learning and latent-directed\ngeneration. The classic optimization goal of VAEs is to maximize the Evidence\nLower Bound (ELBo), which consists of a conditional likelihood for generation\nand a negative Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for regularization. In\npractice, optimizing ELBo often leads the posterior distribution of all samples\nconverge to the same degenerated local optimum, namely posterior collapse or KL\nvanishing. There are effective ways proposed to prevent posterior collapse in\nVAEs, but we observe that they in essence make trade-offs between posterior\ncollapse and hole problem, i.e., mismatch between the aggregated posterior\ndistribution and the prior distribution. To this end, we introduce new training\nobjectives to tackle both two problems through a novel regularization based on\nthe probabilistic density gap between the aggregated posterior distribution and\nthe prior distribution. Through experiments on language modeling, latent space\nvisualization and interpolation, we show that our proposed method can solve\nboth problems effectively and thus outperforms the existing methods in\nlatent-directed generation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\njointly solve the hole problem and the posterior collapse.",

      "title": "DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models towards Adversarial Robustness",
      "abstract": "Diffusion models have been recently employed to improve certified robustness\nthrough the process of denoising. However, the theoretical understanding of why\ndiffusion models are able to improve the certified robustness is still lacking,\npreventing from further improvement. In this study, we close this gap by\nanalyzing the fundamental properties of diffusion models and establishing the\nconditions under which they can enhance certified robustness. This deeper\nunderstanding allows us to propose a new method DensePure, designed to improve\nthe certified robustness of a pretrained model (i.e. classifier). Given an\n(adversarial) input, DensePure consists of multiple runs of denoising via the\nreverse process of the diffusion model (with different random seeds) to get\nmultiple reversed samples, which are then passed through the classifier,\nfollowed by majority voting of inferred labels to make the final prediction.\nThis design of using multiple runs of denoising is informed by our theoretical\nanalysis of the conditional distribution of the reversed sample. Specifically,\nwhen the data density of a clean sample is high, its conditional density under\nthe reverse process in a diffusion model is also high; thus sampling from the\nlatter conditional distribution can purify the adversarial example and return\nthe corresponding clean sample with a high probability. By using the highest\ndensity point in the conditional distribution as the reversed sample, we\nidentify the robust region of a given instance under the diffusion model's\nreverse process. We show that this robust region is a union of multiple convex\nsets, and is potentially much larger than the robust regions identified in\nprevious works. In practice, DensePure can approximate the label of the high\ndensity region in the conditional distribution so that it can enhance certified\nrobustness.",

      "abstract": "To let the state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR model enjoy data efficiency, as\nwell as much more unpaired text data by multi-modal training, one needs to\naddress two problems: 1) the synchronicity of feature sampling rates between\nspeech and language (aka text data); 2) the homogeneity of the learned\nrepresentations from two encoders. In this paper we propose to employ a novel\nbidirectional attention mechanism (BiAM) to jointly learn both ASR encoder\n(bottom layers) and text encoder with a multi-modal learning method. The BiAM\nis to facilitate feature sampling rate exchange, realizing the quality of the\ntransformed features for the one kind to be measured in another space, with\ndiversified objective functions. As a result, the speech representations are\nenriched with more linguistic information, while the representations generated\nby the text encoder are more similar to corresponding speech ones, and\ntherefore the shared ASR models are more amenable for unpaired text data\npretraining. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, we perform two\ncategories of experiments with or without extra unpaired text data.\nExperimental results on Librispeech corpus show it can achieve up to 6.15% word\nerror rate reduction (WERR) with only paired data learning, while 9.23% WERR\nwhen more unpaired text data is employed.",

A model is developed to\ncalculate the shadowing losses on the PV panels along with the reduced solar\nirradiation reaching the area under them for different PV capacity densities.\nFirst, we investigate the trade-offs using a location in Denmark as a case\nstudy and second, we extrapolate the analysis to the rest of Europe. We find\nthat the vertical and single-axis tracking produce more uniform irradiance on\nthe ground, and a capacity density of around 30 W/m2 is suitable for APV\nsystems. Based on our model and a 100 m-resolution land cover database, we\ncalculate the potential for APV in every NUTS-2 region within the European\nUnion (EU). The potential for APV is enormous as the electricity generated by\nAPV systems could produce 28 times the current electricity demand in Europe.\nOverall, the potential capacity for APV in Europe is 51 TW, which would result\nin an electricity yield of 71500 TWh/year.",

Generally, a system with\none-bit agent memory and $O(1)$-bit storage is as powerful as that with\n$O(n)$-bit agent memory and $O(1)$-bit storage. Thus, we focus on the\ndifference between one-bit memory and oblivious (i.e., zero-bit memory) agents.\nAlthough their computational powers are not equivalent, all the known results\nexhibiting such a difference rely on the fact that oblivious agents cannot\ntransfer any information from one side to the other across the bridge edge.\nHence, our main question is as follows: Are the computational powers of one-bit\nmemory and oblivious agents equivalent in 2-edge-connected graphs or not? The\nmain contribution of this study is to answer this question under the relaxed\nassumption that each node has $O(\\log\\Delta)$-bit storage (where $\\Delta$ is\nthe maximum degree of the graph). We present an algorithm for simulating any\nalgorithm for a single one-bit memory agent using an oblivious agent with\n$O(n^2)$-time overhead per round.

The non-linear equations describe spatiotemporal patterns of\ncrystalline order and chaotic randomness at two extreme values of the system\nparameter.

      "abstract": "We discuss a GC formation scenario in which the first generation (1G) of\nsingle asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and intermediate-mass close binaries\n(IMCBs) eject gas, from which the second generation (2G) of stars can be\nformed. The two key parameters in the scenario are the fractions of binary\nstars (f_b) and the slopes (alpha) of the stellar initial mass functions (IMFs)\nfor 1G stars. Principle results derived by analytic and one-zone models of GC\nformation are as follows. The mass fraction of 2G stars (f_2g) can be higher\nthan ~0.4 for alpha < 1.8 and is not so dependent on f_b. The ratio of the\ninitial mass of a GC to the present-day mass (M_gc) ranges from 2 to 7\ndepending on alpha for 0.5 < f_b <0.9. The differences in [Na/Fe] between 1G\nand 2G stars can be as large as 0.7 for a wide range of model parameters. The\nLi abundances of 2G stars can be as high as those of 1G even if the pristine\ngas from IMCBs is assumed to be Li-free. Formation histories of 2G stars show\nat least two peaks owing to two peaks in the total ejection rate of gas from\nIMCB populations. The observed correlation between f_2g and M_gc can be due to\nalpha depending on M_gc. The hypothetical long duration of 2G formation (~ 10^8\nyr) is possible, because massive star formation can be suppressed through\nfrequent dynamical interaction between 1G stars and gas clouds.",

      "title": "Siamese Transition Masked Autoencoders as Uniform Unsupervised Visual\n  Anomaly Detector",
      "abstract": "Unsupervised visual anomaly detection conveys practical significance in many\nscenarios and is a challenging task due to the unbounded definition of\nanomalies. Moreover, most previous methods are application-specific, and\nestablishing a unified model for anomalies across application scenarios remains\nunsolved. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework termed Siamese\nTransition Masked Autoencoders(ST-MAE) to handle various visual anomaly\ndetection tasks uniformly via deep feature transition. Concretely, the proposed\nmethod first extracts hierarchical semantics features from a pre-trained deep\nconvolutional neural network and then develops a feature decoupling strategy to\nsplit the deep features into two disjoint feature patch subsets. Leveraging the\ndecoupled features, the ST-MAE is developed with the Siamese encoders that\noperate on each subset of feature patches and perform the latent\nrepresentations transition of two subsets, along with a lightweight decoder\nthat reconstructs the original feature from the transitioned latent\nrepresentation. Finally, the anomalous attributes can be detected using the\nsemantic deep feature residual. Our deep feature transition scheme yields a\nnontrivial and semantic self-supervisory task to extract prototypical normal\npatterns, which allows for learning uniform models that generalize well for\ndifferent visual anomaly detection tasks. The extensive experiments conducted\ndemonstrate that the proposed ST-MAE method can advance state-of-the-art\nperformance on multiple benchmarks across application scenarios with a superior\ninference efficiency, which exhibits great potential to be the uniform model\nfor unsupervised visual anomaly detection.",

      "abstract": "Humans use audio signals in the form of spoken language or verbal reactions\neffectively when teaching new skills or tasks to other humans. While\ndemonstrations allow humans to teach robots in a natural way, learning from\ntrajectories alone does not leverage other available modalities including audio\nfrom human teachers. To effectively utilize audio cues accompanying human\ndemonstrations, first it is important to understand what kind of information is\npresent and conveyed by such cues. This work characterizes audio from human\nteachers demonstrating multi-step manipulation tasks to a situated Sawyer robot\nusing three feature types: (1) duration of speech used, (2) expressiveness in\nspeech or prosody, and (3) semantic content of speech. We analyze these\nfeatures along four dimensions and find that teachers convey similar semantic\nconcepts via spoken words for different conditions of (1) demonstration types,\n(2) audio usage instructions, (3) subtasks, and (4) errors during\ndemonstrations. However, differentiating properties of speech in terms of\nduration and expressiveness are present along the four dimensions, highlighting\nthat human audio carries rich information, potentially beneficial for\ntechnological advancement of robot learning from demonstration methods.",

      "abstract": "A vital condition for life on Earth is the steady supply of radiative heat by\nthe Sun. Like all other stars, the Sun generates its emitted energy in its\ncentral regions where densities and temperatures are high enough for nuclear\nfusion processes to take place. Because stellar cores are usually covered by an\nopaque envelope, most of our knowledge about them and their life-giving nuclear\nprocesses comes from theoretical modelling or from indirect observations such\nas the detection of solar neutrinos and the study of stellar pulsations,\nrespectively. Only in very rare cases, stars may expose their cores, e.g., when\na tiny fraction of them evolves into Wolf-Rayet or helium hot subdwarf stars.\nHowever, for the vast majority of stars, namely unevolved stars that burn\nhydrogen to helium in their centres, direct observational clues on the cores\nare still missing. Based on a comprehensive spectroscopic and asteroseismic\nanalysis, we show here that the bright B-type star $\\gamma$ Columbae is the\nstripped pulsating core (with a mass of $4$-$5\\,M_\\odot$, where $M_\\odot$ is\nthe mass of the Sun) of a previously much more massive star of roughly\n$12\\,M_\\odot$ that just finished central hydrogen fusion. The star's inferred\nparameters indicate that it is still in a short-lived post-stripping structural\nreadjustment phase, making it an extremely rare object. The discovery of this\nunique star paves the way to obtain invaluable insights into the physics of\nboth single and binary stars with respect to nuclear astrophysics and\ncommon-envelope evolution. In particular, it provides first observational\nconstraints on the structure and evolution of stripped envelope stars.",

Results: We identify 13 bugs for eight engines, and also\nidentify other constraints. We provide recommendations for tackling these\nissues. Conclusions: There is still a considerable gap between the search-needs\nof researchers and the usability of academic search engines. It is not clear\nwhether search-engine developers are aware of this gap. Also, the evaluation,\nby academics, of academic search engines has not kept pace with the\ndevelopment, by search-engine providers, of those search engines. Thus, the gap\nbetween evaluation and development makes it harder to properly understand the\ngap between the search-needs of researchers and search-features of the search\nengines.",

      "abstract": "Universal adversarial perturbation attacks are widely used to analyze image\nclassifiers that employ convolutional neural networks. Nowadays, some attacks\ncan deceive image- and video-quality metrics. So sustainability analysis of\nthese metrics is important. Indeed, if an attack can confuse the metric, an\nattacker can easily increase quality scores. When developers of image- and\nvideo-algorithms can boost their scores through detached processing, algorithm\ncomparisons are no longer fair. Inspired by the idea of universal adversarial\nperturbation for classifiers, we suggest a new method to attack differentiable\nno-reference quality metrics through universal perturbation. We applied this\nmethod to seven no-reference image- and video-quality metrics (PaQ-2-PiQ,\nLinearity, VSFA, MDTVSFA, KonCept512, Nima and SPAQ). For each one, we trained\na universal perturbation that increases the respective scores. We also propose\na method for assessing metric stability and identify the metrics that are the\nmost vulnerable and the most resistant to our attack. The existence of\nsuccessful universal perturbations appears to diminish the metric's ability to\nprovide reliable scores. We therefore recommend our proposed method as an\nadditional verification of metric reliability to complement traditional\nsubjective tests and benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Cloud computing has made federated database systems (FDBS) significantly more\npractical to implement than in the past. As part of a recent Web-based\nGeographic Information System (WebGIS) project, we are employing cloud-native\ntechnologies (from the container ecosystem) to develop a federated database\n(DB) infrastructure, to help manage and utilise the distributed and various\ngeospatial data. Unfortunately, there seem to be inherent challenges and\ncomplexity of applying the container and Kubernetes technologies to building\nand running DB systems. Considering that most of the geospatial and theme data\nare pre-obtained and fixed in our WebGIS project, we decided to focus on the\nread-only user queries and still resort to Kubernetes to implement an FDBS\ninstance to use. Unlike the de facto practices (e.g., using the StatefulSets\nmechanism, extending Kuberentes APIs, or employing KubeFed), our solution for\nKubernetes-aided FDBS simplifies the tech stack by investigating the fractal\nobject of federated data management, inclusively containerising DB instances,\nand using the lightweight Deployment mechanism to handle stateless DB\ncontainers. Overall, this research not only reveals an easy-to-implement\napproach to constructing read-only components in a fully-fledged FDBS, but also\nproposes and demonstrates a novel methodology for FDBS investigations.",

In the FSO channel,\natmospheric turbulence (AT) degrades the signal. In this study, we combined the\nparameters of the digital drone camera and the optical channel to mitigate the\nAT effect. The digital drone camera parameters are indicated by the field of\nview and camera object distance to support this proposal. Meanwhile, the\noptical channel parameters, rather than the altitude, are denoted by the most\ncritical parameter, which is the refractive index structure parameter used to\ncharacterize the effects of AT. Consequently, two lemmas are proposed and\ncombined to present the optimum relationship between the digital drone camera\nand optical channel parameters. Therefore, the quality of the entire air\nsurveillance system with a digital drone camera FSO is significantly improved.\nFurthermore, the analysis and optimization for practical cases were applied to\nsupport our findings. Finally, our results demonstrated that an impressive\nperformance improvement of an air surveillance system of 17 dB is possible\ncompared without optimization by combining digital drone camera and FSO\nparameters at a target outage transceiver probability of $10^-6$.",

Both part segmentation and structure\ninference have been extensively studied in the recent deep learning literature,\nwhile the supervisions used for each task have not been fully exploited to\nassist the other task. Namely, structure inference has been typically conducted\nwith an autoencoder that does not leverage the point-to-part associations.\nAlso, segmentation has been mostly performed without structural priors that\ntell the plausibility of the output segments. We present how these two tasks\ncan be best combined while fully utilizing supervision to improve performance.\nOur framework first decomposes a raw input shape into part segments using an\noff-the-shelf algorithm, whose outputs are then mapped to nodes in a part\nhierarchy, establishing point-to-part associations. Following this, ours\npredicts the structural information, e.g., part bounding boxes and part\nrelationships. Lastly, the segmentation is rectified by examining the confusion\nof part boundaries using the structure-based part features. Our experimental\nresults based on the StructureNet and PartNet demonstrate that the interplay\nbetween the two tasks results in remarkable improvements in both tasks: 27.91%\nin structure inference and 0.5% in segmentation.",

Treatments are delivered by simulation on a\ncontinuous sequence of synthetic CTs generated from real MRI sequences. During\ntreatment, the plans for which the tumor is at a close distance to the current\ntumor position are selected to deliver their spots. The study is conducted on\nfive liver cases. Results: We tested our approach under imperfect knowledge of\nthe tumor positions with a 2 mm distance error. On average, compared to a 4D\nrobustly optimized treatment plan, our approach led to a dose homogeneity\nincrease of 5% (defined as 1-(D_5-D_95)/prescription) in the target and a mean\nliver dose decrease of 23. The treatment time was roughly increased by a factor\nof 2 but remained below 4 minutes on average. Conclusions: Our image-guided\ntreatment framework outperforms state-of-the-art 4D-robust plans for all\npatients in this study on both target coverage and OARs sparing, with an\nacceptable increase in treatment time under the current accuracy of tumor\ntracking technology.",

Two essential communications in\nsuch vehicles are central control connection and real-time dispatching, also an\noptional data connection for passengers is welcome. The high mobility of\nHyperloop imposes a severe impact on the performance of wireless communication\nlinks. Therefore, designing a new wireless communication system is necessary to\ncope with the challenges. Motivated by the importance of doppler spreading,\nthis paper focuses on the characterizations of the wireless channel in\nHyperloop and then analyzes the performance degradation of the radio link.\nAfterward, a comprehensive overview of the present railway communication\ntechnologies as potential solutions for the Hyperloop project and a detailed\ndiscussion of their cons and pros are provided. It is shown that current\ncommunication technologies are not satisfactory for this scenario. Finally,\nthis paper concludes the key points that need to be considered in future\nrailway communications systems in order to overcome the Hyperloop communication\nchallenges. So, we open up a new issue that Hyperloop communications require\ndesigning a novel method or improving the existing technologies or a\ncombination of different techniques (some of these techniques are mentioned).",

      "abstract": "In recent decades, large-scale sky surveys such as Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) have resulted in generation of tremendous amount of data. The\nclassification of this enormous amount of data by astronomers is time\nconsuming. To simplify this process, in 2007 a volunteer-based citizen science\nproject called Galaxy Zoo was introduced, which has reduced the time for\nclassification by a good extent. However, in this modern era of deep learning,\nautomating this classification task is highly beneficial as it reduces the time\nfor classification. For the last few years, many algorithms have been proposed\nwhich happen to do a phenomenal job in classifying galaxies into multiple\nclasses. But all these algorithms tend to classify galaxies into less than six\nclasses. However, after considering the minute information which we know about\ngalaxies, it is necessary to classify galaxies into more than eight classes. In\nthis study, a neural network model is proposed so as to classify SDSS data into\n10 classes from an extended Hubble Tuning Fork. Great care is given to disc\nedge and disc face galaxies, distinguishing between a variety of substructures\nand minute features which are associated with each class. The proposed model\nconsists of convolution layers to extract features making this method fully\nautomatic. The achieved test accuracy is 84.73 per cent which happens to be\npromising after considering such minute details in classes. Along with\nconvolution layers, the proposed model has three more layers responsible for\nclassification, which makes the algorithm consume less time.",

      "abstract": "The recent experimental verification of the charge-transfer superexchange\nmechanism as the microscopic pairing mechanism of high-$T_c$ cuprate\nsuperconductivity by Seamus Davis and collaborators\\cite{sea} is a tour de\nforce! The correct model for cuprates is the three band Emery model in which\noxygen p-orbitals are explicitly taken into account. The doped holes go into\nthese oxygen p-orbitals where they undergo charge-transfer superexchange with\nunpaired electrons in copper d orbitals. This charge transfer superexchange is\nthe key which leads to bound pairs and superconductivity. In the experimental\nverification\\cite{sea}, the system chosen is $Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x}$. What is\nachieved is the direct functional dependence of the local electron pair density\n($n_P(r)$) on local charge transfer energy ($\\ep_{pd}(r)$) using state of the\nart single-electron and electron-pair (Josephson) scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy. The quantitative functional dependence of $n_P(r)$ on $\\ep_{pd}(r)$\nmatches with that indicated and deduced by\ntheory\\cite{t1,t2,t3,t4,t5,t6,t7,t8,t9,t10}. The verdict of the experiment\nsettles the debates on the microscopic mechanisms of the cuprate\nsuperconductivity in the clear favor of charge-transfer superexchange\nmechanism. We discuss this development in brief, and present a simple minded\napproach to the essence of cuprate superconductivity. We discuss what is\nsettled now, and what is not settled yet.

      "title": "Chemical Evolution of Fluorine in the Milky Way",
      "abstract": "Fluorine has many different potential sites and channels of production,\nmaking narrowing down a dominant site of fluorine production particularly\nchallenging. In this work, we investigate which sources are the dominant\ncontributors to the galactic fluorine by comparing chemical evolution models to\nobservations of fluorine abundances in Milky Way stars covering a metallicity\nrange -2$<$[Fe/H]$<$0.4 and upper limits in the range -3.4$<$[Fe/H]$<$-2.3. In\nour models, we use a variety of stellar yield sets in order to explore the\nimpact of varying both AGB and massive star yields on the chemical evolution of\nfluorine. In particular, we investigate different prescriptions for initial\nrotational velocity in massive stars as well as a metallicity dependent mix of\nrotational velocities. We find that the observed [F/O] and [F/Fe] abundance\nratios at low metallicity and the increasing trend of [F/Ba] at\n[Fe/H]$\\gtrsim$-1 can only be reproduced by chemical evolution models assuming,\nat all metallicities, a contribution from rapidly rotating massive stars with\ninitial rotational velocities as high as 300km s$^{-1}$. A mix of rotational\nvelocities may provide a more physical solution than the sole use of massive\nstars with $v_{\\text{rot}}$=300$\\text{km s}^{-1}$, which are predicted to\noverestimate the fluorine and average s-process elemental abundances at\n[Fe/H]$\\gtrsim$-1. The contribution from AGB stars is predicted to start at\n[Fe/H]$\\approx$-1 and becomes increasingly important at high metallicity, being\nstrictly coupled to the evolution of the nitrogen abundance. Finally, by using\nmodern yield sets, we investigate the fluorine abundances of Wolf-Rayet winds,\nruling them out as dominant contributors to the galactic fluorine.",

We find out that for the small value\nof inter-species coupling strength the BEC starts to oscillate inside the trap.\nFor mild coupling strengths, attractive and repulsive impurities are captured\nafter a few cycles of oscillation inside the BEC. In the strong interaction\nstrength regime, the to-and-fro motion of impurities is suppressed quite fast.\nOur conclusion indicates that quench dynamics can be a tool for studying\nimpurity BEC interactions or impurity-impurity interactions.

      "abstract": "Integrative analysis of datasets generated by multiple cohorts is a\nwidely-used approach for increasing sample size, precision of population\nestimators, and generalizability of analysis results in epidemiological\nstudies. However, often each individual cohort dataset does not have all\nvariables of interest for an integrative analysis collected as a part of an\noriginal study. Such cohort-level missingness poses methodological challenges\nto the integrative analysis since missing variables have traditionally: (1)\nbeen removed from the data for complete case analysis; or (2) been completed by\nmissing data interpolation techniques using data with the same covariate\ndistribution from other studies. In most integrative-analysis studies, neither\napproach is optimal as it leads to either loosing the majority of study\ncovariates or challenges in specifying the cohorts following the same\ndistributions. We propose a novel approach to identify the studies with same\ndistributions that could be used for completing the cohort-level missing\ninformation. Our methodology relies on (1) identifying sub-groups of cohorts\nwith similar covariate distributions using cohort identity random forest\nprediction models followed by clustering; and then (2) applying a recursive\npairwise distribution test for high dimensional data to these sub-groups.\nExtensive simulation studies show that cohorts with the same distribution are\ncorrectly grouped together in almost all simulation settings. Our methods'\napplication to two ECHO-wide Cohort Studies reveals that the cohorts grouped\ntogether reflect the similarities in study design.

In PE-EMIS, the rectangular\nparallelepiped quartz sample with two small partial electrodes fabricated on a\ncorner is self-excited/sensed. The conductance spectrum (equivalent to the\nresonance spectrum) measured by an impedance analyzer under a true free\nboundary condition is noiseless, allowing the first 100 eigenmodes ranging from\n50 to 310kHz to be accurately fitted. To avoid mode misidentification, the\noff-plane displacement distributions of the quartz sample under different\neigenmodes are determined using a scanned-laser vibrometer. The resonance\nspectrum measured using a commercial sandwich-like RUS apparatus is also\npresented for comparison, and the results show that the clamping force in\nsandwich-like RUS shifts the sample's resonance frequencies, causing 13% and\n75% overestimations for the piezoelectric coefficients e11 and e14,\nrespectively.

      "abstract": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) promise to revolutionize how content creators\n(e.g., artists) price and sell their work. One core feature of NFTs is the\noption to embed creator royalties which earmark a percentage of future sale\nproceeds to creators, each time their NFTs change hands. As popular as this\nfeature is in practice, its utility is often questioned because buyers, the\nargument goes, simply ``price it in at the time of purchase''. As intuitive as\nthis argument sounds, it is incomplete. We find royalties can add value to\ncreators in at least three distinct ways. (i) Risk sharing: when creators and\nbuyers are risk sensitive, royalties can improve trade by splitting the risks\nassociated with future price volatility; (ii) Dynamic pricing: in the presence\nof information asymmetry, royalties can extract more revenues from\nbetter-informed speculators over time, mimicking the benefits of ``dynamic\npricing''; (iii) Price discrimination: when creators sell multi-unit NFT\ncollections, royalties can better capture value from heterogeneous buyers.

We show that the algorithm mixes in time\n$\\tilde{O}(n^2/ \\psi_n^2)$, where $\\psi_n$ is the smallest isoperimetric\nconstant for any isotropic logconcave distribution, also known as the\nKannan-Lovasz-Simonovits (KLS) constant. Our bound improves upon previous\nbounds of the form $\\tilde{O}(n^2 R^2/r^2)$, which depend on the ratio $R/r$ of\nthe radii of the circumscribed and inscribed balls of $K$, gaining a factor of\n$n$ in the case of isotropic convex bodies. Consequently, our result gives a\nmixing time estimate for the hit-and-run which matches the state-of-the-art\nbounds for the ball walk. Our main proof technique is based on an annealing of\nlocalization schemes introduced in Chen and Eldan (2022), which allows us to\nreduce the problem to the analysis of the mixing time on truncated Gaussian\ndistributions.",

Therefore, it is challenging to understand deaf individuals,\neven proficient sign language users, resulting in a barrier between the deaf\ncommunity and the rest of society. To bridge this language barrier, we propose\na novel multilingual communication system, namely MUGCAT, to improve the\ncommunication efficiency of sign language users. By converting recognized\nspecific hand gestures into expressive pictures, which is universal usage and\nlanguage independence, our MUGCAT system significantly helps deaf people convey\ntheir thoughts. To overcome the limitation of sign language usage, which is\nmostly impossible to translate into complete sentences for ordinary people, we\npropose to reconstruct meaningful sentences from the incomplete translation of\nsign language. We also measure the semantic similarity of generated sentences\nwith fragmented recognized hand gestures to keep the original meaning.\nExperimental results show that the proposed system can work in a real-time\nmanner and synthesize exquisite stunning illustrations and meaningful sentences\nfrom a few hand gestures of sign language. This proves that our MUGCAT has\npromising potential in assisting deaf communication.",

In this work, we generalize previous efforts by extending the\ntarget matrix from zero to any matrix that admits efficient matrix-vector\nproducts. The proposed paradigm allows us to construct novel regularization\nterms that enforce symmetry or diagonality on square Jacobian and Hessian\nmatrices. On the other hand, the major challenge for Jacobian and Hessian\nregularization has been high computational complexity. We introduce\nLanczos-based spectral norm minimization to tackle this difficulty. This\ntechnique uses a parallelized implementation of the Lanczos algorithm and is\ncapable of effective and stable regularization of large Jacobian and Hessian\nmatrices. Theoretical justifications and empirical evidence are provided for\nthe proposed paradigm and technique. We carry out exploratory experiments to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our novel regularization terms. We also conduct\ncomparative experiments to evaluate Lanczos-based spectral norm minimization\nagainst prior methods. Results show that the proposed methodologies are\nadvantageous for a wide range of tasks.",

However, there are other\ndescriptions where the origin of gravity can be understood through torsion and\nnon-metricity $Q$. In this work, we discuss a modified theory of gravity namely\n$f(Q)$ gravity, which considers a non-linear extension of $Q$. In particular,\nwe study the case where it is non-minimally coupled to matter. Motivated by the\nrecent success of Chaplygin gas models in the explanation of dark energy, we\nassume a pressureless baryonic matter and a generalized Chaplygin gas as the\nbackground fluid. We constrain the proposed model using two different datasets:\none for Hubble measurements and the other for quasars (which we calibrated)\nwith Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We employ kinematic tools such as\ndeceleration and jerk parameters to determine deviations of the proposed model\nfrom $\\Lambda$CDM. We establish that the transition redshift $z_T$ in the\ndeceleration parameter $q$ is $0.607$ and $0.204$ with the two datasets\nrespectively, therefore describing the universe's acceleration.",

Firstly, some different feature types,\nsuch as the time domain (TD) features and the frequency domain (FD) features,\ncan be extracted from a speaker's speech, and the TD and the FD features can be\nconsidered as the linear mixtures of independent feature components (IFCs) with\nan unknown mixing system. To estimate the IFCs, the TD and the FD features of\nthe speaker's speech are concatenated to build the TD and the FD feature\nmatrix, respectively. Then, a feature tensor of the speaker's speech is\nobtained by paralleling the TD and the FD feature matrix. To enhance the\ndependence on different feature types and remove the redundancies of the same\nfeature type, the independent vector analysis (IVA) can be used to estimate the\nIFC matrices of TD and FD features with the feature tensor. The IFC matrices\nare utilized as the input of the PCNN to extract the deep features of the TD\nand FD features, respectively. The deep features can be integrated to obtain\nthe fusion feature of the speaker's speech. Finally, the fusion feature of the\nspeaker's speech is employed as the input of a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork (DCNN) classifier for speaker recognition.

As a consequence,\n6G will be much more complex than its predecessors. The growth of the system\nscale and complexity as well as the coexistence with the legacy networks and\nthe diversified service requirements will inevitably incur huge maintenance\ncost and efforts for future 6G networks. Network Root Cause Analysis (Net-RCA)\nplays a critical role in identifying root causes of network faults. In this\narticle, we first give an introduction about the envisioned 6G networks. Next,\nwe discuss the challenges and potential solutions of 6G network operation and\nmanagement, and comprehensively survey existing RCA methods. Then we propose an\nartificial intelligence (AI)-empowered Net-RCA framework for 6G. Performance\ncomparisons on both synthetic and real-world network data are carried out to\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing method\nconsiderably.",

      "abstract": "Capacity constrained optimal transport is a variant of optimal transport,\nwhich adds extra constraints on the set of feasible couplings in the original\noptimal transport problem to limit the mass transported between each pair of\nsource and sink. Based on this setting, constrained optimal transport has\nnumerous applications, e.g., finance, network flow. However, due to the large\nnumber of constraints in this problem, existing algorithms are both\ntime-consuming and space-consuming. In this paper, inspired by entropic\nregularization for the classical optimal transport problem, we introduce a\nnovel regularization term for capacity constrained optimal transport. The\nregularized problem naturally satisfies the capacity constraints and\nconsequently makes it possible to analyze the duality. Unlike the matrix-vector\nmultiplication in the alternate iteration scheme for solving classical optimal\ntransport, in our algorithm, each alternate iteration step is to solve several\nsingle-variable equations. Fortunately, we find that each of these equations\ncorresponds to a single-variable monotonic function, and we convert solving\nthese equations into finding the unique zero point of each single-variable\nmonotonic function with Newton's method. Extensive numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that our proposed method has a significant advantage in terms of\naccuracy, efficiency, and memory consumption compared with existing methods.",

      "abstract": "3D reconstruction from videos has become increasingly popular for various\napplications, including navigation for autonomous driving of robots and drones,\naugmented reality (AR), and 3D modeling. This task often combines traditional\nimage/video processing algorithms and deep neural networks (DNNs). Although\nrecent developments in deep learning have improved the accuracy of the task,\nthe large number of calculations involved results in low computation speed and\nhigh power consumption. Although there are various domain-specific hardware\naccelerators for DNNs, it is not easy to accelerate the entire process of\napplications that alternate between traditional image/video processing\nalgorithms and DNNs. Thus, FPGA-based end-to-end acceleration is required for\nsuch complicated applications in low-power embedded environments.\n  This paper proposes a novel FPGA-based accelerator for DeepVideoMVS, a\nDNN-based depth estimation method for 3D reconstruction. We employ HW/SW\nco-design to appropriately utilize heterogeneous components in modern SoC\nFPGAs, such as programmable logic (PL) and CPU, according to the inherent\ncharacteristics of the method. As some operations are unsuitable for hardware\nimplementation, we determine the operations to be implemented in software\nthrough analyzing the number of times each operation is performed and its\nmemory access pattern, and then considering comprehensive aspects: the ease of\nhardware implementation and degree of expected acceleration by hardware. The\nhardware and software implementations are executed in parallel on the PL and\nCPU to hide their execution latencies. The proposed accelerator was developed\non a Xilinx ZCU104 board by using NNgen, an open-source high-level synthesis\n(HLS) tool. Experiments showed that the proposed accelerator operates 60.2\ntimes faster than the software-only implementation on the same FPGA board with\nminimal accuracy degradation.",

      "abstract": "Recent findings of large anomalous Hall signal in nonferromagnetic and\nnonferrimagnetic materials suggest that the magnetization of the system is not\na critical component for the realization of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE).\nHere, we present a combined theoretical and experimental study demonstrating\nthe evolution of different mechanisms of AHE in a cubic Heusler system\nMnPt$_{1-x}$Ir$_x$Sn. With the help of magnetization and neutron diffraction\nstudies, we show that the substitution of nonmagnetic Ir in place of Pt\nsignificantly reduces the net magnetic moment from 4.17 $ \\mu _B$/f.u. in\nMnPtSn to 2.78 $ \\mu _B$/f.u. for MnPt$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn. In contrast, the\nanomalous Hall resistivity is enhanced by nearly three times from 1.6 $ \\mu\n\\Omega $ cm in MnPtSn to about 5 $ \\mu \\Omega $ cm for\nMnPt$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn. The power law analysis of the Hall resistivity data\nsuggests that the extrinsic contribution of AHE that dominates in the case of\nthe parent MnPtSn almost vanishes for MnPt$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn, where the\nintrinsic mechanism plays the major role. The experimental results are well\nsupported by our theoretical study, which shows a considerable enhancement of\nthe spin-orbit coupling when Ir is introduced into the system. Our finding of a\ncrossover of the anomalous Hall effect with chemical engineering is a major\ncontribution toward the recent interest in controlling the band topology of\ntopological materials, both in bulk and thin-film forms.",

      "abstract": "Stability under model predictive control (MPC) schemes is frequently ensured\nby terminal ingredients. Employing a (control) Lyapunov function as the\nterminal cost constitutes a common choice. Learning-based methods may be used\nto construct the terminal cost by relating it to, for instance, an\ninfinite-horizon optimal control problem in which the optimal cost is a\nLyapunov function. Value iteration, an approximate dynamic programming (ADP)\napproach, refers to one particular cost approximation technique. In this work,\nwe merge the results of terminally unconstrained predictive control and\napproximate value iteration to draw benefits from both fields. A prediction\nhorizon is derived in dependence on different factors such as\napproximation-related errors to render the closed-loop asymptotically stable\nfurther allowing a suboptimality estimate in comparison to an infinite horizon\noptimal cost. The result extends recent studies on predictive control with\nADP-based terminal costs, not requiring a local initial stabilizing controller.\nWe compare this controller in simulation with other terminal cost options to\nshow that the proposed approach leads to a shorter minimal horizon in\ncomparison to previous results.",

      "abstract": "Radiative transfer plays a major role in high-energy astrophysics. In\nmultiple scenarios and in a broad range of energy scales, the coupling between\nmatter and radiation is essential to understand the interplay between theory,\nobservations and numerical simulations. In this paper, we present a novel\nscheme for solving the equations of radiation relativistic magnetohydrodynamics\nwithin the parallel code L\\'ostrego. These equations, which are formulated\ntaking successive moments of the Boltzmann radiative transfer equation, are\nsolved under the gray-body approximation and the M1 closure using an IMEX time\nintegration scheme. The main novelty of our scheme is that we introduce for the\nfirst time in the context of radiation magnetohydrodynamics a family of\nJacobian-free Riemann solvers based on internal approximations to the\nPolynomial Viscosity Matrix, which were demonstrated to be robust and accurate\nfor non-radiative applications. The robustness and the limitations of the new\nalgorithms are tested by solving a collection of one-dimensional and\nmulti-dimensional test problems, both in the free-streaming and in the\ndiffusion radiation transport limits. Due to its stable performance, the\napplicability of the scheme presented in this paper to real astrophysical\nscenarios in high-energy astrophysics is promising. In future simulations, we\nexpect to be able to explore the dynamical relevance of photon-matter\ninteractions in the context of relativistic jets and accretion discs, from\nmicroquasars and AGN to gamma-ray bursts.",

      "title": "Domain Adaptive Scene Text Detection via Subcategorization",
      "abstract": "Most existing scene text detectors require large-scale training data which\ncannot scale well due to two major factors: 1) scene text images often have\ndomain-specific distributions; 2) collecting large-scale annotated scene text\nimages is laborious. We study domain adaptive scene text detection, a largely\nneglected yet very meaningful task that aims for optimal transfer of labelled\nscene text images while handling unlabelled images in various new domains.\nSpecifically, we design SCAST, a subcategory-aware self-training technique that\nmitigates the network overfitting and noisy pseudo labels in domain adaptive\nscene text detection effectively. SCAST consists of two novel designs. For\nlabelled source data, it introduces pseudo subcategories for both foreground\ntexts and background stuff which helps train more generalizable source models\nwith multi-class detection objectives. For unlabelled target data, it mitigates\nthe network overfitting by co-regularizing the binary and subcategory\nclassifiers trained in the source domain. Extensive experiments show that SCAST\nachieves superior detection performance consistently across multiple public\nbenchmarks, and it also generalizes well to other domain adaptive detection\ntasks such as vehicle detection.",

      "abstract": "Magnetoacoustic waves in solar magnetic flux tubes may be affected by the\npresence of background rotational flows. Here, we investigate the behaviour of\n$m=0$ and $m=\\pm 1$ modes of a magnetic flux tube in the presence of linear\nbackground rotational flows embedded in a photospheric environment. We show\nthat the inclusion of a background rotational flow is found to have little\neffect on the obtained eigensolutions for the axisymmetric $m=0$ sausage mode.\nHowever, solutions for the kink mode are dependent on the location of the flow\nresonance modified by the slow frequency. A background rotational flow causes\nthe modified flow resonances to possess faster phase speeds in the thin-tube\n(TT) limit for the case $m=1$. This results in solutions for the slow body and\nslow surface kink modes to follow this trajectory, changing their dispersive\nbehaviour. For a photospheric flux tube in the TT limit, we show that it\nbecomes difficult to distinguish between the slow surface and fast surface kink\n($m=1$) modes upon comparison of their eigenfunctions. 2D velocity field plots\ndemonstrate how these waves, in the presence of background rotational flows,\nmay appear in observational data. For slow body kink modes, a swirling pattern\ncan be seen in the total pressure perturbation. Furthermore, the tube boundary\nundergoes a helical motion from the breaking of azimuthal symmetry, where the\n$m=1$ and $m=-1$ modes become out of phase, suggesting the resulting kink wave\nis circularly polarised. These results may have implications for seismology of\nmagnetohydrodynamic waves in solar magnetic vortices.",

A concrete construction based on\nstructure-preserving signatures and NIWI proofs is proposed and a detailed\nsecurity and privacy analysis proves that SPOT is secure under standard\nassumptions.

The anomaly\nfree flavor-chiral fermion representation is then constructed, solely out of\nthrees and without any superfluous replication, by treating each standard\n$V$-triplet (and anti triplet) as an $H$-singlet, and conversely, by letting\neach standard $V$-singlet transform as an $H$-triplet (or anti triplet). The\nmodel can be schematically described by a tetrahedron of flavors. In its\nbi-trinification phase, the model exhibits two coupled trinification cycles,\nsharing the same color group, and is furthermore accompanied by a built-in dark\nsector. In its isomorphic quartification phase, the model presents a novel\nnon-Pati-Salam version of quark/lepton correspondence, where quarks are paired\nwith anti-leptons to cancel horizontal anomalies, and all fermion masses stem\nfrom one and the same Yukawa source.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a technique to train a robot to perform kick-motion in AI\nsoccer by using reinforcement learning (RL). In RL, an agent interacts with an\nenvironment and learns to choose an action in a state at each step. When\ntraining RL algorithms, a problem called the curse of dimensionality (COD) can\noccur if the dimension of the state is high and the number of training data is\nlow. The COD often causes degraded performance of RL models. In the situation\nof the robot kicking the ball, as the ball approaches the robot, the robot\nchooses the action based on the information obtained from the soccer field. In\norder not to suffer COD, the training data, which are experiences in the case\nof RL, should be collected evenly from all areas of the soccer field over\n(theoretically infinite) time. In this paper, we attempt to use the relative\ncoordinate system (RCS) as the state for training kick-motion of robot agent,\ninstead of using the absolute coordinate system (ACS). Using the RCS eliminates\nthe necessity for the agent to know all the (state) information of entire\nsoccer field and reduces the dimension of the state that the agent needs to\nknow to perform kick-motion, and consequently alleviates COD. The training\nbased on the RCS is performed with the widely used Deep Q-network (DQN) and\ntested in the AI Soccer environment implemented with Webots simulation\nsoftware.",

We then\ntransform this problem into a finite-dimensional optimization one by utilizing\na disturbance feedback policy parametrization for covariance steering and a\ntractable approximation of the safety constraints. To solve the latter problem,\nwe derive a decentralized consensus-based algorithm using the Alternating\nDirection Method of Multipliers (ADMM). This method is then extended to a\nreceding horizon form, which yields the proposed DMPCS algorithm. Simulation\nexperiments on large-scale problems with up to hundreds of robots successfully\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of DMPCS. Its superior capability\nin achieving safety is also highlighted through a comparison against a standard\nstochastic MPC approach.

      "title": "Rethinking Two Consensuses of the Transferability in Deep Learning",
      "abstract": "Deep transfer learning (DTL) has formed a long-term quest toward enabling\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) to reuse historical experiences as efficiently as\nhumans. This ability is named knowledge transferability. A commonly used\nparadigm for DTL is firstly learning general knowledge (pre-training) and then\nreusing (fine-tuning) them for a specific target task. There are two\nconsensuses of transferability of pre-trained DNNs: (1) a larger domain gap\nbetween pre-training and downstream data brings lower transferability; (2) the\ntransferability gradually decreases from lower layers (near input) to higher\nlayers (near output). However, these consensuses were basically drawn from the\nexperiments based on natural images, which limits their scope of application.\nThis work aims to study and complement them from a broader perspective by\nproposing a method to measure the transferability of pre-trained DNN\nparameters. Our experiments on twelve diverse image classification datasets get\nsimilar conclusions to the previous consensuses. More importantly, two new\nfindings are presented, i.e., (1) in addition to the domain gap, a larger data\namount and huge dataset diversity of downstream target task also prohibit the\ntransferability; (2) although the lower layers learn basic image features, they\nare usually not the most transferable layers due to their domain sensitivity.",

Here we present a sample of the 12 novae with the most\ndetailed ultraviolet (UV) follow-up by Swift -- the first uniform analysis of\nsuch UV light-curves. The fading of these specific light-curves can be modelled\nas power-law decays (plotting magnitude against log time), showing that the\nsame physical processes dominate the UV emission for extended time intervals in\nindividual objects. After the end of the nuclear burning interval, the X-ray\nemission drops significantly, fading by a factor of around 10-100. The UV\nchanges, however, are of a lower amplitude, declining by 1-2 mag over the same\ntime period. The UV light-curves typically show a break from flatter to steeper\naround the time at which the X-ray light-curve starts a steady decline from\nmaximum, ~0.7-1.3 T_SSSend. Considering populations of both classical and\nrecurrent novae, and those with main sequence or giant companions, we do not\nfind any strong differences in the UV light-curves or their evolution, although\nthe long-period recurrent novae are more luminous than the majority of the\nclassical novae.",

      "abstract": "In 1995 I wrote a paper: \"A Speed Limit for Evolution\" whose main result was\nthat evolution must proceed rather slowly, in accordance with the earlier views\nand intuitions of many authors. The abstract of the paper said: \"The genetic\ninformation expressed in some part of the phenotype of a species cannot\nincrease faster than a given rate, determined by the selection pressure on that\npart. This rate is typically a small fraction of a bit per generation\". This\nresult was derived in the presence of sexual reproduction and other effects\nsuch as temporarily isolated sub-populations. In 1999 David Mackay published a\npaper which apparently contradicted this result. In the abstract, he wrote \"We\nfind striking differences between populations that have recombination and\npopulations that do not. If variation is produced by mutation alone, then the\nentire population gains up to roughly 1 bit per generation. If variation is\ncreated by recombination, the population can gain of the order of sqrt(G) bits\nper generation.\" Mackay proposed that there were outstanding evolutionary\nbenefits to sexual reproduction, and that my result was too low by a very large\nfactor. He later repeated this result in a textbook he wrote in 2003. The\npurpose of this note is to show that the key assumption of Mackays model, that\n\"fitness is a strictly additive trait\" is so unrealistic as to render his\nresults irrelevant to any actual life form. In consequence, the speed limit I\nderived is still valid, and has important consequences for human cognitive\nevolution.",

The\nintroduced micromechanical approach modifies the Morphologically Representative\nPattern scheme with the Replacement Mori-Tanaka Model.

Four shapes of\ninhomogeneities are studied: a sphere, a prolate spheroid, three prolate\nspheroids crossing at right angles, and a drilled spheroid. The concentration\ntensors of non-ellipsoidal inhomogeneities are found numerically using simple\nsimulations of a single particle. The extension to the regime of non-linear\nmaterial behaviour is performed by employing the tangent or secant incremental\nlinearization of the material response. The results are compared with the\noutcomes of numerical simulations and predictions of the classical mean-field\nmodels based on the Eshelby solution, e.g., the Mori-Tanaka model or the\nSelf-Consistent scheme.

There are several potential sources of errors and quantifying each one\naccurately is essential. This paper addresses one source of uncertainty\nrelating to measuring the fine structure constant on white dwarf surfaces.\nDetailed modelling of photospheric absorption lines requires knowing the\nunderlying spectral continuum level. Here we describe the development of a\nfully automated, objective, and reproducible continuum estimation method, based\non fitting cubic splines to carefully selected data regions. Example fits to\nthe Hubble Space Telescope spectrum of the white dwarf G191-B2B are given. We\ncarry out measurements of the fine structure constant using two continuum\nmodels. The results show that continuum placement variations result in small\nsystematic shifts in the centroids of narrow photospheric absorption lines\nwhich impact significantly on fine structure constant measurements. This effect\nmust therefore be included in the overall error budget of future measurements.\nOur results also suggest that continuum placement variations should be\ninvestigated in other contexts, including fine structure constant measurements\nin stars other than white dwarfs, quasar absorption line measurements of the\nfine structure constant, and quasar measurements of cosmological redshift\ndrift.",

To address these issues, our method uses an analysis by synthesis\napproach, combining a conditional NeRF with a viewpoint predictor and a scene\nencoder in order to produce self-supervised reconstructions for whole object\ncategories. Rather than focusing on high fidelity reconstruction, we target\nefficient and accurate viewpoint prediction in complex scenarios, e.g.\n360{\\deg} rotation on real data.

A major goal is to obtain\nanalogues of the work of Moore \\& Peterson and Margolis on \\emph{nearly\nFrobenius algebras} and \\emph{$P$-algebras} which was applied to graded Hopf\nalgebras such as the Steenrod algebra for a prime. Such locally Frobenius\nalgebras are coherent and in studying their modules we are naturally led to\nfocus on coherent and finite dimensional modules. Indeed, the category of\ncoherent modules over locally Frobenius algebra $A$ is abelian with enough\nprojectives and injectives since $A$ is injective relative to the coherent\nmodules; however it only has finite limits and colimits. The finite dimensional\nmodules also form an abelian category but finite dimensional modules are never\ncoherent. The minimal ideals of a locally Frobenius algebra are precisely the\nones which are isomorphic to coherent simple modules; in particular it does not\ncontain a copy of any finite dimensional simple module so it is not a Kasch\nalgebra. We discuss possible versions of stable module categories for such\nalgebras. We also discuss possible monoidal structures on module categories of\na locally Frobenius Hopf algebra: for example tensor products of coherent\nmodules turn out to be pseudo-coherent. Examples of locally Frobenius Hopf\nalgebras include group algebras of locally finite groups, already intensively\nstudied in the literature.",

In this\nwork, we investigate the quasi-static and dynamic behaviour of cellular\nmaterials manufactured from 316L stainless steel using laser powder bed fusion\n(LPBF). Four cellular architectures are considered (octet lattice,\nlattice-walled square honeycomb, origami and square honeycomb), as well as\nthree sets of AM process parameters, characterised by laser powers of 50, 125\nand 200 W. The exposure time is adjusted to deliver the same total heat input.\nThe 125 W case leads to material with the highest strength and ductility. The\ncellular materials with this process variant match their nominal densities most\nclosely, and have the highest strength and energy absorption. Either reducing\n(50 W) or increasing (200 W) the power leads to a significant increase in\nporosity, reducing strength and energy absorption.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel 3D object detection architecture, which can encode\nLiDAR point cloud sequences acquired by multiple successive scans. The encoding\nprocess of the point cloud sequence is performed on two different time scales.\nWe first design a short-term motion-aware voxel encoding that captures the\nshort-term temporal changes of point clouds driven by the motion of objects in\neach voxel. We also propose long-term motion-guided bird's eye view (BEV)\nfeature enhancement that adaptively aligns and aggregates the BEV feature maps\nobtained by the short-term voxel encoding by utilizing the dynamic motion\ncontext inferred from the sequence of the feature maps. The experiments\nconducted on the public nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that the proposed 3D\nobject detector offers significant improvements in performance compared to the\nbaseline methods and that it sets a state-of-the-art performance for certain 3D\nobject detection categories.
