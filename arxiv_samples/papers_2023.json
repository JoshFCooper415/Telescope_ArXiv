      "title": "Fibrous thermoresponsive Janus membranes for directional vapor transport",
      "abstract": "Wearing comfort of apparel is highly dependent on moisture management and\nrespective transport properties of the textiles. In today's used textiles, the\nwater vapor transmission (WVT) depends primarily on the porosity and the\nwettability of the clothing layer next to the skin and is not adapting or\nresponsive on environmental conditions. The WVT is inevitably the same from\nboth sides of the membrane. In this study, we propose a novel approach by\ndevelopment of a thermoresponsive Janus membrane using electrospinning\nprocedures. We, therefore, targeted a membrane as a bilayer composite structure\nby use of PVDF as one layer and a blend of PVDF and PNIPAM as the second layer\nchanging wettability properties in the range of physiological temperatures.\nTailored electrospinning conditions led to a self-standing membrane\nincorporating fiber diameters of 400nm, porosities of 50% for both layers\nwithin the Janus membrane. The WVT studies revealed that the combined effects\nof the Janus membrane's directional wettability and the temperature-responsive\nproperty results in temperature-dependent vapor transport. The results show\nthat the membrane offers minimum resistance to WVT when the PVDF side faces the\nskin, which depicts the side with high humidity, over a range of temperatures.\nHowever, the same membrane shows a temperature-dependent WVT behavior when the\nblend side faces the skin. From room temperature of 25 C to an elevated\ntemperature of 35 C, there is a significant increase in the membrane's\nresistance to WVT. This behavior is attributed to the combined effect of the\nJanus construct and the thermoresponsive property. This temperature-controlled\ndifferential vapor transport offers ways to adapt vapor transport independence\nof environmental conditions leading to an enhanced wearing comfort and\nperformance to be applied in fields such as apparel or the packaging industry.",

      "title": "Controlling Electromagnetic Surface Waves with Conformal Transformation\n  Optics",
      "abstract": "The application of transformation optics to the development of intriguing\nelectromagnetic devices can produce weakly anisotropic or isotropic media with\nthe assistance of quasi-conformal and/or conformal mapping, as opposed to the\nstrongly anisotropic media produced by general mappings; however, it is\ntypically limited to two-dimensional applications. By addressing the conformal\nmapping between two manifolds embedded in three-dimensional space, we\ndemonstrate that electromagnetic surface waves can be controlled without\nintroducing singularity and anisotropy into the device parameters. Using\nfruitful surface conformal parameterization methods, a near-perfect conformal\nmapping between smooth manifolds with arbitrary boundaries can be obtained.\nIllustrations of cloaking and illusions, including surface Luneburg and Eaton\nlenses and black holes for surface waves, are provided. Our work brings the\nmanipulation of surface waves at microwave and optical wavelengths one step\ncloser.",

      "title": "RiskProp: Account Risk Rating on Ethereum via De-anonymous Score and\n  Network Propagation",
      "abstract": "As one of the most popular blockchain platforms supporting smart contracts,\nEthereum has caught the interest of both investors and criminals. Differently\nfrom traditional financial scenarios, executing Know Your Customer verification\non Ethereum is rather difficult due to the pseudonymous nature of the\nblockchain. Fortunately, as the transaction records stored in the Ethereum\nblockchain are publicly accessible, we can understand the behavior of accounts\nor detect illicit activities via transaction mining. Existing risk control\ntechniques have primarily been developed from the perspectives of\nde-anonymizing address clustering and illicit account classification. However,\nthese techniques cannot be used to ascertain the potential risks for all\naccounts and are limited by specific heuristic strategies or insufficient label\ninformation. These constraints motivate us to seek an effective rating method\nfor quantifying the spread of risk in a transaction network. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to address the problem of account risk rating on\nEthereum by proposing a novel model called RiskProp, which includes a\nde-anonymous score to measure transaction anonymity and a network propagation\nmechanism to formulate the relationships between accounts and transactions. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of RiskProp in overcoming the limitations of\nexisting models by conducting experiments on real-world datasets from Ethereum.\nThrough case studies on the detected high-risk accounts, we demonstrate that\nthe risk assessment by RiskProp can be used to provide warnings for investors\nand protect them from possible financial losses, and the superior performance\nof risk score-based account classification experiments further verifies the\neffectiveness of our rating method.",

Assuming a specific form of the stress energy tensor exact\nanalytic solutions of the field equation are generated in general theory of\nrelativity (GR) and Rastall theory. The non-singular black hole solutions are\nobtained with a finite pressure at the centre in $D=4$ dimensions. For $D>4$\nthe transverse pressure is found finite at the centre for a set of model\nparameters. In the later case the transverse pressure is more than that in the\nusual four dimensions. The exact analytic solution of the field equations in\nhigher dimensions for large $r$ coincides with the Schwarzschild black hole\nsolution in the usual four and in higher dimensions which is singularity free.\nThe different features of the generalized non-singular black hole in GR and\nmodified GR are explored.

      "abstract": "In the scenario of black-box adversarial attack, the target model's\nparameters are unknown, and the attacker aims to find a successful adversarial\nperturbation based on query feedback under a query budget. Due to the limited\nfeedback information, existing query-based black-box attack methods often\nrequire many queries for attacking each benign example. To reduce query cost,\nwe propose to utilize the feedback information across historical attacks,\ndubbed example-level adversarial transferability. Specifically, by treating the\nattack on each benign example as one task, we develop a meta-learning framework\nby training a meta-generator to produce perturbations conditioned on benign\nexamples. When attacking a new benign example, the meta generator can be\nquickly fine-tuned based on the feedback information of the new task as well as\na few historical attacks to produce effective perturbations. Moreover, since\nthe meta-train procedure consumes many queries to learn a generalizable\ngenerator, we utilize model-level adversarial transferability to train the\nmeta-generator on a white-box surrogate model, then transfer it to help the\nattack against the target model. The proposed framework with the two types of\nadversarial transferability can be naturally combined with any off-the-shelf\nquery-based attack methods to boost their performance, which is verified by\nextensive experiments.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid precoding plays a key role in realizing massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) transmitters with controllable cost. MIMO precoders are\nrequired to frequently adapt based on the variations in the channel conditions.\nIn hybrid MIMO, here precoding is comprised of digital and analog beamforming,\nsuch an adaptation involves lengthy optimization and depends on accurate\nchannel state information (CSI).

To cope with noisy\nCSI, we learn to optimize the minimal achievable sum-rate among all tolerable\nerrors, proposing a robust hybrid precoding based on the projected conceptual\nmirror prox minimax optimizer.

      "abstract": "Mineral dissolution in porous media coupled with single- or multi-phase flows\nis pervasive in natural and engineering systems including carbon capture and\nsequestration (CCS) and acid stimulation in reservoir engineering. Dissolution\nof minerals occurs as chemicals in the solid phase is transformed into ions in\nthe aqueous phase, effectively modifying the physical, hydrological and\ngeochemical properties of the solid matrix, and thus leading to the strong\ncoupling between local dissolution rate and pore-scale flow. However, our\nfundamental understanding of this coupling effect at the pore level is still\nlimited. In this work, mineral dissolution is studied using novel calcite-based\nporous micromodels under single- and multiphase conditions, with a focus on the\ninteractions of mineral dissolution with pore flow. The microfluidic devices\nused in the experiments were fabricated in calcite using photolithography and\nwet etching. These surrogate porous media offer precise control over the\nstructures and chemical properties and facilitate unobstructed and unaberrated\noptical access to the pore flow with micro-PIV methods. The preliminary results\nprovide a unique view of the flow dynamics during mineral dissolution. Based on\nthese pore-scale measurements, correlations between pore-scale flow and\ndissolution rates can be developed for several representative conditions.",

      "abstract": "The rapid development of technology has brought unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) to become widely known in the current era. The market of UAVs is also\npredicted to continue growing with related technologies in the future. UAVs\nhave been used in various sectors, including livestock, forestry, and\nagriculture. In agricultural applications, UAVs are highly capable of\nincreasing the productivity of the farm and reducing farmers' workload. This\npaper discusses the application of UAVs in agriculture, particularly in\nspraying and crop monitoring. This study examines the urgency of UAV\nimplementation in the agriculture sector. A short history of UAVs is provided\nin this paper to portray the development of UAVs from time to time. The\nclassification of UAVs is also discussed to differentiate various types of\nUAVs. The application of UAVs in spraying and crop monitoring is based on the\nprevious studies that have been done by many scientific groups and researchers\nwho are working closely to propose solutions for agriculture-related issues.\nFurthermore, the limitations of UAV applications are also identified. The\nchallenges in implementing agricultural UAVs in Indonesia are also presented.",

This paper proposes\na simple yet powerful way to represent trajectories and measure the similarity\nbetween two trajectories using a distributional kernel to address these\nshortcomings. It is a principled approach based on kernel mean embedding which\nhas a strong theoretical underpinning. It has three distinctive features in\ncomparison with existing approaches. (1) A distributional kernel is used for\nthe very first time for trajectory representation and similarity measurement.\n(2) It does not rely on point-to-point distances which are used in most\nexisting distances for trajectories. (3) It requires no learning, unlike\nexisting learning and deep learning approaches. We show the generality of this\nnew approach in three applications: (a) trajectory anomaly detection, (b)\nanomalous sub-trajectory detection, and (c) trajectory pattern mining. We\nidentify that the distributional kernel has (i) a unique data-dependent\nproperty and the above uniqueness property which are the key factors that lead\nto its superior task-specific performance; and (ii) runtime orders of magnitude\nfaster than existing distance measures.",

However, after analyzing the model vocabulary we\nfind that current models (both RNN-based and pre-training based) have more than\n23\\% inflected forms. As a result, the encoder will generate separate\nembeddings for the inflected forms, leading to a waste of training data and\nparameters. Even worse, in decoding these models are vulnerable to irrelevant\nnoise and they suffer from high computational costs. In this paper, we propose\nan approach to enhance the performance of QG by fusing word transformation.\nFirstly, we identify the inflected forms of words from the input of encoder,\nand replace them with the root words, letting the encoder pay more attention to\nthe repetitive root words. Secondly, we propose to adapt QG as a combination of\nthe following actions in the encode-decoder framework: generating a question\nword, copying a word from the source sequence or generating a word\ntransformation type. Such extension can greatly decrease the size of predicted\nwords in the decoder as well as noise. We apply our approach to a typical\nRNN-based model and \\textsc{UniLM} to get the improved versions. We conduct\nextensive experiments on SQuAD and MS MARCO datasets.

      "abstract": "As a new function of 6G networks, edge intelligence refers to the ubiquitous\ndeployment of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms at\nthe network edge to empower many emerging applications ranging from sensing to\nauto-pilot. To support relevant use cases, including sensing, edge learning,\nand edge inference, all require transmission of high-dimensional data or AI\nmodels over the air. To overcome the bottleneck, we propose a novel framework\nof SEMantic DAta Sourcing (SEMDAS) for locating semantically matched data\nsources to efficiently enable edge-intelligence operations. The comprehensive\nframework comprises new architecture, protocol, semantic matching techniques,\nand design principles for task-oriented wireless techniques. As the key\ncomponent of SEMDAS, we discuss a set of machine learning based semantic\nmatching techniques targeting different edge-intelligence use cases. Moreover,\nfor designing task-oriented wireless techniques, we discuss different tradeoffs\nin SEMDAS systems, propose the new concept of joint semantics-and-channel\nmatching, and point to a number of research opportunities. The SEMDAS framework\nnot only overcomes the said communication bottleneck but also addresses other\nnetworking issues including long-distance transmission, sparse connectivity,\nhigh-speed mobility, link disruptions, and security. In addition, experimental\nresults using a real dataset are presented to demonstrate the performance gain\nof SEMDAS.",

This technology provides more flexibility for users to\nsupport both deep learning training and inference workloads, but efficiently\nutilizing it can still be challenging. The vision of this paper is to provide a\nmore comprehensive and practical benchmark study for MIG in order to eliminate\nthe need for tedious manual benchmarking and tuning efforts. To achieve this\nvision, the paper presents MIGPerf, an open-source tool that streamlines the\nbenchmark study for MIG. Using MIGPerf, the authors conduct a series of\nexperiments, including deep learning training and inference characterization on\nMIG, GPU sharing characterization, and framework compatibility with MIG. The\nresults of these experiments provide new insights and guidance for users to\neffectively employ MIG, and lay the foundation for further research on the\norchestration of hybrid training and inference workloads on MIGs.

      "abstract": "Brain midline shift (MLS) is one of the most critical factors to be\nconsidered for clinical diagnosis and treatment decision-making for\nintracranial hemorrhage. Existing computational methods on MLS quantification\nnot only require intensive labeling in millimeter-level measurement but also\nsuffer from poor performance due to their dependence on specific landmarks or\nsimplified anatomical assumptions. In this paper, we propose a novel\nsemi-supervised framework to accurately measure the scale of MLS from head CT\nscans. We formulate the MLS measurement task as a deformation estimation\nproblem and solve it using a few MLS slices with sparse labels. Meanwhile, with\nthe help of diffusion models, we are able to use a great number of unlabeled\nMLS data and 2793 non-MLS cases for representation learning and regularization.\nThe extracted representation reflects how the image is different from a non-MLS\nimage and regularization serves an important role in the sparse-to-dense\nrefinement of the deformation field. Our experiment on a real clinical brain\nhemorrhage dataset has achieved state-of-the-art performance and can generate\ninterpretable deformation fields.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, various decentralized organizational forms have emerged,\nposing a challenge for organizational design. Some design elements, such as\ntask allocation, become emergent properties that cannot be fully controlled\nfrom the top down. The central question that arises in this context is: How can\nbottom-up task allocation be guided towards an effective organizational\nstructure? To address this question, this paper presents a novel agent-based\nmodel of an organization that features bottom-up task allocation that can be\nmotivated by either long-term or short-term orientation on the agents' side.\nThe model also includes an incentive mechanism to guide the bottom-up task\nallocation process and create incentives that range from altruistic to\nindividualistic. Our analysis shows that when bottom-up task allocation is\ndriven by short-term orientation and aligned with the incentive mechanisms, it\nleads to improved organizational performance that surpasses that of\ntraditionally designed organizations. Additionally, we find that the presence\nof altruistic incentive mechanisms within the organization reduces the\nimportance of mirroring in task allocation.",

      "abstract": "Resource disaggregation offers a cost effective solution to resource scaling,\nutilization, and failure-handling in data centers by physically separating\nhardware devices in a server. Servers are architected as pools of processor,\nmemory, and storage devices, organized as independent failure-isolated\ncomponents interconnected by a high-bandwidth network. A critical challenge,\nhowever, is the high performance penalty of accessing data from a remote memory\nmodule over the network. Addressing this challenge is difficult as\ndisaggregated systems have high runtime variability in network\nlatencies/bandwidth, and page migration can significantly delay critical path\ncache line accesses in other pages.\n  This paper conducts a characterization analysis on different data movement\nstrategies in fully disaggregated systems, evaluates their performance\noverheads in a variety of workloads, and introduces DaeMon, the first\nsoftware-transparent mechanism to significantly alleviate data movement\noverheads in fully disaggregated systems. First, to enable scalability to\nmultiple hardware components in the system, we enhance each compute and memory\nunit with specialized engines that transparently handle data migrations.\nSecond, to achieve high performance and provide robustness across various\nnetwork, architecture and application characteristics, we implement a\nsynergistic approach of bandwidth partitioning, link compression, decoupled\ndata movement of multiple granularities, and adaptive granularity selection in\ndata movements. We evaluate DaeMon in a wide variety of workloads at different\nnetwork and architecture configurations using a state-of-the-art accurate\nsimulator.

According to comprehensive experimental results on two corpora,\nincluding the VLSP2016-SA corpus of technical article reviews from the news and\nsocial media and the UIT-VSFC corpus of the educational survey, we have two\nsuggestions.

Secondly,\nword segmentation is necessary for Vietnamese sentiment classification when\nword segmentation is used before using the BPE method and feeding into the deep\nlearning model.

The\nexperimental results show that the semantic-aware contextual representation\nmodel has about 1% higher performance than the model that does not incorporate\nsemantic representation.

Nevertheless, the precise processes that are involved in\nthis phenomenon need to be better constrained. In this study, the causes of\ngiant landslides are investigated using a modeling approach. Here, we show that\nthe effect of meteoritic water infiltration could be discriminated from that of\nsea-level rise on triggering paleolandslides. It is possible to identify the\ncause of coastal paleolandslides based on the age of occurrence and comparison\nwith climatic signals when glacial maxima are more humid than during\ninterglacial times, as in Polynesia and East Equatorial Africa, but not in\nother cases (Caribbean, Indonesia). The role of pore pressure variations and\nsea-water loading variations has been discussed. The interaction between the\nrelative sea-level rise, preexisting relief and deep weak structure due to the\npresence of highly weathered lavas may trigger the conditions for a large\nlandslide. Highly weathered lavas have very low friction angles at depth in\nvolcanic islands. When volcanoes are still actives, pressure variation of the\nmagma chamber caused by sea-level lowering is expected to play a significant\nrole in destabilization of the relief.

In the investigated framework, a set of servers cooperatively\ntransmit images to a set of users utilizing semantic communication techniques.\nTo evaluate the performance of studied semantic communication system, a\nmultimodal metric is proposed to measure the correlation between the extracted\nsemantic information and the original image. To meet the ISS requirement of\neach user, each server must jointly determine the semantic information to be\ntransmitted and the resource blocks (RBs) used for semantic information\ntransmission. We formulate this problem as an optimization problem aiming to\nminimize each server's transmission latency while reaching the ISS requirement.\nTo solve this problem, a value decomposition based entropy-maximized\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed, which enables servers to\ncoordinate for training and execute RB allocation in a distributed manner to\napproach to a globally optimal performance with less training iterations.\nCompared to traditional multi-agent RL, the proposed RL improves the valuable\naction exploration of servers and the probability of finding a globally optimal\nRB allocation policy based on local observation.

      "abstract": "Wild images on the web are vulnerable to backdoor (also called trojan)\npoisoning, causing machine learning models learned on these images to be\ninjected with backdoors. Most previous attacks assumed that the wild images are\nlabeled. In reality, however, most images on the web are unlabeled.\nSpecifically, we study the effects of unlabeled backdoor images under\nsemi-supervised learning (SSL) on widely studied deep neural networks. To be\nrealistic, we assume that the adversary is zero-knowledge and that the\nsemi-supervised learning model is trained from scratch. Firstly, we find the\nfact that backdoor poisoning always fails when poisoned unlabeled images come\nfrom different classes, which is different from poisoning the labeled images.\nThe reason is that the SSL algorithms always strive to correct them during\ntraining. Therefore, for unlabeled images, we implement backdoor poisoning on\nimages from the target class. Then, we propose a gradient matching strategy to\ncraft poisoned images such that their gradients match the gradients of target\nimages on the SSL model, which can fit poisoned images to the target class and\nrealize backdoor injection. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first\napproach to backdoor poisoning on unlabeled images of trained-from-scratch SSL\nmodels. Experiments show that our poisoning achieves state-of-the-art attack\nsuccess rates on most SSL algorithms while bypassing modern backdoor defenses.",

Deep learning models that\nreceive as input functional connectivity (FC) features among brain regions have\nbeen commonly adopted in the literature. However, many models focus on\ntemporally static FC features across a scan, reducing sensitivity to dynamic\nfeatures of brain activity. Here, we describe a plug-in graph neural network\nthat can be flexibly integrated into a main learning-based fMRI model to boost\nits temporal sensitivity. Receiving brain regions as nodes and\nblood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals as node inputs, the proposed\nGraphCorr method leverages a node embedder module based on a transformer\nencoder to capture temporally-windowed latent representations of BOLD signals.\nGraphCorr also leverages a lag filter module to account for delayed\ninteractions across nodes by computing cross-correlation of windowed BOLD\nsignals across a range of time lags. Information captured by the two modules is\nfused via a message passing algorithm executed on the graph, and enhanced node\nfeatures are then computed at the output. These enhanced features are used to\ndrive a subsequent learning-based model to analyze fMRI time series with\nelevated sensitivity. Comprehensive demonstrations on two public datasets\nindicate improved classification performance and interpretability for several\nstate-of-the-art graphical and convolutional methods that employ\nGraphCorr-derived feature representations of fMRI time series as their input.",

      "title": "An Overview of Limitations and Approaches in Identity Management",
      "abstract": "Identity and access management (I&AM) is the umbrella term for managing users\nand their permissions. It is required for users to access different services.\nThese services can either be provided from their home organization, like a\ncompany or university, or from external service providers, e.g., cooperation\npartners. I&AM provides the management of identifiers with the attributes,\ncredentials, roles, and permissions the user has. Today, the requirements have\nevolved from simply accessing individual web services in the internet or at a\ncompany to the majority of all IT services from different service providers\nwith various accounts. Several identity management models have been created\nwith different approaches within.\n  In order to adjust to heterogeneous environments, use cases, and the\nevolution of identity management, this paper extends known requirements for\nidentity management. Existing models and approaches for identity management are\nmapped to the derived requirements. Based on the mapping, advantages,\ndisadvantages, and gaps are identified. Current approaches suffer, as an\nexample, from trustworthiness and liability issues. Interoperability issues are\neven more inherent as the approaches partly develop apart, forming an\nheterogeneous environment. The results from this analysis emphasize the need\nfor one holistic identity management framework.",

      "abstract": "Identity management refers to the technology and policies for the\nidentification, authentication, and authorization of users in computer\nnetworks. Identity management is therefore fundamental to today's IT ecosystem.\nAt the same time, identity management systems, where digital identities are\nmanaged, pose an attractive target for attacks. With the heterogeneity of\nidentity management systems, every type (i.e., models, protocols,\nimplementations) has different requirements, typical problems, and hence attack\nvectors. In order to provide a systematic and categorized overview, the\nframework Taxonomy for Identity Management Attacks (TaxIdMA) for attacks\nrelated to identities is proposed. The purpose of this framework is to classify\nexisting attacks associated with system identities, identity management\nsystems, and end-user identities as well as the background using an extensible\nstructure from a scientific perspective. The taxonomy is then evaluated with\neight real-world attacks resp. vulnerabilities. This analysis shows the\ncapability of the proposed taxonomy framework TaxIdMA in describing and\ncategorizing these attacks.",

The analysis of existing approaches using the\nresulting identity management cube (IMC) highlights the trade-off between user\ncontrol and trust in attributes. A comparative analysis of IMC and established\nmodels identifies missing links between the approaches. The IMC is extended by\na morphology of identity management, describing characteristics of cooperation.\nThe morphology is then mapped to the life cycle of users and identity\nmanagement in a further step. These classifications are practically underlined\nwith current approaches. Both methods combined provide a comprehensive\ncharacterization of identity management approaches.

The conventional solution to recovering\ntree-structured geometries typically involves computing the minimal cost path\nthrough intermediate representations derived from segmentation masks. However,\nthis methodology has significant limitations in the context of projective\nimaging of tree-structured 3D anatomical data such as coronary arteries, since\nthere are often overlapping branches in the 2D projection. In this work, we\npropose a novel approach to predicting tree connectivity structure which\nreformulates the task as an optimization problem over individual steps of a\nrecursive process. We design and train a two-stage model which leverages the\nUNet and Transformer architectures and introduces an image-based prompting\ntechnique. Our proposed method achieves compelling results on a pair of\nsynthetic datasets, and outperforms a shortest-path baseline.",

Direct integration of the radiative transfer\nequation and solutions using photon packets are examined, both for solutions to\nthe time-dependent radiative transfer equation and in the\ninfinite-speed-of-light approximation. The photon packet schemes are found to\nbe more generally computationally efficient than a direct integration scheme.\nWhilst all codes accurately describe the growth rate of hydrogen and helium\nionization zones, it is shown that a fully time-dependent method is required to\ncapture the gas temperature and ionization structure in the near zone of a\nsource when an ionization front expands at a speed close to the speed of light.\nApplied to Quasi-Stellar Objects in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR),\ntemperature differences as high as $5\\times10^4$ K result in the near-zone for\nsolutions of the time-dependent radiative transfer equation compared with\nsolutions in the infinite-speed-of-light approximation. Smaller temperature\ndifferences are found following the nearly full photoionization of helium in\ngas in which the hydrogen was already ionized and the helium was singly\nionized. Variations found in the temperature and ionization structure far from\nthe source, where the gas is predominantly neutral, may affect some predictions\nfor 21-cm EoR experiments.",

Optimal planning of pipelines is an example of decision-making\nproblem and was the focus of many researchers in the past years. The use of\nmixed integer linear programming (MILP) is one of the efficient methods to\nsolve this problem. However, models still ignore important operational\nchallenges.

In this research, we intend to facilitate\nthe decision-making process for experts in the field of distribution of oil\nproducts.

      "abstract": "Although the effects of the social norm on mitigating misinformation are\nidentified, scant knowledge exists about the patterns of social norm emergence,\nsuch as the patterns and variations of social tipping in online communities\nwith diverse characteristics. Accordingly, this study investigates the features\nof social tipping in online communities and examines the correlations between\nthe tipping features and characteristics of online communities. Taking the side\neffects of COVID-19 vaccination as the case topic, we first track the patterns\nof tipping features in 100 online communities, which are detected using Louvain\nAlgorithm from the aggregated communication network on Twitter between May 2020\nand April 2021. Then, we use multi-variant linear regression to explore the\ncorrelations between tipping features and community characteristics. We find\nthat social tipping in online communities can sustain for two to four months\nand lead to a 50% increase in populations who accept the normative belief in\nonline communities. The regression indicates that the duration of social\ntipping is positively related to the community populations and original\nacceptance of social norms, while the correlation between the tipping duration\nand the degrees among community members is negative. Additionally, the network\nmodularity and original acceptance of social norms have negative relationships\nwith the extent of social tipping, while the degree and betweenness centrality\ncan have significant positive relationships with the extent of tipping. Our\nfindings shed light on more precise normative interventions on misinformation\nin digital environments as it offers preliminary evidence about the timing and\nmechanism of social norm emergence.",

      "abstract": "For a century, clinical X-ray imaging has visualised only the attenuation\nproperties of tissue, which fundamentally limits the contrast, particularly in\nsoft tissues like the breast. Imaging based on refraction can overcome this\nlimitation, but so far has been constrained to high-dose ex-vivo applications\nor required highly coherent X-ray sources, like synchrotrons. It has been\npredicted that grating interferometry (GI) could eventually allow computed\ntomography (CT) to be more dose-efficient. However, the benefit of refraction\nin clinical CT has not been demonstrated so far. Here we show that GI-CT is\nmore dose-efficient in imaging of breast tissue than conventional CT. Our\nsystem, based on a 70kVp X-ray tube source and commercially available gratings,\ndemonstrated superior quality, in terms of adipose-to-glandular tissue\ncontrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), of refraction-contrast compared to the\nattenuation images. The fusion of the two modes of contrast outperformed\nconventional CT for spatial resolutions better than 263{\\mu}m and an average\ndose to the breast of 16mGy, which is in the clinical breast CT range. Our\nresults show that grating interferometry can significantly reduce the dose,\nwhile maintaining the image quality, in diagnostic breast CT. Unlike\nconventional absorption-based CT, the sensitivity of refraction-based imaging\nis far from being fully exploited, and further progress will lead to\nsignificant improvements of clinical X-ray CT.",

One\nof them is its characteristic lengths: what sets the size of these filaments,\nand how does this impact resistive switching properties. Here we use a\ncombination of wide-field and scattering-type scanning near-field optical\nmicroscopies to characterize filament formation in NdNiO3 and SmNiO3 thin\nfilms. We find a clear trend: smaller filaments increase the current density,\nyielding sharper switching and a larger resistive drop.

The\nequations are coupled by zero or first order coupling terms, with constant\ncoupling matrices, without any structure assumptions on them. The distributed\ncontrol acts through a constant matrix operator on the system, so that there\nmight be notably less controls than equations, encompassing the case of\nindirect and simultaneous controllability. More precisely, we prove that in\nsmall time, such kind of systems are never controllable in appropriate Sobolev\nspaces, whereas in large time, null-controllability holds, for sufficiently\nregular initial data, if and and only if a spectral Kalman rank condition is\nverified. We also prove that initial data that are not regular enough are not\ncontrollable. Positive results are obtained by using the so-called fictitious\ncontrol method together with an algebraic solvability argument, whereas the\nnegative results are obtained by using an appropriate WKB construction of\napproximate solutions for the adjoint system associated to the control problem.\nAs an application to our general results, we also investigate into details the\ncase of $2\\times2$ systems (i.e., one pure transport equation and one parabolic\nequation).",

We investigate the low-density regime\nof the homogeneous electron gas, where low-energy collective excitations and\nghost modes were anticipated. Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we show\nthat both phenomena exist thanks to reduced screening at short distances. This\nis not captured by common approximations used in ab initio BSE calculations,\nbut requires vertex corrections that take the fermionic nature of charges into\naccount. The electron-hole wavefunction of the low-energy modes shows strong\nand very anisotropic electron-hole correlation, which speaks for an excitonic\ncharacter of these modes. The fact that short-range physics is at the origin of\nthese phenomena explains why, on the other hand, also the simple adiabatic\nlocal density approximation to time-dependent density functional theory can\ncapture these effects.",

      "abstract": "Blockchain, also coined as decentralized AI, has the potential to empower AI\nto be more trustworthy by creating a decentralized trust of privacy, security,\nand audibility. However, systematic studies on the design principle of\nblockchain as a trust engine for an integrated society of\ncyber-physical-social-system (CPSS) are still absent. In this article, we\nprovide an initiative for seeking the design principle of blockchain for a\nbetter digital world. Using a hybrid method of qualitative and quantitative\nstudies, we examine the past origin, the current development, and the future\ndirections of blockchain design principles. We have three findings. First, the\nanswer to whether blockchain lives up to its original design principle as a\ndistributed database is controversial. Second, the current development of the\nblockchain community reveals a taxonomy of 7 categories, namely, privacy and\nsecurity, scalability, decentralization, applicability, governance and\nregulation, system design, and cross-chain interoperability. Both research and\npractice are more centered around the first category of privacy and security\nand the fourth category of applicability. Future scholars, practitioners, and\npolicy-makers have vast opportunities in other, much less exploited facets and\nthe synthesis at the interface of multiple aspects. Finally, in\ncounter-examples, we conclude that a synthetic solution that crosses discipline\nboundaries is necessary to close the gaps between the current design of\nblockchain and the design principle of a trust engine for a truly intelligent\nworld.",

This $\\sim 1.5 \\times 1.5$ parsec-scale filament hub\ncontains $\\sim$500 $M_\\odot$. Seen from Planck, magnetic field lines may have\nfacilitated the gathering of material at this isolated location. The energy\nbalance analysis, supported by infalling gas signatures, reveal that these\nfilaments are currently forming stars. Herschel 100 $\\mu$m emission\nconcentrates in the hub, at IRAS 05451+0037 and LkH$\\alpha$ 316, and presents\ndiffuse lobes and loops around them. We suggest that such a double centre could\nbe formed, because the converging locations of filament pairs are offset, by\n2.3$'$ (0.27 pc). This distance also matches the diameter of a hub-ring, seen\nin column density and molecular tracers, such as HCO$^+$(1$-$0) and HCN(1$-$0),\nthat may indicate a transition and the connection between the hub and the\nradiating filaments. We argue that all of the three components of the emission\nstar LkH$\\alpha$ 316 are in physical association. We find that a $\\sim$0.06\npc-sized gas loop, attached to IRAS 05451+0037, can be seen at wavelengths all\nthe way from Pan-STARRS-i to Herschel-100 $\\mu$m. These observations suggest\nthat both protostars at the double hub centre are interacting with the cloud\nmaterial. In our $^{13}$CO data, we do not seem to find the outflow of this\nregion that was identified in the 80s with much lower resolution.",

      "abstract": "Video Annotation is a crucial process in computer science and social science\nalike. Many video annotation tools (VATs) offer a wide range of features for\nmaking annotation possible. We conducted an extensive survey of over 59 VATs\nand interviewed interdisciplinary researchers to evaluate the usability of\nVATs. Our findings suggest that most current VATs have overwhelming user\ninterfaces, poor interaction techniques, and difficult-to-understand features.\nThese often lead to longer annotation time, label inconsistencies, and user\nfatigue. We introduce FEVA, a video annotation tool with streamlined\ninteraction techniques and a dynamic interface that makes labeling tasks easy\nand fast. FEVA focuses on speed, accuracy, and simplicity to make annotation\nquick, consistent, and straightforward. For example, annotators can control the\nspeed and direction of the video and mark the onset and the offset of a label\nin real time with single key presses. In our user study, FEVA users, on\naverage, require 36% less interaction than the most popular annotation tools\n(Advene, ANVIL, ELAN, VIA, and VIAN). The participants (N=32) rated FEVA as\nmore intuitive and required less mental demand. The code and demo are available\nat http://www.snehesh.com/feva.",

      "title": "Inferring multiple consensus trees and supertrees using clustering: a\n  review",
      "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees (i.e. evolutionary trees, additive trees or X-trees) play\na key role in the processes of modeling and representing species evolution.\nGenome evolution of a given group of species is usually modeled by a species\nphylogenetic tree that represents the main patterns of vertical descent.\nHowever, the evolution of each gene is unique. It can be represented by its own\ngene tree which can differ substantially from a general species tree\nrepresentation. Consensus trees and supertrees have been widely used in\nevolutionary studies to combine phylogenetic information contained in\nindividual gene trees. Nevertheless, if the available gene trees are quite\ndifferent from each other, then the resulting consensus tree or supertree can\neither include many unresolved subtrees corresponding to internal nodes of high\ndegree or can simply be a star tree. This may happen if the available gene\ntrees have been affected by different reticulate evolutionary events, such as\nhorizontal gene transfer, hybridization or genetic recombination. Thus, the\nproblem of inferring multiple alternative consensus trees or supertrees, using\nclustering, becomes relevant since it allows one to regroup in different\nclusters gene trees having similar evolutionary patterns (e.g. gene trees\nrepresenting genes that have undergone the same horizontal gene transfer or\nrecombination events). We critically review recent advances and methods in the\nfield of phylogenetic tree clustering, discuss the methods' mathematical\nproperties, and describe the main advantages and limitations of multiple\nconsensus tree and supertree approaches. In the application section, we show\nhow the multiple supertree clustering approach can be used to cluster aaRS gene\ntrees according to their evolutionary patterns.",

      "abstract": "Industry 4.0 operates based on IoT devices, sensors, and actuators,\ntransforming the use of computing resources and software solutions in diverse\nsectors. Various Industry 4.0 latency-sensitive applications function based on\nmachine learning to process sensor data for automation and other industrial\nactivities. Sending sensor data to cloud systems is time consuming and\ndetrimental to the latency constraints of the applications, thus, fog computing\nis often deployed. Executing these applications across heterogeneous fog\nsystems demonstrates stochastic execution time behavior that affects the task\ncompletion time. We investigate and model various Industry 4.0 ML-based\napplications' stochastic executions and analyze them. Industries like oil and\ngas are prone to disasters requiring coordination of various latency-sensitive\nactivities. Hence, fog computing resources can get oversubscribed due to the\nsurge in the computing demands during a disaster. We propose federating nearby\nfog computing systems and forming a fog federation to make remote Industry 4.0\nsites resilient against the surge in computing demands. We propose a\nstatistical resource allocation method across fog federation for\nlatency-sensitive tasks. Many of the modern Industry 4.0 applications operate\nbased on a workflow of micro-services that are used alone within an industrial\nsite. As such, industry 4.0 solutions need to be aware of applications'\narchitecture, particularly monolithic vs. micro-service. Therefore, we propose\na probability-based resource allocation method that can partition micro-service\nworkflows across fog federation to meet their latency constraints. Another\nconcern in Industry 4.0 is the data privacy of the federated fog. As such, we\npropose a solution based on federated learning to train industrial ML\napplications across federated fog systems without compromising the data\nconfidentiality.",

      "abstract": "In time entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD), Alice and Bob\nextract the raw key bits from the (identical) arrival times of entangled photon\npairs by time-binning. Each of them individually discretizes time into bins and\ngroups them into frames. They retain only the frames with a single occupied\nbin. Thus, Alice and Bob can use the position of the occupied bin within a\nframe to generate random key bits, as in PPM modulation. Because of\nentanglement, their occupied bins and their keys should be identical. However,\npractical photon detectors suffer from time jitter errors. These errors cause\ndiscrepancies between Alice's and Bob's keys. Alice sends information to Bob\nthrough the public channel to reconcile the keys.

      "abstract": "Cosmological tensions in current times have opened a wide door to study new\nprobes to constrain cosmological parameters, specifically, to determine the\nvalue of the Hubble constant $H_0$ through independent techniques. The two\nstandard methods to measure/infer $H_0$ rely on: (i) anchored observables for\nthe distance ladder, and (ii) establishing the relationship of the $H_0$ to the\nangular size of the sound horizon in the recombination era assuming a standard\nCosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) cosmology. However, the\nformer requires a calibration with observables at nearby distances, while the\nlatter is not a direct measurement and is model-dependent. The physics behind\nthese aspects restrains our possibilities in selecting a calibration method\nthat can help minimise the systematic effects or in considering a fixed\ncosmological model background. Anticipating the possibility of deeply exploring\nthe physics of new nearby observables such as the recently detected black hole\nshadows, in this paper we propose standard rules to extend the studies related\nto these observables. Supermassive black hole shadows can be characterised by\ntwo parameters: the angular size of the shadow and the black hole mass. We\nfound that it is possible to break the degeneracy between these parameters by\nforecasting and fixing certain conditions at high(er) redshifts, i.e., instead\nof considering the $\\approx$10\\% precision from the EHT array, our results\nreach a $\\approx 4\\%$, a precision that could be achievable in experiments in\nthe near future.",

Studies that investigate the jet's response to these\nthermal forcings show that it is sensitive to model type, season, initial\natmospheric conditions, and the shape and magnitude of the forcing. Much of\nthis past work focuses on studying a simulation's response to external\nmanipulation. In contrast, we explore the potential to train a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) on internal variability alone and then use it to examine\npossible nonlinear responses of the jet to tropospheric thermal forcing that\nmore closely resemble anthropogenic climate change. Our approach leverages the\nidea behind the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which relates the internal\nvariability of a system to its forced response but so far has been only used to\nquantify linear responses. We train a CNN on data from a long control run of\nthe CESM dry dynamical core and show that it is able to skillfully predict the\nnonlinear response of the jet to sustained external forcing. The trained CNN\nprovides a quick method for exploring the jet stream sensitivity to a wide\nrange of tropospheric temperature tendencies and, considering that this method\ncan likely be applied to any model with a long control run, could lend itself\nuseful for early stage experiment design.",

PokAR aims to alleviate three difficulties of traditional poker by\nleveraging AR technology: (1) need to have physical poker chips, (2) complex\nrules of poker, (3) slow game pace caused by laborious tasks. Despite the\npotential benefits of AR in poker, not much research has been done in the\nfield. In fact, PokAR is the first application to enable AR poker on a mobile\ndevice without requiring extra costly equipment. This has been done by creating\na Snapchat Lens which can be used on most mobile devices. We evaluated this\napplication by instructing 4 participant dyads to use PokAR to engage in poker\nplay and respond to survey questions about their experience. We found that most\nPokAR features were positively received, AR did not significantly improve nor\nhinder socialization, PokAR slightly increased the game pace, and participants\nhad an overall enjoyable experience with the Lens. These findings led to three\nmajor conclusions: (1) AR has the potential to augment and simplify traditional\ntable games, (2) AR should not be used to replace traditional experiences, only\naugment them, (3) Future work includes additional features like increased\ntactility and statistical annotations.",

      "abstract": "Given a matrix $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$ and a vector $b\\in\n\\mathbb{R}^n$, we consider the regression problem with $\\ell_\\infty$\nguarantees: finding a vector $x'\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ such that $ \\|x'-x^*\\|_\\infty\n\\leq \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sqrt{d}}\\cdot \\|Ax^*-b\\|_2\\cdot \\|A^\\dagger\\|$ where\n$x^*=\\arg\\min_{x\\in \\mathbb{R}^d}\\|Ax-b\\|_2$. One popular approach for solving\nsuch $\\ell_2$ regression problem is via sketching: picking a structured random\nmatrix $S\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ with $m\\ll n$ and $SA$ can be quickly\ncomputed, solve the ``sketched'' regression problem $\\arg\\min_{x\\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d} \\|SAx-Sb\\|_2$. In this paper, we show that in order to obtain\nsuch $\\ell_\\infty$ guarantee for $\\ell_2$ regression, one has to use sketching\nmatrices that are dense. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first user\ncase in which dense sketching matrices are necessary. On the algorithmic side,\nwe prove that there exists a distribution of dense sketching matrices with\n$m=\\epsilon^{-2}d\\log^3(n/\\delta)$ such that solving the sketched regression\nproblem gives the $\\ell_\\infty$ guarantee, with probability at least\n$1-\\delta$. Moreover, the matrix $SA$ can be computed in time $O(nd\\log n)$.\nOur row count is nearly-optimal up to logarithmic factors, and significantly\nimproves the result in [Price, Song and Woodruff, ICALP'17], in which a\nsuper-linear in $d$ rows, $m=\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-2}d^{1+\\gamma})$ for\n$\\gamma=\\Theta(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log\\log n}{\\log d}})$ is required. We also develop\na novel analytical framework for $\\ell_\\infty$ guarantee regression that\nutilizes the Oblivious Coordinate-wise Embedding (OCE) property introduced in\n[Song and Yu, ICML'21]. Our analysis is arguably much simpler and more general\nthan [Price, Song and Woodruff, ICALP'17], and it extends to dense sketches for\ntensor product of vectors.",

Such an approach may not be feasible for various\nmachine learning models because of the complexity of computing the explicit\ndistributions.

This paper develops a new variant of the classical\nCumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm for the quickest change detection. This\nvariant is based on Fisher divergence and the Hyv\\\"arinen score and is called\nthe Score-based CUSUM (SCUSUM) algorithm. The SCUSUM algorithm allows the\napplications of change detection for unnormalized statistical models, i.e.,\nmodels for which the probability density function contains an unknown\nnormalization constant. The asymptotic optimality of the proposed algorithm is\ninvestigated by deriving expressions for average detection delay and the mean\nrunning time to a false alarm.

The diproton and tri-body\nformulae, combined with information on the two-nucleon transfer amplitude and\nWigner single-particle reduced width, can reproduce well experimental $2p$\nradioactivity half-lives. For the case of $^{67}$Kr, theoretical predictions\nfor direct $2p$ decay give much larger half-lives than the recent measurement\nfrom RIKEN. A combination of direct and sequential $2p$ emission is analyzed by\nconsidering a small negative one-proton separation energy and a possible\nenhanced contribution from the $p$-wave component. The present method predicts\nthat $^{71}$Sr and $^{74}$Zr may be the most promising candidates for future\nstudy on $2p$ radioactivity.

Previous monitoring shows three excursion events in\n1996--1998, 2005--2007, and 2014--2016. The superorbital period drifts from >60\ndays to <40 days and then evolves back during an excursion. Here we report a\nnew excursion event of SMC X-1 in 2020--2021, indicating that the superorbital\nmodulation has an unpredictable, chaotic nature. We trace the spin-period\nevolution and find that the spin-up rate accelerated one year before the onset\nof this new excursion, which suggests a possible inside-out process connecting\nthe spin-up acceleration and the superorbital excursion. This results in a\ndeviation of the spin period residual, similar to the behaviour of the first\nexcursion in 1996--1998. In further analysis of the pulse profile evolution, we\nfind that the pulsed fraction shows a long-term evolution and may be connected\nto the superorbital excursion. These discoveries deepen the mystery of SMC X-1\nbecause they cannot be solely interpreted by the warped disc model.

      "abstract": "We study the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible items to a set\nof agents with additive valuations. Recently, Feige et al.

Moreover, they proved that an MMS allocation is\nnot guaranteed to exist for instances with $3$ agents and at least $9$ items,\nor $n \\ge 4$ agents and at least $3n + 3$ items. In this work, we shrink the\ngap between these upper and lower bounds for guaranteed existence of MMS\nallocations. We prove that for any integer $c > 0$, there exists a number of\nagents $n_c$ such that an MMS allocation exists for any instance with $n \\ge\nn_c$ agents and at most $n + c$ items, where $n_c \\le \\lfloor 0.6597^c \\cdot\nc!\\rfloor$ for allocation of goods and $n_c \\le \\lfloor 0.7838^c \\cdot\nc!\\rfloor$ for chores.

      "abstract": "The linear combination of Student's $t$ random variables (RVs) appears in\nmany statistical applications. Unfortunately, the Student's $t$ distribution is\nnot closed under convolution, thus, deriving an exact and general distribution\nfor the linear combination of $K$ Student's $t$ RVs is infeasible, which\nmotivates a fitting/approximation approach. Here, we focus on the scenario\nwhere the only constraint is that the number of degrees of freedom of each\n$t-$RV is greater than two. Notice that since the odd moments/cumulants of the\nStudent's $t$ distribution are zero, and the even moments/cumulants do not\nexist when their order is greater than the number of degrees of freedom, it\nbecomes impossible to use conventional approaches based on moments/cumulants of\norder one or higher than two. To circumvent this issue, herein we propose\nfitting such a distribution to that of a scaled Student's $t$ RV by exploiting\nthe second moment together with either the first absolute moment or the\ncharacteristic function (CF). For the fitting based on the absolute moment, we\ndepart from the case of the linear combination of $K= 2$ Student's $t$ RVs and\nthen generalize to $K\\ge 2$ through a simple iterative procedure. Meanwhile,\nthe CF-based fitting is direct, but its accuracy (measured in terms of the\nBhattacharyya distance metric) depends on the CF parameter configuration, for\nwhich we propose a simple but accurate approach. We numerically show that the\nCF-based fitting usually outperforms the absolute moment -based fitting and\nthat both the scale and number of degrees of freedom of the fitting\ndistribution increase almost linearly with $K$.",

To this end, RePro addresses the two\ntechnical challenges of Open-VidVRD: 1) the prompt tokens should respect the\ntwo different semantic roles of subject and object, and 2) the tuning should\naccount for the diverse spatio-temporal motion patterns of the subject-object\ncompositions. Without bells and whistles, our RePro achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art performance on two VidVRD benchmarks of not only the base\ntraining object and predicate categories, but also the unseen ones.

      "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) provides an emerging approach for collaboratively\ntraining semantic encoder/decoder models of semantic communication systems,\nwithout private user data leaving the devices. Most existing studies on\ntrustworthy FL aim to eliminate data poisoning threats that are produced by\nmalicious clients, but in many cases, eliminating model poisoning attacks\nbrought by fake servers is also an important objective. In this paper, a\ncertificateless authentication-based trustworthy federated learning (CATFL)\nframework is proposed, which mutually authenticates the identity of clients and\nserver. In CATFL, each client verifies the server's signature information\nbefore accepting the delivered global model to ensure that the global model is\nnot delivered by false servers. On the contrary, the server also verifies the\nserver's signature information before accepting the delivered model updates to\nensure that they are submitted by authorized clients. Compared to PKI-based\nmethods, the CATFL can avoid too high certificate management overheads.\nMeanwhile, the anonymity of clients shields data poisoning attacks, while\nreal-name registration may suffer from user-specific privacy leakage risks.\nTherefore, a pseudonym generation strategy is also presented in CATFL to\nachieve a trade-off between identity traceability and user anonymity, which is\nessential to conditionally prevent from user-specific privacy leakage.\nTheoretical security analysis and evaluation results validate the superiority\nof CATFL.",

We show that both spectroscopic signatures have distinct\nphysical origins.

In contrast, nodal lines in RCs are explained by\ncoherence transfer of vibrational wavepackets which do not participate in the\nultrafast energy transfer and their destructive interference with ground state\npathways.

Previous model inference frameworks are mainly developed in an\noperator-centric way, which provides insufficient acceleration to edge-based\ninference. Besides, the operator-centric framework incurs significant costs for\ncontinuous development and maintenance.\n  In this paper, we propose Xenos, which can automatically conduct\ndataflow-centric optimization of the computation graph and accelerate inference\nin two dimensions. Vertically, Xenos develops operator linking technique to\nimprove data locality by restructuring the inter-operator dataflow.\nHorizontally, Xenos develops DSP-aware operator split technique to enable\nhigher parallelism across multiple DSP units. Our evaluation proves the\neffectiveness of vertical and horizontal dataflow optimization, which reduce\nthe inference time by 21.2\\%--84.9\\% and 17.9\\%--96.2\\% , respectively.\nBesides, Xenos also outperforms the widely-used TVM by\n3.22$\\times$--17.92$\\times$. Moreover, we extend Xenos to a distributed\nsolution, which we call d-Xenos. d-Xenos employs multiple edge devices to\njointly conduct the inference task and achieves a speedup of 3.68x--3.78x\ncompared with the single device.",

      "title": "Evolution of interface magnetism in Fe/Alq3 bilayer",
      "abstract": "Interface magnetism and topological structure of Fe on organic semiconductor\nfilm (Alq3) have been studied and compared with Fe film deposited directly on\nSi (100) substrate. To get information on the diffused Fe layer at the Fe/Alq3\ninterface, grazing incident nuclear resonance scattering (GINRS) measurements\nare made depth selective by introducing a 95% enriched thin 57Fe layer at the\nInterface and producing x-ray standing wave within the layered structure.\nCompared with Fe growth on Si substrate, where film exhibits a hyperfine field\nvalue of 32 T (Bulk Fe), a thick Fe- Alq3 interface has been found with reduced\nelectron density and hyperfine fields providing evidence of deep penetration of\nFe atoms into Alq3 film. Due to the soft nature of Alq3, Fe moments relax in\nthe film plane. At the same time, Fe on Si has a resultant ~43 deg out-of-plane\norientation of Fe moments at the Interface due to the stressed and rough Fe\nlayer near Si. The evolution of magnetism at the Fe-Alq3 Interface is monitored\nusing in-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) during the growth of Fe on the\nAlq3 surface and small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. It is found\nthat the Fe atom tries to organize into clusters to minimize their\nsurface/interface energy. The origin of the 2.4 nm thick magnetic dead layer at\nthe Interface is attributed to the small Fe clusters of paramagnetic or\nsuperparamagnetic nature. The present work provides an understanding of\ninterfacial magnetism at metal-organic interfaces and the topological study\nusing the GI-NRS technique, which is made depth selective to probe magnetism of\nthe diffused ferromagnetic layer, which is otherwise difficult for lab-based\ntechniques.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce Jointist, an instrument-aware multi-instrument\nframework that is capable of transcribing, recognizing, and separating multiple\nmusical instruments from an audio clip. Jointist consists of an instrument\nrecognition module that conditions the other two modules: a transcription\nmodule that outputs instrument-specific piano rolls, and a source separation\nmodule that utilizes instrument information and transcription results. The\njoint training of the transcription and source separation modules serves to\nimprove the performance of both tasks. The instrument module is optional and\ncan be directly controlled by human users. This makes Jointist a flexible\nuser-controllable framework. Our challenging problem formulation makes the\nmodel highly useful in the real world given that modern popular music typically\nconsists of multiple instruments. Its novelty, however, necessitates a new\nperspective on how to evaluate such a model. In our experiments, we assess the\nproposed model from various aspects, providing a new evaluation perspective for\nmulti-instrument transcription. Our subjective listening study shows that\nJointist achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular music, outperforming\nexisting multi-instrument transcription models such as MT3. We conducted\nexperiments on several downstream tasks and found that the proposed method\nimproved transcription by more than 1 percentage points (ppt.), source\nseparation by 5 SDR, downbeat detection by 1.8 ppt., chord recognition by 1.4\nppt., and key estimation by 1.4 ppt., when utilizing transcription results\nobtained from Jointist.\n  Demo available at \\url{https://jointist.github.io/Demo}.",

      "abstract": "The newly installed CALLISTO spectrometer, hosted by the Department of Space\nEnvironment, Institute of Basic and Applied Sciences- EJUST, commenced\noperation on August 14, 2021. The system contains a cross dipole\nlong-wavelength array antenna with high sensitivity to monitor solar radio\ntransients. Its antenna was strategically positioned and appeared to be in the\ncenter of the CALLISTO network of spectrometers. Moreover, in the northern\nsection of Africa, the Egypt-Alexandria CALLISTO and ALGERIA-CRAAG stations are\nthe only ones operating. There are no stations in the West African region,\nwhile stations in the eastern part of Africa are not working. Thus, Egypt-\nAlexandria station serves as a reference for other stations within the\ne-CALLISTO network. Despite the low solar activity, the instrument detected\nseveral solar radio bursts not limited to type II, type III, and type V. A\nvigorous case study was conducted on two selected radio burst events to\nvalidate the authenticity of the recorded events. Other solar radio stations at\ndifferent geographical locations recorded all the radio bursts detected by the\nspectrometer. The case study included brief analyses that indicated a type II\nradio burst observed on October 09, 2021, between 06:30 and 07:00 UT, was\nassociated with an M1.6 solar flare located at N18E08 within NOAA-AR 12882 and\na CME with a shock front speed of ~978 km/s. However, the type III radio burst\nis neither CME nor solar flare associated. These analyses examine the\ninstrument's capacity to provide real-time solar radio transient data 24 hours\na day to mitigate the challenges of data gaps faced in the African continent.\nHence, the instrument has become an integral part of space weather monitoring\nand forecasting over the region and other parts of the globe.",

      "abstract": "Annotating multi-class instances is a crucial task in the field of machine\nlearning. Unfortunately, identifying the correct class label from a long\nsequence of candidate labels is time-consuming and laborious. To alleviate this\nproblem, we design a novel labeling mechanism called stochastic label. In this\nsetting, stochastic label includes two cases: 1) identify a correct class label\nfrom a small number of randomly given labels; 2) annotate the instance with\nNone label when given labels do not contain correct class label. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel suitable approach to learn from these stochastic labels. We\nobtain an unbiased estimator that utilizes less supervised information in\nstochastic labels to train a multi-class classifier. Additionally, it is\ntheoretically justifiable by deriving the estimation error bound of the\nproposed method. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on widely-used\nbenchmark datasets to validate the superiority of our method by comparing it\nwith existing state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the covert communication in an air-to-ground (A2G)\nsystem, where a UAV (Alice) can adopt the omnidirectional microwave (OM) or\ndirectional mmWave (DM) transmission mode to transmit covert data to a ground\nuser (Bob) while suffering from the detection of an adversary (Willie). For\nboth the OM and DM modes, we first conduct theoretical analysis to reveal the\ninherent relationship between the transmit rate/transmit power and basic covert\nperformance metrics in terms of detection error probability (DEP), effective\ncovert rate (ECR), and covert Shannon capacity (CSC). To facilitate the\ntransmission mode selection at Alice, we then explore the optimization of\ntransmit rate and transmit power for ECR/CSC maximization under the OM and DM\nmodes, and further propose a hybrid OM/DM transmission mode which allows the\nUAV to adaptively select between the OM and DM modes to achieve the maximum ECR\nand CSC at a given location of UAV. Finally, extensive numerical results are\nprovided to illustrate the covert performances of the concerned A2G system\nunder different transmission modes, and demonstrate that the hybrid OM/DM\ntransmission mode outperforms the pure OM or DM mode in terms of covert\nperformance.",

      "abstract": "User behaviors on an e-commerce app not only contain different kinds of\nfeedback on items but also sometimes imply the cognitive clue of the user's\ndecision-making. For understanding the psychological procedure behind user\ndecisions, we present the behavior path and propose to match the user's current\nbehavior path with historical behavior paths to predict user behaviors on the\napp. Further, we design a deep neural network for behavior path matching and\nsolve three difficulties in modeling behavior paths: sparsity, noise\ninterference, and accurate matching of behavior paths. In particular, we\nleverage contrastive learning to augment user behavior paths, provide behavior\npath self-activation to alleviate the effect of noise, and adopt a two-level\nmatching mechanism to identify the most appropriate candidate. Our model shows\nexcellent performance on two real-world datasets, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art CTR model. Moreover, our model has been deployed on the\nMeituan food delivery platform and has accumulated 1.6% improvement in CTR and\n1.8% improvement in advertising revenue.",

The potential breaks the translation invariance of LLE.\nDepending on the existence of zeroes of the effective potential $V_\\text{eff}$,\nwhich is a suitably weighted and integrated version of $V$, we show that\nstationary solutions from $\\epsilon=0$ can be continued locally into the range\n$\\epsilon\\not =0$. Moreover, the extremal points of the $\\epsilon$-continued\nsolutions are located near zeros of $V_\\text{eff}$. We therefore call this\nphenomenon \\emph{pinning} of stationary solutions. If we assume additionally\nthat the starting stationary solution at $\\epsilon=0$ is spectrally stable with\nthe simple zero eigenvalue due to translation invariance being the only\neigenvalue on the imaginary axis, we can prove asymptotic stability or\ninstability of its $\\epsilon$-continuation depending on the sign of\n$V_\\text{eff}'$ at the zero of $V_\\text{eff}$ and the sign of $\\epsilon$.

Here, we use Zn to substitute\nCo in a broad range and perform systematic studies on\nNa$_2$Co$_{2-x}$Zn$_x$TeO$_6$ by structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic\nmeasurements, and track the doping evolution of its magnetic ground states. Due\nto the extremely close radii of Zn$^{2+}$ and high-spin Co$^{2+}$ ions, the\nsubstitution can be easily achieved. X-ray diffractions reveal no structural\ntransition but only minor changes on the lattice parameter $c$ over a wide\nsubstitution range $0 \\leq x \\leq 1.5$. Magnetic susceptibility and specific\nheat measurements both suggest an antiferromagnetic ground state which is\ngradually suppressed with doping. It can survive with $x$ up to $\\sim1.0$. Then\nit evolves into a spin-glass phase with short-range order that is rapidly\nsupplanted by a magnetically disordered state when $x \\geq 1.3$. By summarizing\nall these data, we construct a magnetic phase diagram of\nNa$_2$Co$_{2-x}$Zn$_x$TeO$_6$.

Utilising the data from the\nSoft X-ray Telescope (SXT) on-board AstroSat, we find spectral variability\nmainly caused by the variation in the X-ray column density, (N$_H$ $\\sim$\n10$^{22}$ - 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$). With the accurate spatial resolution of the\nUVIT onboard AstroSat, we separate the intrinsic AGN flux from the host galaxy\nemission and then correct for the Galactic and the internal reddening. We\ndetect no significant variation in the NUV emission over the observation\nperiod. The AGN in FUV band is undetectable due to heavy intrinsic extinction.\nFurther, the multi-wavelength IR/UV/X-ray AGN SED reveals that the AGN is in a\nlow luminosity phase with accretion rate $\\sim$ 0.01 L$_{Edd}$. The steady UV\nemission and strong X-ray absorption variability suggest that the obscuring\nclouds are likely compact and affect the compact X-ray source only and do not\npossibly cover the extended UV emitting region. In addition, the UVIT is able\nto resolve two bright spots at a radius of 7\" ($\\sim$ 6.3 Kpc) from the central\nnucleus in the South-West (SW) direction. In the UVIT image of the entire\ngalaxy, we identify UV counterparts to four Chandra identified bright X-ray\nsources. One well-known ultra-luminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 1365 X2 is\nidentified with its UV counterpart at 86\" from the nucleus in the north-east\n(NE) direction from the active nucleus.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, many researchers are focusing their attention on the subject of\nmachine translation (MT). However, Persian machine translation has remained\nunexplored despite a vast amount of research being conducted in languages with\nhigh resources, such as English. Moreover, while a substantial amount of\nresearch has been undertaken in statistical machine translation for some\ndatasets in Persian, there is currently no standard baseline for\ntransformer-based text2text models on each corpus. This study collected and\nanalysed the most popular and valuable parallel corpora, which were used for\nPersian-English translation. Furthermore, we fine-tuned and evaluated two\nstate-of-the-art attention-based seq2seq models on each dataset separately (48\nresults). We hope this paper will assist researchers in comparing their Persian\nto English and vice versa machine translation results to a standard baseline.",

In this paper we present the\ndetector and analyze observations made during one full year. After the analysis\nand correction of the GCR flux variability due to the atmospheric conditions\n(pressure and temperature), a study of the periodicities is performed in order\nto analyze modulations due to heliospheric phenomena. We can observe two\nperiods: (a) 1 day, associated with the Earth's rotation combined with the\nspatial anisotropy of the GCR flux; and (b) $\\sim$ 30 days due to solar impact\nof stable solar structures combined with the rotation of the Sun. From a\nsuperposed epoch analysis, and considering the geomagnetic effects, the mean\ndiurnal amplitude is $\\sim$ 0.08% and the maximum flux is observed in $\\sim$ 15\nhr local time (LT) direction in the interplanetary space.

      "abstract": "When allocating objects among agents with equal rights, people often evaluate\nthe fairness of an allocation rule by comparing their received utilities to a\nbenchmark share - a function only of her own valuation and the number of\nagents. This share is called a guarantee if for any profile of valuations there\nis an allocation ensuring the share of every agent. When the objects are\nindivisible goods, Budish [J. Political Econ., 2011] proposed MaxMinShare,\ni.e., the least utility of a bundle in the best partition of the objects, which\nis unfortunately not a guarantee. Instead, an earlier pioneering work by Hill\n[Ann. Probab., 1987] proposed for a share the worst-case MaxMinShare over all\nvaluations with the same largest possible single-object value. Although Hill's\nshare is more conservative than the MaxMinShare, it is an actual guarantee and\nits computation is elementary, unlike that of the MaxMinShare which involves\nsolving an NP-hard problem. We apply Hill's approach to the allocation of\nindivisible bads (objects with disutilities or costs), and characterise the\ntight closed form of the worst-case MinMaxShare for a given value of the worst\nbad. We argue that Hill's share for allocating bads is effective in the sense\nof being close to the original MinMaxShare value, and there is much to learn\nabout the guarantee an agent can be offered from the disutility of her worst\nsingle bad. Furthermore, we prove that the monotonic cover of Hill's share is\nthe best guarantee that can be achieved in Hill's model for all allocation\ninstances.",

      "abstract": "With the wide adoption of automated speech recognition (ASR) systems, it is\nincreasingly important to test and improve ASR systems. However, collecting and\nexecuting speech test cases is usually expensive and time-consuming, motivating\nus to strategically prioritize speech test cases. A key question is: how to\ndetermine the ideal order of collecting and executing speech test cases to\nuncover more errors as early as possible? Each speech test case consists of a\npiece of audio and the corresponding reference text. In this work, we propose\nPROPHET (PRiOritizing sPeecH tEsT), a tool that predicts potential\nerror-uncovering speech test cases only based on their reference texts. Thus,\nPROPHET analyzes test cases and prioritizes them without running the ASR\nsystem, which can analyze speech test cases at a large scale. We evaluate 6\ndifferent prioritization methods on 3 ASR systems and 12 datasets. Given the\nsame testing budget, we find that our approach uncovers 12.63% more wrongly\nrecognized words than the state-of-the-art method. We select test cases from\nthe prioritized list to fine-tune ASR systems and analyze how our approach can\nimprove the ASR system performance. Statistical tests show that our proposed\nmethod can bring significantly larger performance improvement to ASR systems\nthan the existing baseline methods. Furthermore, we perform correlation\nanalysis and confirm that fine-tuning an ASR system using a dataset, on which\nthe model performs worse, tends to improve the performance more.",

      "abstract": "The evil twin attack is a major security threat to WLANs. An evil twin is a\nrogue AP installed by a malicious user to impersonate legitimate APs. It\nintends to attract victims in order to intercept their credentials, to steal\ntheir sensitive information, to eavesdrop on their data, etc. In this paper, we\nstudy the security mechanisms of wireless networks and we introduce the\ndifferent authentication methods, including 802.1X authentication. We show that\n802.1X has improved security through the use of digital certificates but does\nnot define any practical technique for the user to check the network\ncertificate. Therefore, it remains vulnerable to the evil twin attack. To\nrepair this vulnerability, we introduce Robust Certificate Management System\n(RCMS) which takes advantage of the digital certificates of 802.1X to protect\nthe users against rogue APs. RCMS defines a new verification code to allow the\nuser device to check the network certificate. This practical verification\ncombined with the reliability of digital certificates provides a perfect\nprotection against rogue APs. RCMS requires a small software update on the user\nterminal and does not need any modification of IEEE 802.11. It has a\nsignificant flexibility since trusting a single AP is enough to trust all the\nAPs of the extended network. This allows the administrators to extend their\nnetworks easily without the need to update any database of trusted APs on the\nuser devices.",

      "title": "Bayesian inference for a spatio-temporal model of road traffic collision\n  data",
      "abstract": "Improving road safety is hugely important with the number of deaths on the\nworld's roads remaining unacceptably high; an estimated 1.35 million people die\neach year (WHO, 2020). Current practice for treating collision hotspots is\nalmost always reactive: once a threshold level of collisions has been exceeded\nduring some predetermined observation period, treatment is applied (e.g. road\nsafety cameras). However, more recently, methodology has been developed to\npredict collision counts at potential hotspots in future time periods, with a\nview to a more proactive treatment of road safety hotspots. Dynamic linear\nmodels provide a flexible framework for predicting collisions and thus enabling\nsuch a proactive treatment. In this paper, we demonstrate how such models can\nbe used to capture both seasonal variability and spatial dependence in time\ncourse collision rates at several locations. The model allows for within- and\nout-of-sample forecasting for locations which are fully observed and for\nlocations where some data are missing. We illustrate our approach using\ncollision rate data from 8 Traffic Administration Zones in North Florida, USA,\nand find that the model provides a good description of the underlying process\nand reasonable forecast accuracy.",

      "title": "Flag-accurate arrangements",
      "abstract": "In [MR21], the first two authors introduced the notion of an accurate\narrangement, a particular notion of freeness. In this paper, we consider a\nspecial subclass, where the property of accuracy stems from a flag of flats in\nthe intersection lattice of the underlying arrangement. Members of this family\nare called flag-accurate. One relevance of this new notion is that it entails\ndivisional freeness. There are a number of important natural classes which are\nflag-accurate, the most prominent one among them is the one consisting of\nCoxeter arrangements. This warrants a systematic study which is put forward in\nthe present paper. More specifically, let $\\mathscr A$ be a free arrangement of\nrank $\\ell$. Suppose that for every $1\\leq d \\leq \\ell$, the first $d$\nexponents of $\\mathscr A$ -- when listed in increasing order -- are realized as\nthe exponents of a free restriction of $\\mathscr A$ to some intersection of\nreflecting hyperplanes of $\\mathscr A$ of dimension $d$. Following [MR21], we\ncall such an arrangement $\\mathscr A$ with this natural property accurate. If\nin addition the flats involved can be chosen to form a flag, we call $\\mathscr\nA$ flag-accurate. We investigate flag-accuracy among reflection arrangements,\nextended Shi and extended Catalan arrangements, and further for various\nfamilies of graphic and digraphic arrangements. We pursue these both from\ntheoretical and computational perspectives. Along the way we present examples\nof accurate arrangements that are not flag-accurate. The main result of [MR21]\nshows that MAT-free arrangements are accurate. We provide strong evidence for\nthe conjecture that MAT-freeness actually entails flag-accuracy.",

Dimension zero fields are a minimal addition to the Standard Model\nof particle physics: if the Higgs doublet is emergent, they cancel the vacuum\nenergy and both Weyl anomalies without introducing any new particles.\nFurthermore, the cancellation explains why there are three generations of\nelementary particles, including RH neutrinos. We show how quantum zero point\nfluctuations of dimension zero fields seed nearly scale-invariant, Gaussian,\nadiabatic density perturbations. We calculate the amplitude of the primordial\nperturbations in terms of Standard Model couplings and find a result consistent\nwith large scale observations.

The attention surrounding\nresearch outputs, as partially captured by altmetrics, or alternative metrics,\nconstitutes many varied forms of data. Over the years 2008-2013, a set of 7739\npapers were sampled on six occasions. Five altmetric data sources were recorded\n(Twitter, Mendeley, News, Blogs and Policy) and analysed for temporal trends,\nwith particular attention being paid to their Open Access status and\ndiscipline. Twitter attention both starts and ends quickly. Mendeley readers\naccumulate quickly, and continue to grow over the following years. News and\nblog attention is quick to start, although news attention persists over a\nlonger timeframe. Citations in policy documents are slow to start, and are\nobserved to be growing over a decade after publication. Over time, growth in\nTwitter activity is confirmed, alongside an apparent decline in blogging\nattention. Mendeley usage is observed to grow, but shows signs of recent\ndecline. Policy attention is identified as the slowest form of impact studied\nby altmetrics, and one that strongly favours the Humanities and Social\nSciences.

Such an approach is\nnon-incremental, as it assumes access to all images of all categories at once.\nHowever, for many applications, non-incremental learning is unrealistic. To\nthat end, researchers study incremental learning, where a learner is required\nto adapt to an incoming stream of data with a varying distribution while\npreventing forgetting of past knowledge. Significant progress has been made,\nhowever, the vast majority of works focus on the fully supervised setting,\nmaking these algorithms label-hungry thus limiting their real-life deployment.\nTo that end, in this paper, we make the first attempt to survey recently\ngrowing interest in label-efficient incremental learning. We identify three\nsubdivisions, namely semi-, few-shot- and self-supervised learning to reduce\nlabeling efforts. Finally, we identify novel directions that can further\nenhance label-efficiency and improve incremental learning scalability. Project\nwebsite: https://github.com/kilickaya/label-efficient-il.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel memory-enabled non-uniform sampling-based\nbumblebee foraging algorithm (MEB) designed for optimal channel selection in a\ndistributed Vehicular Dynamic Spectrum Access (VDSA) framework employed in a\nplatoon operating environment. Given how bumblebee behavioral models are\ndesigned to support adaptation in complex and highly time-varying environments,\nthese models can be employed by connected vehicles to enable their operation\nwithin a dynamically changing network topology and support their selection of\noptimal channels possessing low levels of congestion to achieve high\nthroughput. As a result, the proposed VDSA-based optimal channel selection\nemploys fundamental concepts from the bumblebee foraging model. In the proposed\napproach, the Channel Busy Ratio (CBR) of all channels is computed and stored\nin memory to be accessed by the MEB algorithm to make the necessary channel\nswitching decisions. Two averaging techniques, Sliding Window Average (SWA) and\nExponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), are employed to leverage past\nsamples and are evaluated against the no-memory case. Due to the high\nvariability of the environment (e.g., high velocities, changing density of\nvehicles on the road), we propose to calculate the CBR by employing non-uniform\nchannel sampling allocations as well as evaluate it using both simplified\nnumerical and realistic Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) computer simulations. The\nnumerical simulation results show that gains in the probability of the best\nchannel selection can be achieved relative to a uniform sampling allocation\napproach. By utilizing memory, we observe an additional increase in the channel\nselection performance. Similarly, we see an increase in the probability of\nsuccessful reception when utilizing the bumblebee algorithm via a system-level\nsimulator.",

      "abstract": "Up to date, only 6 imines have been detected in the interstellar medium. The\n3-carbon imine, 2-propanimine ((CH$_3$)$_2$C=NH), is predicted to be the\nstructural isomer with the lowest energy in the C$_3$H$_7$N group, and appears\nto be a good candidate for astronomical searches. Unexpectedly, no microwave or\nmillimeter wave spectrum is available for 2-propanimine. In this work, we\nprovide the first high resolution millimeter wave spectrum of 2-propanimine and\nits analysis. With the guide of this laboratory measurement, we aim to search\nfor 2-propanimine in two molecule-rich sources Sgr B2(N) and IRAS 16293-2422\nusing observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA). Starting from a synthesized sample, we measured the spectrum of\n2-propanimine from 50 to 500 GHz, and the ground state lines are successfully\nassigned and fitted using XIAM and ERHAM programs with the aid of theoretical\ncalculations. The barriers to internal rotation of the two CH$_3$ tops are\ndetermined to be 531.956(64) cm$^{-1}$ and 465.013(26) cm$^{-1}$. These data\nare able to provide reliable prediction of transition frequencies for\nastronomical search. Although a few line matches exist, no confirmed detection\nof 2-propanimine has been found in the hot molecular core Sgr B2(N1S) and the\nClass 0 protostar IRAS 16293B. Upper-limits of its column density have been\nderived, and indicate that 2-propanimine is at least 18 times less abundant\nthan methanimine in Sgr B2(N1S), and is at most 50-83 % of methanimine in IRAS\n16293B.",

In this paper, we\nlook for optimal sub-networks and investigate the capability of different\ntransformer modules in transferring knowledge from a pre-trained model to a\ndownstream task. Our empirical results suggest that every transformer module in\nBERT can act as a winning ticket: fine-tuning each specific module while\nkeeping the rest of the network frozen can lead to comparable performance to\nthe full fine-tuning. Among different modules, LayerNorms exhibit the best\ncapacity for knowledge transfer with limited trainable weights, to the extent\nthat, with only 0.003% of all parameters in the layer-wise analysis, they show\nacceptable performance on various target tasks. On the reasons behind their\neffectiveness, we argue that their notable performance could be attributed to\ntheir high-magnitude weights compared to that of the other modules in the\npre-trained BERT.",

      "abstract": "Electronic transitions in molecules due to the absorption or emission of\nlight is a complex quantum mechanical process. Their study plays an important\nrole in the design of novel materials. A common yet challenging task in the\nstudy is to determine the nature of electronic transitions, namely which\nsubgroups of the molecule are involved in the transition by donating or\naccepting electrons, followed by an investigation of the variation in the\ndonor-acceptor behavior for different transitions or conformations of the\nmolecules. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the analysis of a\nbivariate field and show its applicability to the study of electronic\ntransitions. This approach is based on two novel operators, the continuous\nscatterplot (CSP) lens operator and the CSP peel operator, that enable\neffective visual analysis of bivariate fields. Both operators can be applied\nindependently or together to facilitate analysis. The operators motivate the\ndesign of control polygon inputs to extract fiber surfaces of interest in the\nspatial domain. The CSPs are annotated with a quantitative measure to further\nsupport the visual analysis. We study different molecular systems and\ndemonstrate how the CSP peel and CSP lens operators help identify and study\ndonor and acceptor characteristics in molecular systems.",

The main idea thereby\nlies in treating the zeroth mode exactly within the discretization. For\nlong-time error estimates, we rigorously establish the long-time error bounds\nof different low-regularity integrators for the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation (NLSE) with small initial data characterized by a dimensionless\nparameter $\\varepsilon \\in (0, 1]$. We begin with the low-regularity integrator\nfor the quadratic NLSE in which the integral is computed exactly and the\nimproved uniform first-order convergence in $H^r$ is proven at $O(\\varepsilon\n\\tau)$ for solutions in $H^r$ with $r > 1/2$ up to the time $T_{\\varepsilon } =\nT/\\varepsilon $ with fixed $T > 0$. Then, the improved uniform long-time error\nbound is extended to a symmetric second-order low-regularity integrator in the\nlong-time regime. For the cubic NLSE, we design new non-resonant first-order\nand symmetric second-order low-regularity integrators which treat the zeroth\nmode exactly and rigorously carry out the error analysis up to the time\n$T_{\\varepsilon } = T/\\varepsilon ^2$. With the help of the regularity\ncompensation oscillation (RCO) technique, the improved uniform error bounds are\nestablished for the new non-resonant low-regularity schemes, which further\nreduce the long-time error by a factor of $\\varepsilon^2$ compared with\nclassical low-regularity integrators for the cubic NLSE.

      "abstract": "Black box optimisation of an unknown function from expensive and noisy\nevaluations is a ubiquitous problem in machine learning, academic research and\nindustrial production. An abstraction of the problem can be formulated as a\nkernel based bandit problem (also known as Bayesian optimisation), where a\nlearner aims at optimising a kernelized function through sequential noisy\nobservations. The existing work predominantly assumes feedback is immediately\navailable; an assumption which fails in many real world situations, including\nrecommendation systems, clinical trials and hyperparameter tuning. We consider\na kernel bandit problem under stochastically delayed feedback, and propose an\nalgorithm with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{\\Gamma_k(T)T}+\\mathbb{E}[\\tau])$\nregret, where $T$ is the number of time steps, $\\Gamma_k(T)$ is the maximum\ninformation gain of the kernel with $T$ observations, and $\\tau$ is the delay\nrandom variable. This represents a significant improvement over the state of\nthe art regret bound of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\Gamma_k(T)\\sqrt{T}+\\mathbb{E}[\\tau]\\Gamma_k(T))$ reported\nin Verma et al. (2022). In particular, for very non-smooth kernels, the\ninformation gain grows almost linearly in time, trivializing the existing\nresults. We also validate our theoretical results with simulations.",

      "abstract": "In defect prediction community, many defect prediction models have been\nproposed and indeed more new models are continuously being developed. However,\nthere is no consensus on how to evaluate the performance of a newly proposed\nmodel. In this paper, we aim to propose MATTER, a fraMework towArd a consisTenT\npErformance compaRison, which makes model performance directly comparable\nacross different studies. We take three actions to build a consistent\nevaluation framework for defect prediction models. First, we propose a simple\nand easy-to-use unsupervised baseline model ONE (glObal baseliNe modEl) to\nprovide \"a single point of comparison\". Second, we propose using the\nSQA-effort-aligned threshold setting to make a fair comparison. Third, we\nsuggest reporting the evaluation results in a unified way and provide a set of\ncore performance indicators for this purpose, thus enabling an across-study\ncomparison to attain real progress. The experimental results show that MATTER\ncan serve as an effective framework to support a consistent performance\nevaluation for defect prediction models and hence can help determine whether a\nnewly proposed defect prediction model is practically useful for practitioners\nand inform the real progress in the road of defect prediction. Furthermore,\nwhen applying MATTER to evaluate the representative defect prediction models\nproposed in recent years, we find that most of them (if not all) are not\nsuperior to the simple baseline model ONE in terms of the SQA-effort awareness\nprediction performance. This reveals that the real progress in defect\nprediction has been overestimated. We hence recommend that, in future studies,\nwhen any new defect prediction model is proposed, MATTER should be used to\nevaluate its actual usefulness (on the same benchmark test data sets) to\nadvance scientific progress in defect prediction.",

Building on these advances, companies have\nidentified various application scenarios, where the automated processing of\nhuman language can help foster task efficiency. To this end, the use of\nchatbots may not only decrease costs, but it is also said to boost user\nsatisfaction.

Particularly trust and\nrespective task satisfaction count as relevant usage predictors. In this paper,\nwe thus present work that aims to shed some light on these two variable\nconstructs. We report on an experimental study ($n=277$), investigating four\ndifferent human-chatbot interaction tasks. After each task, participants were\nasked to complete survey items on perceived trust, perceived task complexity\nand perceived task satisfaction. Results show that task complexity impacts\nnegatively on both trust and satisfaction.

The goal is to identify the best stars with\nwhich to test whether the fine-structure constant, alpha, varies with dark\nmatter density in our Galaxy. Here we use EPIC, our line-by-line differential\ntechnique, to measure the stellar parameters - effective temperature Teff,\nsurface gravity log g, metallicity [Fe/H] - from moderate resolution (R <\n32,000) spectra of 877 solar twin and analogue candidates (547 at 1-4 kpc)\nobserved with the HERMES spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. These\nare consistent with expectations for Teff and log g from photometry, and for\n[Fe/H] from the Besancon stellar population model. EPIC provides small enough\nuncertainties (~90 K, 0.08 dex, 0.05 dex, respectively), even at the low\nsignal-to-noise ratios available (S/N >~ 25 per pixel), to identify 299 new\nsolar analogues (> 90% confidence), and 20 solar twins (>50% confidence), 206\nand 12 of which are at 1-4 kpc. By extending EPIC to measure line broadening\nand lithium abundance from HERMES spectra, and with ages derived from isochrone\nfitting with our stellar parameters, we identify 174 solar analogues at 1-4 kpc\nwhich are relatively inactive, slowly rotating, and with no evidence of\nspectroscopic binarity.

This problem can be seen as a natural generalization\nof the widely studied random features model to deeper architectures. First, we\nprove Gaussian universality of the test error in a ridge regression setting\nwhere the learner and target networks share the same intermediate layers, and\nprovide a sharp asymptotic formula for it. Establishing this result requires\nproving a deterministic equivalent for traces of the deep random features\nsample covariance matrices which can be of independent interest. Second, we\nconjecture the asymptotic Gaussian universality of the test error in the more\ngeneral setting of arbitrary convex losses and generic learner/target\narchitectures.

      "abstract": "In consumer theory, ranking available objects by means of preference\nrelations yields the most common description of individual choices. However,\npreference-based models assume that individuals: (1) give their preferences\nonly between pairs of objects; (2) are always able to pick the best preferred\nobject. In many situations, they may be instead choosing out of a set with more\nthan two elements and, because of lack of information and/or incomparability\n(objects with contradictory characteristics), they may not able to select a\nsingle most preferred object. To address these situations, we need a\nchoice-model which allows an individual to express a set-valued choice. Choice\nfunctions provide such a mathematical framework. We propose a Gaussian Process\nmodel to learn choice functions from choice-data.

      "abstract": "Given only a set of images, neural implicit surface representation has shown\nits capability in 3D surface reconstruction. However, as the nature of\nper-scene optimization is based on the volumetric rendering of color, previous\nneural implicit surface reconstruction methods usually fail in low-textured\nregions, including the floors, walls, etc., which commonly exist for indoor\nscenes. Being aware of the fact that these low-textured regions usually\ncorrespond to planes, without introducing additional ground-truth supervisory\nsignals or making additional assumptions about the room layout, we propose to\nleverage a novel Pseudo Plane-regularized Signed Distance Field (P$^2$SDF) for\nindoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we consider adjacent pixels with\nsimilar colors to be on the same pseudo planes. The plane parameters are then\nestimated on the fly during training by an efficient and effective two-step\nscheme. Then the signed distances of the points on the planes are regularized\nby the estimated plane parameters in the training phase. As the unsupervised\nplane segments are usually noisy and inaccurate, we propose to assign different\nweights to the sampled points on the plane in plane estimation as well as the\nregularization loss. The weights come by fusing the plane segments from\ndifferent views. As the sampled rays in the planar regions are redundant,\nleading to inefficient training, we further propose a keypoint-guided rays\nsampling strategy that attends to the informative textured regions with large\ncolor variations, and the implicit network gets a better reconstruction,\ncompared with the original uniform ray sampling strategy. Experiments show that\nour P$^2$SDF achieves competitive reconstruction performance in Manhattan\nscenes. Further, as we do not introduce any additional room layout assumption,\nour P$^2$SDF generalizes well to the reconstruction of non-Manhattan scenes.",

      "abstract": "Atom-interferometer gyroscopes have attracted much attention for their\npotential superior long-term stability and extremely low drift. For such high\nprecision instrument, a self-calibration to achieve an absolute rotation\nmeasurement is highly demanded. Here we propose and demonstrate a\nself-calibration of the atomic gyroscope. The calibration is realized by using\nthe detuning of laser frequency to control the atomic velocity thus to modulate\nthe scale factor of the gyroscope. The modulation determines the order and the\ninitial phase of the interference stripe, thus eliminates the ambiguity caused\nby the periodicity of the interferometric signal. The calibration method is\nverified by measuring the Earth's rotation. Long-term stable and\nself-calibrated atom-interferometer gyros can find important applications in\nthe fields of fundamental physics and long-time navigation.",

Drug repurposing is a promising option for drug\ndiscovery due to its reduced cost and expedited approval procedures.\nComputational approaches based on machine learning enable the rapid screening\nof DrugBank compounds, identifying those with the potential to be repurposed\nfor OUD treatment. We collected inhibitor data for four major opioid receptors\nand used advanced machine learning predictors of binding affinity that fuse the\ngradient boosting decision tree algorithm with two natural language processing\n(NLP)-based molecular fingerprints and one traditional 2D fingerprint. Using\nthese predictors, we systematically analyzed the binding affinities of DrugBank\ncompounds on four opioid receptors. Based on our machine learning predictions,\nwe were able to discriminate DrugBank compounds with various binding affinity\nthresholds and selectivities for different receptors. The prediction results\nwere further analyzed for ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism,\nexcretion, and toxicity), which provided guidance on repurposing DrugBank\ncompounds for the inhibition of selected opioid receptors. The pharmacological\neffects of these compounds for OUD treatment need to be tested in further\nexperimental studies and clinical trials.

      "abstract": "Sequential Recommendation is a widely studied paradigm for learning users'\ndynamic interests from historical interactions for predicting the next\npotential item. Although lots of research work has achieved remarkable\nprogress, they are still plagued by the common issues: data sparsity of limited\nsupervised signals and data noise of accidentally clicking. To this end,\nseveral works have attempted to address these issues, which ignored the complex\nassociation of items across several sequences. Along this line, with the aim of\nlearning representative item embedding to alleviate this dilemma, we propose\nGUESR, from the view of graph contrastive learning. Specifically, we first\nconstruct the Global Item Relationship Graph (GIRG) from all interaction\nsequences and present the Bucket-Cluster Sampling (BCS) method to conduct the\nsub-graphs. Then, graph contrastive learning on this reduced graph is developed\nto enhance item representations with complex associations from the global view.\nWe subsequently extend the CapsNet module with the elaborately introduced\ntarget-attention mechanism to derive users' dynamic preferences. Extensive\nexperimental results have demonstrated our proposed GUESR could not only\nachieve significant improvements but also could be regarded as a general\nenhancement strategy to improve the performance in combination with other\nsequential recommendation methods.",

      "abstract": "Existing 3D instance segmentation methods are predominated by the bottom-up\ndesign -- manually fine-tuned algorithm to group points into clusters followed\nby a refinement network. However, by relying on the quality of the clusters,\nthese methods generate susceptible results when (1) nearby objects with the\nsame semantic class are packed together, or (2) large objects with loosely\nconnected regions. To address these limitations, we introduce ISBNet, a novel\ncluster-free method that represents instances as kernels and decodes instance\nmasks via dynamic convolution. To efficiently generate high-recall and\ndiscriminative kernels, we propose a simple strategy named Instance-aware\nFarthest Point Sampling to sample candidates and leverage the local aggregation\nlayer inspired by PointNet++ to encode candidate features. Moreover, we show\nthat predicting and leveraging the 3D axis-aligned bounding boxes in the\ndynamic convolution further boosts performance.

The radio frequency (RF)\ngenerator is an indispensable component to control lasers and then manipulate\natoms. We developed a highly compact RF generator for fast switching and\nsweeping frequencies/amplitudes of atomic interference pulse sequences.\nMulti-channel RF signals are generated by using a field-programmable gate array\n(FPGA) to control eight direct digital synthesizers (DDSs). We further proposed\nand demonstrated a method of preloading the parameters of all RF pulse\nsequences to the DDS registers before the execution of the pulse sequences,\nwhich eliminates the data transfer between the FPGA and DDSs to change RF\nsignals and thus sharply shortens the delay of frequency switching when the\npulse sequences are running. The characterized performance shows the generated\nRF signals achieve 119 ns frequency switching delay, and 40 dB harmonic\nrejection ratio. The generated RF pulse sequences are applied to a cold\natom-interferometer gyroscope, and the contrast of atomic interference fringes\nreaches 38%.

To deal with this\nproblem, we propose a novel framework called Slack Federated Adversarial\nTraining (SFAT), assigning the client-wise slack during aggregation to combat\nthe intensified heterogeneity.

Our main\nresults show hardness for both these problems in a restricted-but-powerful\nclass of algorithms based on computing low-degree polynomials in the inputs.\n  The problem of recovering a planted $q$-coloring is equivalent to recovering\n$q$ disjoint planted cliques that cover all the vertices -- a potentially\neasier variant of the well-studied planted clique problem. Our first result\nshows that this variant is as hard as the original planted clique problem in\nthe low-degree polynomial model of computation: each clique needs to have size\n$k \\gg \\sqrt{n}$ for efficient recovery to be possible. For the related variant\nwhere the cliques cover a $(1-\\epsilon)$-fraction of the vertices, we also show\nhardness by reduction from planted clique.\n  Our second result shows that refuting $q$-colorability of $G(n,1/2)$ is hard\nin the low-degree polynomial model when $q \\gg n^{2/3}$ but easy when $q\n\\lesssim n^{1/2}$, and we leave closing this gap for future work. Our proof is\nmore subtle than similar results for planted clique and involves constructing a\nnon-standard distribution over $q$-colorable graphs. We note that while related\nto several prior works, this is the first work that explicitly formulates\nrefutation problems in the low-degree polynomial model.\n  The proofs of our main results involve showing low-degree hardness of\nhypothesis testing between an appropriately constructed pair of distributions.\nFor refutation, we show completeness of this approach: in the low-degree model,\nthe refutation task is precisely as hard as the hardest associated testing\nproblem, i.e., proving hardness of refutation amounts to finding a \"hard\"\ndistribution.",

      "abstract": "Holomorphic functions play a crucial role in operator theory and the Cauchy\nformula is a very important tool to define functions of operators. The\nFueter-Sce-Qian extension theorem is a two steps procedure to extend\nholomorphic functions to the hyperholomorphic setting. The first step gives the\nclass of slice hyperholomorphic functions; their Cauchy formula allows to\ndefine the so-called $S$-functional calculus for noncommuting operators based\non the $S$-spectrum. In the second step this extension procedure generates\nmonogenic functions; the related monogenic functional calculus, based on the\nmonogenic spectrum, contains the Weyl functional calculus as a particular case.\nIn this paper we show that the extension operator from slice hyperholomorphic\nfunctions to monogenic functions admits various possible factorizations that\ninduce different function spaces. The integral representations in such spaces\nallows to define the associated functional calculi based on the $S$-spectrum.\nThe function spaces and the associated functional calculi define the so called\n{\\em fine structure of the spectral theories on the $S$-spectrum}. Among the\npossible fine structures there are the harmonic and poly-harmonic functions and\nthe associated harmonic and poly-harmonic functional calculi. The study of the\nfine structures depends on the dimension considered and in this paper we study\nin detail the case of dimension five, and we describe all of them. The\nfive-dimensional case is of crucial importance because it allows to determine\nalmost all the function spaces will also appear in dimension greater than five,\nbut with different orders.",

We identify several types of structural defects and find that\nmost have a local character limited to the single CDW site, with single\nexception which effectively behaves as a dopant, leading to band bending and\naffecting multiple neighboring sites. While only one type of defect can be\nobserved by STM topographic imaging, all defects are easily resolved by local\ndensity of states (LDOS) mapping with STS. We correlate atomically-resolved STM\nperiodicity of defect-free 1T-TaS2 to top sulfur atoms and introduce tiling of\nthe surface using equiangular hexagon. DFT calculations (with included Coulomb\ninteractions) are used to investigate the electronic structure by introducing\nsulfur vacancy or substituting sulfur with oxygen. The sulfur vacancy is\ncharacterized by metallic properties and is identified as an origin of one of\nobserved experimentally defects. Whereas in the case of the latter, the\noxidation of 1T-TaS2 is found to result in the loss of magnetic properties\nexpected in defect-free material.",

However, it is\nnon-trivial to learn the optimal moment among many possible moments of starting\ntranslating, as the moments of starting translating always hide inside the\nmodel and can only be supervised with the observed target sequence. In this\npaper, we propose a Hidden Markov Transformer (HMT), which treats the moments\nof starting translating as hidden events and the target sequence as the\ncorresponding observed events, thereby organizing them as a hidden Markov\nmodel. HMT explicitly models multiple moments of starting translating as the\ncandidate hidden events, and then selects one to generate the target token.\nDuring training, by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the target sequence\nover multiple moments of starting translating, HMT learns to start translating\nat the moments that target tokens can be generated more accurately.

In\nthis letter, we study a double-RIS aided downlink multi-user multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) communication system. We investigate the\nmean-square-error (MSE) minimization problem by jointly optimizing the active\ntransmit beamforming, the receive equalizer and the passive beamforming at each\nRIS. Different from prior works, for the sake of reducing both communication\noverhead and signal processing complexity, we assume that the two RISs utilize\nthe common reflection pattern. Under this assumption, the coupling of the\nvariables becomes tighter, thereby making the optimization problem more\nchallenging to solve. To effectively address this issue, we propose a\nmajorization-minimization (MM)-based alternating optimization (AO)\nalgorithm.Numerical results show that in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nregion, the double-RIS with common reflection pattern can achieve nearly the\nsame performance as that with separate reflection pattern whereas the\ncomplexity is only half of the latter.

      "abstract": "The performance of convolutional neural networks (CNN) depends heavily on\ntheir architectures. Transfer learning performance of a CNN relies quite\nstrongly on selection of its trainable layers. Selecting the most effective\nupdate layers for a certain target dataset often requires expert knowledge on\nCNN architecture which many practitioners do not posses. General users prefer\nto use an available architecture (e.g. GoogleNet, ResNet, EfficientNet etc.)\nthat is developed by domain experts. With the ever-growing number of layers, it\nis increasingly becoming quite difficult and cumbersome to handpick the update\nlayers. Therefore, in this paper we explore the application of genetic\nalgorithm to mitigate this problem. The convolutional layers of popular\npretrained networks are often grouped into modules that constitute their\nbuilding blocks. We devise a genetic algorithm to select blocks of layers for\nupdating the parameters. By experimenting with EfficientNetB0 pre-trained on\nImageNet and using Food-101, CIFAR-100 and MangoLeafBD as target datasets, we\nshow that our algorithm yields similar or better results than the baseline in\nterms of accuracy, and requires lower training and evaluation time due to\nlearning less number of parameters. We also devise a metric called block\nimportance to measure efficacy of each block as update block and analyze the\nimportance of the blocks selected by our algorithm.",

      "abstract": "The scarcity of labeled far-field speech is a constraint for training\nsuperior far-field speaker verification systems. Fine-tuning the model\npre-trained on large-scale near-field speech substantially outperforms training\nfrom scratch. However, the fine-tuning method suffers from two\nlimitations--catastrophic forgetting and overfitting. In this paper, we propose\na weight transfer regularization(WTR) loss to constrain the distance of the\nweights between the pre-trained model with large-scale near-field speech and\nthe fine-tuned model through a small number of far-field speech. With the WTR\nloss, the fine-tuning process takes advantage of the previously acquired\ndiscriminative ability from the large-scale near-field speech without\ncatastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, we use the PAC-Bayes generalization theory\nto analyze the generalization bound of the fine-tuned model with the WTR loss.\nThe analysis result indicates that the WTR term makes the fine-tuned model have\na tighter generalization upper bound. Moreover, we explore three kinds of norm\ndistance for weight transfer, which are L1-norm distance, L2-norm distance and\nMax-norm distance.

Due\nto resource constrained nature of nodes in the IoT, RPL is vulnerable to many\nattacks that consume the node's resources and degrade the network's\nperformance. In this paper, we present a study on various attacks and their\nexisting defense solutions, particularly to RPL. Open research issues,\nchallenges, and future directions specific to RPL security are also discussed.\nA taxonomy of RPL attacks, considering the essential attributes like resources,\ntopology, and traffic, is shown for better understanding.

      "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) holds promise to efficiently produce metal\nparts. However, LPBF incurs stochastic melt pool (MP) spattering, which would\nroughen workpiece in-process surface, thus weakening inter-layer bonding and\ncausing issues like porosity, powder contamination, and recoater intervention.\nUnderstanding the consequential effect of MP spattering on layer surface\nremains difficult due to the lack of process monitoring capability for\nconcurrently tracking MP spatters and characterizing layer surfaces. In this\nwork, using our lab-designed LPBF-specific fringe projection profilometry and\nan off-axis camera, we quantify the correlation between MP spattering and\nin-process layer surface roughness for the first time to reveal the influence\nof MP spatters on process anomaly and part defects. A method of extracting and\nregistering MP spattering metrics is developed by machine learning of the\nin-situ imaging data. Each image is analyzed to obtain the MP center location\nand the spatter count and ejection angle. These MP spatter signatures are\nregistered for each monitored MP across each layer. Regression modeling is used\nto correlate registered MP spatter signature and its processing parameters with\nlayer surface topography measured by the in-situ FPP. We find that the attained\nMP spatter feature profile can help predict the layer surface roughness more\naccurately (> 50% less error), in contrast to the conventional approaches that\nwould only use nominal process setting. This is because the spatter information\ncan reflect key process changes including the deviations in actual laser scan\nparameters and their effects. The results corroborate the importance of spatter\nmonitoring and the distinct influence of spattering on layer surface roughness.\nOur work paves a foundation to thoroughly elucidate and effectively control the\nrole of MP spattering in defect formation during LPBF.",

      "abstract": "Recommender system is an essential part of online services, especially for\ne-commerce platform. Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction in RS plays a significant\nrole in optimizing Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) goal of e-commerce. However,\nCVR suffers from well-known Sample Selection Bias (SSB) and Data Sparsity (DS)\nproblems. Although existing methods ESMM and ESM2 train with all impression\nsamples over the entire space by modeling user behavior paths, SSB and DS\nproblems still exist. In real practice, the online inference space are samples\nfrom previous stage of RS process, rather than the impression space modeled by\nexisting methods. Moreover, existing methods solve the DS problem mainly by\nbuilding behavior paths of their own specific scene, ignoring the behaviors in\nvarious scenes of e-commerce platform. In this paper, we propose Entire Space\nLearning Framework: Unbias Conversion Rate Prediction in Full Stages of\nRecommender System, solving SSB and DS problems by reformulating GMV goal in a\nnovel manner. Specifically, we rebuild the CVR on the entire data space with\nsamples from previous stage of RS process, unifying training and online\ninference space. Moreover, we explicitly introduce purchase samples from other\nscenes of e-commerce platform in model learning process. Online A/B test and\noffline experiments show the superiority of our framework.

Moreover, we identify a separate invariant manifold which corresponds\nto a zero limiting eccentricity vector. This manifold is obtained as a\ngeneralized center manifold over the zero eigenspace of a zero-Hopf point.\nFinally, we present a detailed blowup analysis, which provides a geometric\npicture of the dynamics. %We will use this to shed light on a degenerate case\nof the limiting eccentricity vector. %The aforementioned invariant manifolds\nonly make up a subset hereof.

      "abstract": "Modern object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which may\nbring risks to real-world applications. The sparse attack is an important task\nwhich, compared with the popular adversarial perturbation on the whole image,\nneeds to select the potential pixels that is generally regularized by an\n$\\ell_0$-norm constraint, and simultaneously optimize the corresponding\ntexture. The non-differentiability of $\\ell_0$ norm brings challenges and many\nworks on attacking object detection adopted manually-designed patterns to\naddress them, which are meaningless and independent of objects, and therefore\nlead to relatively poor attack performance.\n  In this paper, we propose Adversarial Semantic Contour (ASC), an MAP estimate\nof a Bayesian formulation of sparse attack with a deceived prior of object\ncontour. The object contour prior effectively reduces the search space of pixel\nselection and improves the attack by introducing more semantic bias. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that ASC can corrupt the prediction of 9 modern\ndetectors with different architectures (\\e.g., one-stage, two-stage and\nTransformer) by modifying fewer than 5\\% of the pixels of the object area in\nCOCO in white-box scenario and around 10\\% of those in black-box scenario. We\nfurther extend the attack to datasets for autonomous driving systems to verify\nthe effectiveness. We conclude with cautions about contour being the common\nweakness of object detectors with various architecture and the care needed in\napplying them in safety-sensitive scenarios.",

      "abstract": "mRNA therapy is gaining worldwide attention as an emerging therapeutic\napproach. The widespread use of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 outbreak has\ndemonstrated the potential of mRNA therapy. As mRNA-based drugs have expanded\nand their indications have broadened, more patents for mRNA innovations have\nemerged. The global patent landscape for mRNA therapy has not yet been\nanalyzed, indicating a research gap in need of filling, from new technology to\nproductization. This study uses social network analysis with the patent quality\nassessment to investigate the temporal trends, citation relationship, and\nsignificant litigation for 16,101 mRNA therapy patents and summarizes the hot\ntopics and potential future directions for this industry. The information\nobtained in this study not only may be utilized as a tool of knowledge for\nresearchers in a comprehensive and integrated way but can also provide\ninspiration for efficient production methods for mRNA drugs. This study shows\nthat infectious diseases and cancer are currently the primary applications for\nmRNA drugs. Emerging patent activity and lawsuits in this field are\ndemonstrating that delivery technology remains one of the key challenges in the\nfield and that drug-targeting research in combination with vector technology\nwill be one of the major directions for the industry going forward. With\nsignificant funding, new organizations have developed novel delivery\ntechnologies in an attempt to break into the patent thicket established by\ncompanies such as Arbutus.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present StrucTexTv2, an effective document image\npre-training framework, by performing masked visual-textual prediction. It\nconsists of two self-supervised pre-training tasks: masked image modeling and\nmasked language modeling, based on text region-level image masking. The\nproposed method randomly masks some image regions according to the bounding box\ncoordinates of text words. The objectives of our pre-training tasks are\nreconstructing the pixels of masked image regions and the corresponding masked\ntokens simultaneously. Hence the pre-trained encoder can capture more textual\nsemantics in comparison to the masked image modeling that usually predicts the\nmasked image patches. Compared to the masked multi-modal modeling methods for\ndocument image understanding that rely on both the image and text modalities,\nStrucTexTv2 models image-only input and potentially deals with more application\nscenarios free from OCR pre-processing. Extensive experiments on mainstream\nbenchmarks of document image understanding demonstrate the effectiveness of\nStrucTexTv2. It achieves competitive or even new state-of-the-art performance\nin various downstream tasks such as image classification, layout analysis,\ntable structure recognition, document OCR, and information extraction under the\nend-to-end scenario.",

      "abstract": "Recognizing already explored places (a.k.a. place recognition) is a\nfundamental task in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to enable\nrobot relocalization and loop closure detection. In topological SLAM the\nrecognition takes place by comparing a signature (or feature vector) associated\nto the current node with the signatures of the nodes in the known map. However,\nas the number of nodes increases, matching the current node signature against\nall the existing ones becomes inefficient and thwarts real-time navigation. In\nthis paper we propose a novel approach to pre-select a subset of map nodes for\nplace recognition. The map nodes are clustered during exploration and each\ncluster is associated with a region. The region labels become the prediction\ntargets of a deep neural network and, during navigation, only the nodes\nassociated with the regions predicted with high probability are considered for\nmatching. While the proposed technique can be integrated in different SLAM\napproaches, in this work we describe an effective integration with RTAB-Map (a\npopular framework for real-time topological SLAM) which allowed us to design\nand run several experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness.

      "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel method to estimate 3D human pose and shape\nfrom monocular videos. This task requires directly recovering pixel-alignment\n3D human pose and body shape from monocular images or videos, which is\nchallenging due to its inherent ambiguity. To improve precision, existing\nmethods highly rely on the initialized mean pose and shape as prior estimates\nand parameter regression with an iterative error feedback manner. In addition,\nvideo-based approaches model the overall change over the image-level features\nto temporally enhance the single-frame feature, but fail to capture the\nrotational motion at the joint level, and cannot guarantee local temporal\nconsistency. To address these issues, we propose a novel Transformer-based\nmodel with a design of independent tokens. First, we introduce three types of\ntokens independent of the image feature: \\textit{joint rotation tokens, shape\ntoken, and camera token}. By progressively interacting with image features\nthrough Transformer layers, these tokens learn to encode the prior knowledge of\nhuman 3D joint rotations, body shape, and position information from large-scale\ndata, and are updated to estimate SMPL parameters conditioned on a given image.\nSecond, benefiting from the proposed token-based representation, we further use\na temporal model to focus on capturing the rotational temporal information of\neach joint, which is empirically conducive to preventing large jitters in local\nparts. Despite being conceptually simple, the proposed method attains superior\nperformances on the 3DPW and Human3.6M datasets. Using ResNet-50 and\nTransformer architectures, it obtains 42.0 mm error on the PA-MPJPE metric of\nthe challenging 3DPW, outperforming state-of-the-art counterparts by a large\nmargin.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a new refinement-free and end-to-end building footprint extraction\nmethod, which is conceptually intuitive, simple, and effective. Our method,\ntermed as BiSVP, represents a building instance with ordered vertices and\nformulates the building footprint extraction as predicting the serialized\nvertices directly in a bidirectional fashion. Moreover, we propose a\ncross-scale feature fusion (CSFF) module to facilitate high resolution and rich\nsemantic feature learning, which is essential for the dense building vertex\nprediction task. Without bells and whistles, our BiSVP outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by considerable margins on three building instance\nsegmentation benchmarks, clearly demonstrating its superiority.

      "title": "The Inversive Relationship Between Bugs and Patches: An Empirical Study",
      "abstract": "Software bugs pose an ever-present concern for developers, and patching such\nbugs requires a considerable amount of costs through complex operations. In\ncontrast, introducing bugs can be an effortless job, in that even a simple\nmutation can easily break the Program Under Test (PUT). Existing research has\nconsidered these two opposed activities largely separately, either trying to\nautomatically generate realistic patches to help developers, or to find\nrealistic bugs to simulate and prevent future defects. Despite the fundamental\ndifferences between them, however, we hypothesise that they do not\nsyntactically differ from each other when considered simply as code changes. To\nexamine this assumption systematically, we investigate the relationship between\npatches and buggy commits, both generated manually and automatically, using a\nclustering and pattern analysis. A large scale empirical evaluation reveals\nthat up to 70% of patches and faults can be clustered together based on the\nsimilarity between their lexical patterns; further, 44% of the code changes can\nbe abstracted into the identical change patterns. Moreover, we investigate\nwhether code mutation tools can be used as Automated Program Repair (APR)\ntools, and APR tools as code mutation tools. In both cases, the inverted use of\nmutation and APR tools can perform surprisingly well, or even better, when\ncompared to their original, intended uses. For example, 89% of patches found by\nSequenceR, a deep learning based APR tool, can also be found by its inversion,\ni.e., a model trained with faults and not patches. Similarly, real fault\ncoupling study of mutants reveals that TBar, a template based APR tool, can\ngenerate 14% and 3% more fault couplings than traditional mutation tools, PIT\nand Major respectively, when used as a mutation tool.",

      "abstract": "Modelling elastocaloric effect (eCE) is crucial for the design of\nenvironmentally friendly and energy-efficient eCE based solid-state cooling\ndevices. Here, a thermodynamically consistent non-isothermal phase-field model\n(PFM) coupling martensitic transformation with mechanics and heat transfer is\ndeveloped and applied for simulating eCE. The model is derived from a\nthermodynamic framework which invokes the microforce theory and Coleman--Noll\nprocedure. To avoid the numerical issue related to the non-differentiable\nenergy barrier function across the transition point, the austenite-martensite\ntransition energy barrier in PFM is constructed as a smooth function of\ntemperature. Both the indirect method using isothermal PFM with Maxwell\nrelations and the direct method using non-isothermal PFM are applied to\ncalculate the elastocaloric properties. The former is capable of calculating\nboth isothermal entropy change and adiabatic temperature change ($\\Delta\nT_{\\text{ad}}$), but induces high computation cost. The latter is\ncomputationally efficient, but only yields $\\Delta T_{\\text{ad}}$. In a model\nMn-22Cu alloy, the maximum $\\Delta T_{\\text{ad}}$ ($\\Delta\nT_{\\text{ad}}^{\\text{max}}$) under a compressive stress of 100 MPa is\ncalculated as 9.5 and 8.5 K in single crystal (3.5 and 3.8 K in polycrystal)\nfrom the indirect and direct method, respectively. It is found that the\ndiscrepancy of $\\Delta T_{\\text{ad}}^{\\text{max}}$ by indirect and direct\nmethod is within 10% at stress less than 150 MPa, confirming the feasibility of\nboth methods in evaluating eCE at low stress. The results demonstrate the\ndeveloped PFM herein, combined with both indirect and direct method for eCE\ncalculations, as a practicable toolkit for the computational design of\nelastocaloric devices.",

Different groups of variables (e.g. genes or proteins) will be\nimplicated in different biomolecular processes, and hence undertaking analyses\nthat are limited to identifying just a single clustering partition of the whole\ndataset is therefore liable to conflate the multiple clustering structures that\nmay arise from these distinct processes. To address this, we propose a\nmulti-view Bayesian mixture model that identifies groups of variables\n(``views\"), each of which defines a distinct clustering structure. We consider\napplications in stratified medicine, for which our principal goal is to\nidentify clusters of patients that define distinct, clinically actionable\ndisease subtypes. We adopt the semi-supervised, outcome-guided mixture\nmodelling approach of Bayesian profile regression that makes use of a response\nvariable in order to guide inference toward the clusterings that are most\nrelevant in a stratified medicine context.

      "abstract": "Multimodal image matching is an important prerequisite for multisource image\ninformation fusion. Compared with the traditional matching problem, multimodal\nfeature matching is more challenging due to the severe nonlinear radiation\ndistortion (NRD). Radiation-variation insensitive feature transform\n(RIFT)~\\cite{li2019rift} has shown very good robustness to NRD and become a\nbaseline method in multimodal feature matching. However, the high computational\ncost for rotation invariance largely limits its usage in practice. In this\npaper, we propose an improved RIFT method, called RIFT2. We develop a new\nrotation invariance technique based on dominant index value, which avoids the\nconstruction process of convolution sequence ring. Hence, it can speed up the\nrunning time and reduce the memory consumption of the original RIFT by almost 3\ntimes in theory. Extensive experiments show that RIFT2 achieves similar\nmatching performance to RIFT while being much faster and having less memory\nconsumption.

      "abstract": "Enhancing the expressive capacity of deep learning-based time series models\nwith self-supervised pre-training has become ever-increasingly prevalent in\ntime series classification. Even though numerous efforts have been devoted to\ndeveloping self-supervised models for time series data, we argue that the\ncurrent methods are not sufficient to learn optimal time series representations\ndue to solely unidirectional encoding over sparse point-wise input units. In\nthis work, we propose TimeMAE, a novel self-supervised paradigm for learning\ntransferrable time series representations based on transformer networks. The\ndistinct characteristics of the TimeMAE lie in processing each time series into\na sequence of non-overlapping sub-series via window-slicing partitioning,\nfollowed by random masking strategies over the semantic units of localized\nsub-series. Such a simple yet effective setting can help us achieve the goal of\nkilling three birds with one stone, i.e., (1) learning enriched contextual\nrepresentations of time series with a bidirectional encoding scheme; (2)\nincreasing the information density of basic semantic units; (3) efficiently\nencoding representations of time series using transformer networks.\nNevertheless, it is a non-trivial to perform reconstructing task over such a\nnovel formulated modeling paradigm. To solve the discrepancy issue incurred by\nnewly injected masked embeddings, we design a decoupled autoencoder\narchitecture, which learns the representations of visible (unmasked) positions\nand masked ones with two different encoder modules, respectively. Furthermore,\nwe construct two types of informative targets to accomplish the corresponding\npretext tasks.

      "abstract": "Smart traffic engineering and intelligent transportation services are in\nincreasing demand from governmental authorities to optimize traffic performance\nand thus reduce energy costs, increase the drivers' safety and comfort, ensure\ntraffic laws enforcement, and detect traffic violations. In this paper, we\naddress this challenge, and we leverage the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nand Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to develop an AI-integrated video analytics\nframework, called TAU (Traffic Analysis from UAVs), for automated traffic\nanalytics and understanding. Unlike previous works on traffic video analytics,\nwe propose an automated object detection and tracking pipeline from video\nprocessing to advanced traffic understanding using high-resolution UAV images.\nTAU combines six main contributions. First, it proposes a pre-processing\nalgorithm to adapt the high-resolution UAV image as input to the object\ndetector without lowering the resolution. This ensures an excellent detection\naccuracy from high-quality features, particularly the small size of detected\nobjects from UAV images. Second, it introduces an algorithm for recalibrating\nthe vehicle coordinates to ensure that vehicles are uniquely identified and\ntracked across the multiple crops of the same frame. Third, it presents a speed\ncalculation algorithm based on accumulating information from successive frames.\nFourth, TAU counts the number of vehicles per traffic zone based on the Ray\nTracing algorithm. Fifth, TAU has a fully independent algorithm for crossroad\narbitration based on the data gathered from the different zones surrounding it.\nSixth, TAU introduces a set of algorithms for extracting twenty-four types of\ninsights from the raw data collected.

      "abstract": "Introduction: The Medium Energy X-ray telescope (ME) is a collimated X-ray\ntelescope onboard the Insight hard X-ray modulation telescope (Insight-HXMT)\nsatellite. It has 1728 Si-PIN pixels readout using 54 low noise\napplication-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ME covers the energy range of\n5-30 keV and has a total detection area of 952 cm2. The typical energy\nresolution of ME at the beginning of the mission is 3 keV at 17.8 keV (Full\nWidth at Half Maximum, FWHM) and the time resolution is 255 us. In this study,\nwe present the in-orbit performance of ME in its first 5 years of operation.\nMethods: The performance of ME was monitored using onboard radioactive sources\nand astronomical X-ray objects. ME carries six 241Am radioactive sources for\nonboard calibration, which can continuously illuminate the calibration pixels.\nThe long-term performance evolution of ME can be quantified using the\nproperties of the accumulated spectra of the calibration pixels. In addition,\nobservations of the Crab Nebula and the pulsar were used to check the long-term\nevolution of the detection efficiency as a function of energy. Conclusion:\nAfter 5 years of operation, 742 cm2 of the Si-PIN pixels were still working\nnormally. The peak positions of 241Am emission lines gradually shifted to the\nhigh energy region, implying a slow increase in ME gain of 1.43%. A comparison\nof the ME spectra of the Crab Nebula and the pulsar shows that the E-C\nrelations and the redistribution matrix file are still acceptable for most data\nanalysis works, and there is no detectable variation in the detection\nefficiency.",

      "abstract": "Model attribution is a critical component of deep neural networks (DNNs) for\nits interpretability to complex models. Recent studies bring up attention to\nthe security of attribution methods as they are vulnerable to attribution\nattacks that generate similar images with dramatically different attributions.\nExisting works have been investigating empirically improving the robustness of\nDNNs against those attacks; however, none of them explicitly quantifies the\nactual deviations of attributions. In this work, for the first time, a\nconstrained optimization problem is formulated to derive an upper bound that\nmeasures the largest dissimilarity of attributions after the samples are\nperturbed by any noises within a certain region while the classification\nresults remain the same. Based on the formulation, different practical\napproaches are introduced to bound the attributions above using Euclidean\ndistance and cosine similarity under both $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_\\infty$-norm\nperturbations constraints. The bounds developed by our theoretical study are\nvalidated on various datasets and two different types of attacks (PGD attack\nand IFIA attribution attack). Over 10 million attacks in the experiments\nindicate that the proposed upper bounds effectively quantify the robustness of\nmodels based on the worst-case attribution dissimilarities.",

      "abstract": "Today, we are in the era of big data, and data are becoming more and more\nimportant, especially private data. Secure Multi-party Computation (SMPC)\ntechnology enables parties to perform computing tasks without revealing\noriginal data. However, the underlying implementation of SMPC is too heavy,\nsuch as garbled circuit (GC) and oblivious transfer(OT). Every time a piece of\ndata is added, the resources consumed by GC and OT will increase a lot.\nTherefore, it is unacceptable to process large-scale data in a single SMPC\ntask.\n  In this work, we propose a novel theory called SMPC Task Decomposition\n(SMPCTD), which can securely decompose a single SMPC task into multiple SMPC\nsub-tasks and multiple local tasks without leaking the original data. After\ndecomposition, the computing time, memory and communication consumption drop\nsharply. We then decompose three machine learning (ML) SMPC tasks using our\ntheory and implement them based on a hybrid protocol framework called ABY.\nFurthermore, we use incremental computation technique to expand the amount of\ndata involved in these three SMPC tasks. The experimental results show that\nafter decomposing these three SMPC tasks, the time, memory and communication\nconsumption are not only greatly reduced, but also stabilized within a certain\nrange.",

Nonetheless, the need for\nexternal electric power to conduct electrical resistivity measurements\nrestricts the scalability of this technology, especially when implemented in\nremote structures. To address this issue, this manuscript thoroughly analyzes\nthe piezoelectric properties of cement composites doped with reduced graphene\noxide (rGO) and evaluates their potential as self-powered strain sensors. To do\nso, a comprehensive methodology involving voltammetry measurements, open\ncircuit potential determination, and uniaxial compression testing is developed\nto determine the piezoelectric coefficients of charge $d_{33}$ and voltage\n$g_{33}$. Furthermore, a novel circuital model for signal processing of the\nelectromechanical response is developed and experimentally validated in terms\nof time series of output voltage, resistance, and the generated electric power.\nThe developed methodology is applied to laboratory samples manufactured\nfollowing two different filler dispersion methods. The presented results\nevidence that samples prepared by ultrasonic cleaner dispersion achieve optimal\nproperties, with a piezoelectric charge coefficient of\n1122.28$\\mathrm{\\pm}$246.67 pC/N, about 47 times greater than previously\nreported composites in the literature.

      "title": "Unlimited-Size Diffusion Restoration",
      "abstract": "Recently, using diffusion models for zero-shot image restoration (IR) has\nbecome a new hot paradigm. This type of method only needs to use the\npre-trained off-the-shelf diffusion models, without any finetuning, and can\ndirectly handle various IR tasks. The upper limit of the restoration\nperformance depends on the pre-trained diffusion models, which are in rapid\nevolution. However, current methods only discuss how to deal with fixed-size\nimages, but dealing with images of arbitrary sizes is very important for\npractical applications. This paper focuses on how to use those diffusion-based\nzero-shot IR methods to deal with any size while maintaining the excellent\ncharacteristics of zero-shot. A simple way to solve arbitrary size is to divide\nit into fixed-size patches and solve each patch independently. But this may\nyield significant artifacts since it neither considers the global semantics of\nall patches nor the local information of adjacent patches. Inspired by the\nRange-Null space Decomposition, we propose the Mask-Shift Restoration to\naddress local incoherence and propose the Hierarchical Restoration to alleviate\nout-of-domain issues. Our simple, parameter-free approaches can be used not\nonly for image restoration but also for image generation of unlimited sizes,\nwith the potential to be a general tool for diffusion models.

Some of these money are taken as profit\nand some are reused at a later time according to certain criteria. After\ndescribing the algorithm, we test it using the 1-minute-tick data for Cardano's\nprice on Binance. We see that the agent performs better than trading with\nrandomly chosen actions on each timestep.

The underlying domain is the\nso-called agro-detection class of problems, and the specific objective is to\nlearn a complementary ensemble of sporadic input maps. While super-resolution\nalgorithms are branded with the capacity to enhance various attractive features\nin generic photography, we argue that they must meet certain requirements, and\nmore importantly, that their outcome does not necessarily guarantee an\nimprovement in engineering detection problem-solving (unlike so-called\naesthetics/artistic super-resolution in ImageNet-like datasets). By presenting\nspecific data-driven case studies, we outline a set of limitations and\nrecommendations for deploying super-resolution algorithms for agro-detection\nproblems. Another conclusion states that super-resolution algorithms can be\nused for learning missing spectral channels, and that their usage may result in\nsome desired side-effects such as channels' synchronization.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Treatment planning systems (TPS) are an essential component for\nsimulating and optimizing a radiation therapy treatment before administering it\nto the patient. It ensures that the tumor is well covered and the dose to the\nhealthy tissues is minimized. However, the TPS provided by commercial companies\noften come with a large panel of tools, each implemented in the form of a\nblack-box making it difficult for researchers to use them for implementing and\ntesting new ideas. To address this issue, we have developed an open-source TPS.\nApproach. We have developed an open-source software platform, OpenTPS\n(opentps.org), to generate treatment plans for external beam radiation therapy,\nand in particular for proton therapy. It is designed to be a flexible and\nuser-friendly platform (coded with the freely usable Python language) that can\nbe used by medical physicists, radiation oncologists, and other members of the\nradiation therapy community to create customized treatment plans for\neducational and research purposes. Result. OpenTPS includes a range of tools\nand features that can be used to analyze patient anatomy, simulate the delivery\nof the radiation beam, and optimize the treatment plan to achieve the desired\ndose distribution. It can be used to create treatment plans for a variety of\ncancer types and was designed to be extended to other treatment modalities.\nSignificance. A new open-source treatment planning system has been built for\nresearch in proton therapy. Its flexibility allows an easy integration of new\ntechniques and customization of treatment plans. It is freely available for use\nand is regularly updated and supported by a community of users and developers\nwho contribute to the ongoing development and improvement of the software.",

      "abstract": "Multi-modal image registration spatially aligns two images with different\ndistributions. One of its major challenges is that images acquired from\ndifferent imaging machines have different imaging distributions, making it\ndifficult to focus only on the spatial aspect of the images and ignore\ndifferences in distributions. In this study, we developed a self-supervised\napproach, Indescribable Multi-model Spatial Evaluator (IMSE), to address\nmulti-modal image registration. IMSE creates an accurate multi-modal spatial\nevaluator to measure spatial differences between two images, and then optimizes\nregistration by minimizing the error predicted of the evaluator. To optimize\nIMSE performance, we also proposed a new style enhancement method called\nShuffle Remap which randomizes the image distribution into multiple segments,\nand then randomly disorders and remaps these segments, so that the distribution\nof the original image is changed. Shuffle Remap can help IMSE to predict the\ndifference in spatial location from unseen target distributions. Our results\nshow that IMSE outperformed the existing methods for registration using T1-T2\nand CT-MRI datasets. IMSE also can be easily integrated into the traditional\nregistration process, and can provide a convenient way to evaluate and\nvisualize registration results. IMSE also has the potential to be used as a new\nparadigm for image-to-image translation. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Kid-Liet/IMSE.",

      "abstract": "Since 2014, the F\\'ed\\'eration Internationale de l'Automobile has prescribed\na parallel hybrid powertrain for the Formula 1 race cars. The complex low-level\ninteractions between the thermal and the electrical part represent a\nnon-trivial and challenging system to be controlled online. We present a novel\ncontroller architecture composed of a supervisory controller for the energy\nmanagement, a feedforward cylinder deactivation controller, and a track\nregion-dependent low-level nonlinear model predictive controller to optimize\nthe engine actuators. Except for the nonlinear model predictive controller, the\nproposed controller subsystems are computationally inexpensive and are real\ntime capable. The framework is tested and validated in a simulation environment\nfor several realistic scenarios disturbed by driver actions or grip conditions\non the track. In particular, we analyze how the control architecture deals with\nan unexpected gearshift trajectory during an acceleration phase. Further, we\ndemonstrate how an increased maximum velocity trajectory impacts the online\nlow-level controller. Our results show a suboptimality over an entire lap with\nrespect to the benchmark solution of 49 ms and 64 ms, respectively, which we\ndeem acceptable. Compared to the same control architecture with full knowledge\nof the disturbances, the suboptimality amounted to only 2 ms and 17 ms. For all\ncase studies we show that the cylinder deactivation capability decreases the\nsuboptimality by 7 to 8 ms.",

The use of\nLegendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) quadrature endows collocated DGSEM space\ndiscretizations of nonlinear hyperbolic problems with properties that greatly\nsimplify the design of invariant domain preserving high-resolution schemes.\nCompared to many other continuous and discontinuous Galerkin method variants, a\nparticular advantage of the LGL spectral operator is the availability of a\nnatural decomposition into a compatible subcell flux discretization.\nRepresenting a high-order spatial semi-discretization in terms of intermediate\nstates, we perform flux limiting in a manner that keeps these states and the\nresults of Runge-Kutta stages in convex invariant domains. Additionally, local\nbounds may be imposed on scalar quantities of interest.

      "abstract": "Due to their high resolution, dynamic medical 2D+t and 3D+t volumes from\ncomputed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance tomography (MR) reach a size\nwhich makes them very unhandy for teleradiologic applications. A lossless\nscalable representation offers the advantage of a down-scaled version which can\nbe used for orientation or previewing, while the remaining information for\nreconstructing the full resolution is transmitted on demand. The wavelet\ntransform offers the desired scalability. A very high quality of the lowpass\nsub-band is crucial in order to use it as a down-scaled representation. We\npropose an approach based on compensated wavelet lifting for obtaining a\nscalable representation of dynamic CT and MR volumes with very high quality.\nThe mesh compensation is feasible to model the displacement in dynamic volumes\nwhich is mainly given by expansion and contraction of tissue over time. To\nachieve this, we propose an optimized estimation of the mesh compensation\nparameters to optimally fit for dynamic volumes. Within the lifting structure,\nthe inversion of the motion compensation is crucial in the update step. We\npropose to take this inversion directly into account during the estimation step\nand can improve the quality of the lowpass sub-band by 0.63 and 0.43 dB on\naverage for our tested dynamic CT and MR volumes at the cost of an increase of\nthe rate by 2.4% and 1.2% on average.",

DW-MRIs are usually acquired\nusing echo-planar imaging (EPI) with high gradient fields, which could\nintroduce severe geometric distortions that interfere with further analyses.\nMost tools for correcting distortion require two minimally weighted DW-MRI\nimages (B0) acquired with different phase-encoding directions, and they can\ntake hours to process per subject. Since a great amount of diffusion data are\nonly acquired with a single phase-encoding direction, the application of\nexisting approaches is limited.

MaskDeep treats each patch in the\nrepresentation space as an independent instance. We mask part of patches in the\nrepresentation space and then utilize sparse visible patches to reconstruct\nhigh semantic image representation. The intuition of MaskDeep lies in the fact\nthat models can reason from sparse visible patches semantic to the global\nsemantic of the image. We further propose three designs in our framework: 1) a\nHierarchical Deep-Masking module to concern the hierarchical property of patch\nrepresentations, 2) a multi-group strategy to improve the efficiency without\nany extra computing consumption of the encoder and 3) a multi-target strategy\nto provide more description of the global semantic.

On COCO object detection tasks, MaskDeep outperforms the\nself-supervised method SoCo, which specifically designed for object detection.\nWhen trained with 100 epochs, MaskDeep achieves 69.6% Top1 accuracy, which\nsurpasses current methods trained with 200 epochs, such as HCSC, by 0.4% .",

      "abstract": "Deep learning generally suffers from enormous computational resources and\ntime-consuming training processes. Broad Learning System (BLS) and its\nconvolutional variants have been proposed to mitigate these issues and have\nachieved superb performance in image classification. However, the existing\nconvolutional-based broad learning system (C-BLS) either lacks an efficient\ntraining method and incremental learning capability or suffers from poor\nperformance. To this end, we propose a convolutional broad learning system\n(ConvBLS) based on the spherical K-means (SKM) algorithm and two-stage\nmulti-scale (TSMS) feature fusion, which consists of the convolutional feature\n(CF) layer, convolutional enhancement (CE) layer, TSMS feature fusion layer,\nand output layer. First, unlike the current C-BLS, the simple yet efficient SKM\nalgorithm is utilized to learn the weights of CF layers. Compared with random\nfilters, the SKM algorithm makes the CF layer learn more comprehensive spatial\nfeatures. Second, similar to the vanilla BLS, CE layers are established to\nexpand the feature space. Third, the TSMS feature fusion layer is proposed to\nextract more effective multi-scale features through the integration of CF\nlayers and CE layers. Thanks to the above design and the pseudo-inverse\ncalculation of the output layer weights, our proposed ConvBLS method is\nunprecedentedly efficient and effective. Finally, the corresponding incremental\nlearning algorithms are presented for rapid remodeling if the model deems to\nexpand. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

We observe several\nunique challenges: wires are thin, lengthy, and sparse. These are rare\nproperties of subjects that common segmentation tasks cannot handle, especially\nin high-resolution images. We thus propose a two-stage method that leverages\nboth global and local contexts to accurately segment wires in high-resolution\nimages efficiently, and a tile-based inpainting strategy to remove the wires\ngiven our predicted segmentation masks. We also introduce the first wire\nsegmentation benchmark dataset, WireSegHR.

      "title": "Tracker: Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Tracking Control of\n  Human Finger Attached with Thin McKibben Muscles",
      "abstract": "To adopt the soft hand exoskeleton to support activities of daily livings, it\nis necessary to control finger joints precisely with the exoskeleton. The\nproblem of controlling joints to follow a given trajectory is called the\ntracking control problem. In this study, we focus on the tracking control\nproblem of a human finger attached with thin McKibben muscles. To achieve\nprecise control with thin McKibben muscles, there are two problems: one is the\ncomplex characteristics of the muscles, for example, non-linearity, hysteresis,\nuncertainties in the real world, and the other is the difficulty in accessing a\nprecise model of the muscles and human fingers. To solve these problems, we\nadopted DreamerV2, which is a model-based reinforcement learning method, but\nthe target trajectory cannot be generated by the learned model. Therefore, we\npropose Tracker, which is an extension of DreamerV2 for the tracking control\nproblem. In the experiment, we showed that Tracker can achieve an approximately\n81% smaller error than PID for the control of a two-link manipulator that\nimitates a part of human index finger from the metacarpal bone to the proximal\nbone. Tracker achieved the control of the third joint of the human index finger\nwith a small error by being trained for approximately 60 minutes. In addition,\nit took approximately 15 minutes, which is less than the time required for the\nfirst training, to achieve almost the same accuracy by fine-tuning the policy\npre-trained by the user's finger after taking off and attaching thin McKibben\nmuscles again as the accuracy before taking off.",

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning in a non-stationary reinforcement\nlearning (RL) environment, where the setting can be fully described by a\npiecewise stationary discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP). We introduce\na variant of the Restarted Bayesian Online Change-Point Detection algorithm\n(R-BOCPD) that operates on input streams originating from the more general\nmultinomial distribution and provides near-optimal theoretical guarantees in\nterms of false-alarm rate and detection delay. Based on this, we propose an\nimproved version of the UCRL2 algorithm for MDPs with state transition kernel\nsampled from a multinomial distribution, which we call R-BOCPD-UCRL2. We\nperform a finite-time performance analysis and show that R-BOCPD-UCRL2 enjoys a\nfavorable regret bound of $O\\left(D O \\sqrt{A T K_T \\log\\left (\\frac{T}{\\delta}\n\\right) + \\frac{K_T \\log \\frac{K_T}{\\delta}}{\\min\\limits_\\ell \\:\n\\mathbf{KL}\\left(\n{\\mathbf{\\theta}^{(\\ell+1)}}\\mid\\mid{\\mathbf{\\theta}^{(\\ell)}}\\right)}}\\right)$,\nwhere $D$ is the largest MDP diameter from the set of MDPs defining the\npiecewise stationary MDP setting, $O$ is the finite number of states (constant\nover all changes), $A$ is the finite number of actions (constant over all\nchanges), $K_T$ is the number of change points up to horizon $T$, and\n$\\mathbf{\\theta}^{(\\ell)}$ is the transition kernel during the interval\n$[c_\\ell, c_{\\ell+1})$, which we assume to be multinomially distributed over\nthe set of states $\\mathbb{O}$. Interestingly, the performance bound does not\ndirectly scale with the variation in MDP state transition distributions and\nrewards, ie. can also model abrupt changes. In practice, R-BOCPD-UCRL2\noutperforms the state-of-the-art in a variety of scenarios in synthetic\nenvironments. We provide a detailed experimental setup along with a code\nrepository (upon publication) that can be used to easily reproduce our\nexperiments.",

      "abstract": "Searching on bipartite graphs is basal and versatile to many real-world Web\napplications, e.g., online recommendation, database retrieval, and\nquery-document searching. Given a query node, the conventional approaches rely\non the similarity matching with the vectorized node embeddings in the\ncontinuous Euclidean space. To efficiently manage intensive similarity\ncomputation, developing hashing techniques for graph structured data has\nrecently become an emerging research direction. Despite the retrieval\nefficiency in Hamming space, prior work is however confronted with catastrophic\nperformance decay. In this work, we investigate the problem of hashing with\nGraph Convolutional Network on bipartite graphs for effective Top-N search. We\npropose an end-to-end Bipartite Graph Convolutional Hashing approach, namely\nBGCH, which consists of three novel and effective modules: (1) adaptive graph\nconvolutional hashing, (2) latent feature dispersion, and (3) Fourier\nserialized gradient estimation. Specifically, the former two modules achieve\nthe substantial retention of the structural information against the inevitable\ninformation loss in hash encoding; the last module develops Fourier Series\ndecomposition to the hashing function in the frequency domain mainly for more\naccurate gradient estimation. The extensive experiments on six real-world\ndatasets not only show the performance superiority over the competing\nhashing-based counterparts, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of all\nproposed model components contained therein.",

In contrast, relatively limited\nresearch has investigated effective defenses against backdoor attacks in RL.\nThis paper proposes the Recovery Triggered States (RTS) method, a novel\napproach that effectively protects the victim agents from backdoor attacks. RTS\ninvolves building a surrogate network to approximate the dynamics model.\nDevelopers can then recover the environment from the triggered state to a clean\nstate, thereby preventing attackers from activating backdoors hidden in the\nagent by presenting the trigger. When training the surrogate to predict states,\nwe incorporate agent action information to reduce the discrepancy between the\nactions taken by the agent on predicted states and the actions taken on real\nstates.

      "abstract": "The recent detection transformer (DETR) has advanced object detection, but\nits application on resource-constrained devices requires massive computation\nand memory resources. Quantization stands out as a solution by representing the\nnetwork in low-bit parameters and operations. However, there is a significant\nperformance drop when performing low-bit quantized DETR (Q-DETR) with existing\nquantization methods. We find that the bottlenecks of Q-DETR come from the\nquery information distortion through our empirical analyses. This paper\naddresses this problem based on a distribution rectification distillation\n(DRD). We formulate our DRD as a bi-level optimization problem, which can be\nderived by generalizing the information bottleneck (IB) principle to the\nlearning of Q-DETR. At the inner level, we conduct a distribution alignment for\nthe queries to maximize the self-information entropy. At the upper level, we\nintroduce a new foreground-aware query matching scheme to effectively transfer\nthe teacher information to distillation-desired features to minimize the\nconditional information entropy. Extensive experimental results show that our\nmethod performs much better than prior arts. For example, the 4-bit Q-DETR can\ntheoretically accelerate DETR with ResNet-50 backbone by 6.6x and achieve 39.4%\nAP, with only 2.6% performance gaps than its real-valued counterpart on the\nCOCO dataset.",

In\nthis work, we present a decoupled one-stage network dubbed DOAD, to mitigate\nabove issues and improve the efficiency for spatio-temporal action detection.\nTo achieve it, we decouple detection and action recognition into two branches.\nSpecifically, one branch focuses on detection representation for actor\ndetection, and the other one for action recognition. For the action branch, we\ndesign a transformer-based module (TransPC) to model pairwise relationships\nbetween people and context. Different from commonly used vector-based dot\nproduct in self-attention, it is built upon a novel matrix-based key and value\nfor Hadamard attention to model person-context information. It not only\nexploits relationships between person pairs but also takes into account context\nand relative position information. The results on AVA and UCF101-24 datasets\nshow that our method is competitive with two-stage state-of-the-art methods\nwith significant efficiency improvement.",

This compression is usually obtained by exploiting some physical\nstructure of the wavefunction, which leads to issues when the system changes\nand that structure is lost. Compressions which are efficient near equilibrium\n(coupled cluster) or in 1-D systems (DMRG) often fail catastrophically\nelsewhere. To overcome these issues, we seek a scheme that compresses\nwavefunctions without any supervised physical information. In this manuscript,\nwe introduce a scheme to compress molecular wavefunctions using a model for\nhigh dimensional functions from machine learning: a restricted Boltzmann\nmachine (RBM).

      "abstract": "Currently, salience-based channel pruning makes continuous breakthroughs in\nnetwork compression. In the realization, the salience mechanism is used as a\nmetric of channel salience to guide pruning. Therefore, salience-based channel\npruning can dynamically adjust the channel width at run-time, which provides a\nflexible pruning scheme. However, there are two problems emerging: a gating\nfunction is often needed to truncate the specific salience entries to zero,\nwhich destabilizes the forward propagation; dynamic architecture brings more\ncost for indexing in inference which bottlenecks the inference speed. In this\npaper, we propose a Progressive Channel-Shrinking (PCS) method to compress the\nselected salience entries at run-time instead of roughly approximating them to\nzero. We also propose a Running Shrinking Policy to provide a testing-static\npruning scheme that can reduce the memory access cost for filter indexing. We\nevaluate our method on ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets over two prevalent\nnetworks: ResNet and VGG, and demonstrate that our PCS outperforms all\nbaselines and achieves state-of-the-art in terms of compression-performance\ntradeoff. Moreover, we observe a significant and practical acceleration of\ninference.",

Conversely, Transformers were\noriginally introduced over natural language sequences, where each token\nrepresents a subword - a chunk of raw data of arbitrary size. In this work, we\napply this approach to Vision Transformers by introducing a novel image\ntokenization scheme, replacing the standard uniform grid with a\nmixed-resolution sequence of tokens, where each token represents a patch of\narbitrary size. Using the Quadtree algorithm and a novel saliency scorer, we\nconstruct a patch mosaic where low-saliency areas of the image are processed in\nlow resolution, routing more of the model's capacity to important image\nregions.

      "abstract": "Representation learning is an important step in the machine learning\npipeline. Given the current biological sequencing data volume, learning an\nexplicit representation is prohibitive due to the dimensionality of the\nresulting feature vectors. Kernel-based methods, e.g., SVM, are a proven\nefficient and useful alternative for several machine learning (ML) tasks such\nas sequence classification. Three challenges with kernel methods are (i) the\ncomputation time, (ii) the memory usage (storing an $n\\times n$ matrix), and\n(iii) the usage of kernel matrices limited to kernel-based ML methods\n(difficult to generalize on non-kernel classifiers). While (i) can be solved\nusing approximate methods, challenge (ii) remains for typical kernel methods.\nSimilarly, although non-kernel-based ML methods can be applied to kernel\nmatrices by extracting principal components (kernel PCA), it may result in\ninformation loss, while being computationally expensive. In this paper, we\npropose a general-purpose representation learning approach that embodies kernel\nmethods' qualities while avoiding computation, memory, and generalizability\nchallenges. This involves computing a low-dimensional embedding of each\nsequence, using random projections of its $k$-mer frequency vectors,\nsignificantly reducing the computation needed to compute the dot product and\nthe memory needed to store the resulting representation. Our proposed fast and\nalignment-free embedding method can be used as input to any distance (e.g., $k$\nnearest neighbors) and non-distance (e.g., decision tree) based ML method for\nclassification and clustering tasks. Using different forms of biological\nsequences as input, we perform a variety of real-world classification tasks,\nsuch as SARS-CoV-2 lineage and gene family classification, outperforming\nseveral state-of-the-art embedding and kernel methods in predictive\nperformance.",

By analyzing the unbroken and continuous light curve\nobtained by TESS, we found that it is a marginal contact binary with a very low\nfill-out factor of about 2\\%. The O-C diagram of V606 Cen is constructed for\nthe first time based on the 118.8-years eclipse times. It is found that the O-C\ndiagram shows a downward parabolic change together with a cyclic oscillation\nwith an amplitude of 0.0544\\, d and a period of 88.8\\, yr. The downward\nparabolic variation reveals a linear period decrease at a rate of $dP/dt =\n-2.06 \\times{10^{-7}} d \\cdot yr^{-1}$ that can be explained by the mass\ntransfer from the more massive component to the less massive one. Both the\nmarginal contact configuration and the continuous period decrease suggest that\nV606 Cen is a newly formed contact binary via Case A mass transfer. Meanwhile,\nthe cyclic change in the O-C diagram can be explained by the Light-Travel Time\nEffect via the presence of a third body. The lowest mass of the tertiary\ncompanion is determined as M$_{3}$ = 4.51($\\pm0.38$)M$_{\\odot}$ that is\norbiting around the central eclipsing binary in a nearly circular orbit\n(e=0.32). All the results indicate that V606 Cen is a newly formed massive\ncontact binary and just reaches the contact configuration during the mass\ntransfer in a hierarchical triple system.",

      "abstract": "This article is about an image transform called 3D-DCT, or three-dimensional\ndiscrete cosine transform. This is an extension of the well-known 1D and\n2D-DCT, which is extensively used, mostly in multimedia coding. A modification\nof 1D-DCT (MDCT) is used in audio coding, whereas 2D-DCT is the key concept for\nJPEG standard (still image coding) and also for very popular video coding\nstandards: MPEG-1 and 2, H.261 & H.263. Other, more modern methods like\nMPEG-4/H.264 and the newest MPEG-H/H.265 use a modified version of 2D-DCT.\nNevertheless, 3D-DCT is less known. In this work, a simple implementation for\n3D-DCT is constructed and some applications are explored. This is designed as a\nmaterial for class work but, as it will be shown in this paper, some practical\napplications can be interesting. 3D-DCT can be applied for creating a video\ncoder much simpler than those following MPEG-x/H.26x and with only slightly\nless performance. 3D-DCT has also been tested for 3D medical imaging (CT\nstudies) coding, yielding very interesting results.",

      "abstract": "Cell spreading and motility on an adhesive substrate are driven by the active\nphysical forces generated by the actin cytoskeleton. We have recently shown\nthat coupling curved membrane complexes to protrusive forces, exerted by the\nactin polymerization that they recruit, provides a mechanism that can give rise\nto spontaneous membrane shapes and patterns. In the presence of an adhesive\nsubstrate, this model was shown to give rise to an emergent motile phenotype,\nresembling a motile cell. Here, we utilize this ``minimal-cell\" model to\nexplore the impact of external shear flow on the cell shape and migration on a\nuniform adhesive flat substrate. We find that in the presence of shear the\nmotile cell reorients such that its leading edge, where the curved active\nproteins aggregate, faces the shear flow. The flow-facing configuration is\nfound to minimize the adhesion energy by allowing the cell to spread more\nefficiently over the substrate. For the non-motile vesicle shapes, we find that\nthey mostly slide and roll with the shear flow. We compare these theoretical\nresults with experimental observations, and suggest that the tendency of many\ncell types to move against the flow may arise from the very general, and\nnon-cell-type-specific mechanism predicted by our model.",

At every point in space these fields couple the internal atomic\nstates in a three-level Lambda coupling configuration. Adiabatically following\nthe local wavefunction of the resulting dark state yields a spatially uniform\nBorn-Oppenheimer potential augmented by geometric scalar and vector potentials\nappearing due to spatially rapid changes of the wavefunction. Depending on\nsystem parameters, we find that the geometric scalar potential can interpolate\nfrom a 2D analogue of the Kronig-Penney lattice, to an array of tubes with a\nzig-zag shaped barrier. The geometric vector potential induces a spatially\nperiodic effective magnetic field (the Berry's curvature) that can be tuned to\ncause destructive interference between neighboring tubes, thereby decoupling\nthem at a critical point in parameter space. We numerically investigate the\nenergy spectrum including decay from the excited state, and find that the\nadiabatic approximation is sound for strong coupling strengths, leading to\nnegligible loss in the dark state manifold. Furthermore, the spectrum is\nwell-described by a non-Hermitian tight binding model with on-site losses, and\nhopping characterized by both loss and, surprisingly, gain.",

Specifically, we analyze the\nlearning dynamics of SGD over the quadratic loss with unbiased label noises,\nwhere we model the dynamics of SGD as a stochastic differentiable equation\n(SDE) with two diffusion terms (namely a Doubly Stochastic Model). While the\nfirst diffusion term is caused by mini-batch sampling over the\n(label-noiseless) loss gradients as many other works on SGD, our model\ninvestigates the second noise term of SGD dynamics, which is caused by\nmini-batch sampling over the label noises, as an implicit regularizer. Our\ntheoretical analysis finds such implicit regularizer would favor some\nconvergence points that could stabilize model outputs against perturbation of\nparameters (namely inference stability). Though similar phenomenon have been\ninvestigated, our work doesn't assume SGD as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck like process\nand achieve a more generalizable result with convergence of approximation\nproved. To validate our analysis, we design two sets of empirical studies to\nanalyze the implicit regularizer of SGD with unbiased random label noises for\ndeep neural networks training and linear regression.",

      "abstract": "In England, it is anecdotally remarked that the number of Greggs bakeries to\nbe found in a town is a reliable measure of the area's 'Northern-ness'.\nConversely, a commercial competitor to Greggs in the baked goods and sandwiches\nmarket, Pret-a-Manger, is reputed to be popular in more 'southern' areas of\nEngland. Using a Support Vector Machine and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)\nRegression Model, the relative geographical distributions of Greggs and Pret\nhave been utilised for the first time to quantify the North-South divide in\nEngland. The calculated dividing lines were each compared to another line,\nbased on Gross Domestic Household Income (GDHI). The lines match remarkably\nwell, and we conclude that this is likely because much of England's wealth is\nconcentrated in London, as are most of England's Pret-a-Manger shops. Further\nstudies were conducted based on the relative geographical distributions of\npopular supermarkets Morrisons and Waitrose, which are also considered to have\na North-South association. This analysis yields different results. For all\nmetrics, the North-South dividing line passes close to the M1 Watford Gap\nservices. As a common British idiom, this location is oft quoted as one point\nalong the English North-South divide, and it is notable that this work agrees.\nThis tongue-in-cheek analysis aims to highlight more serious factors\nhighlighting the North-South divide, such as life expectancy, education, and\npoverty.",

      "abstract": "Bullet time is a type of visual effect commonly used in film, television and\ngames that makes time seem to slow down or stop while still preserving dynamic\ndetails in the scene. It usually requires multiple sets of cameras to move\nslowly with the subject and is synthesized using post-production techniques,\nwhich is costly and one-time. The dynamic scene perspective reconstruction\ntechnology based on neural rendering field can be used to solve this\nrequirement, but most of the current methods are poor in reconstruction\naccuracy due to the blurred input image and overfitting of dynamic and static\nregions. Based on the NSFF algorithm, this paper reconstructed the common time\nspecial effects scenes in movies and television from a new perspective. To\nimprove the accuracy of the reconstructed images, fuzzy kernel was added to the\nnetwork for reconstruction and analysis of the fuzzy process, and the clear\nperspective after analysis was input into the NSFF to improve the accuracy. By\nusing the optical flow prediction information to suppress the dynamic network\ntimely, the network is forced to improve the reconstruction effect of dynamic\nand static networks independently, and the ability to understand and\nreconstruct dynamic and static scenes is improved. To solve the overfitting\nproblem of dynamic and static scenes, a new dynamic and static cross entropy\nloss is designed. Experimental results show that compared with original NSFF\nand other new perspective reconstruction algorithms of dynamic scenes, the\nimproved NSFF-RFCT improves the reconstruction accuracy and enhances the\nunderstanding ability of dynamic and static scenes.",

      "title": "Improving the Performance of OFDMA-based Wi-Fi Network with Hybrid\n  Medium Access Control Protocol Design",
      "abstract": "Nowadays, IEEE 802.11, i.e., Wi-Fi has emerged as a prevailing technology for\nbroadband wireless networking. To meet the tremendous rise of demand for future\ngeneration wireless LANs, a robust and efficient MAC protocol is required for\nthe Wi-Fi network. However, traditional MAC mechanisms are not suitable for\nnext-generation communications due to some inherent constraints. In this\nregard, OFDMA technology could be adopted to design an efficient MAC protocol\nfor the Wi-Fi network.\n  The purpose of this research is to provide a high-speed network for Wi-Fi\nusers. The thesis presents three MAC protocols, namely, HTFA (High Throughput\nand Fair Access), ERA (Efficient Resource Allocation), and PRS (Proportional\nResource Scheduling), by employing the OFDMA technology. The novel protocols\nimprove Wi-Fi communication using the latest IEEE 802.11ax standard, i.e.,\nWi-Fi 6. In particular, the protocols improve several performance parameters of\nthe MAC protocol, such as increasing the throughput, goodput, fairness index,\nand reducing the packet retransmissions, collisions, etc. Simulation results\nvalidate that the new protocols are far better than the existing protocols.\n  The protocols designed in this thesis are compliant with the latest IEEE\n802.11ax standard that promises to enhance the throughput at least four times\nper user and support ten times users. Thus, the new protocols can ensure\nuninterrupted and smooth communication in highly dense environments. The thesis\ncontains a lot of resources such as the state of the art of MAC protocols,\nanalysis of contemporary protocols and their performance matrix; architecture\nof Wi-Fi system, OFDMA constraints and regulations; framework of protocols;\nanalytical models; relevant data, theory, and methods; etc. that would be the\nvaluable resources to the future researchers for the research on the Wi-Fi\nnetwork.",

      "abstract": "We propose a method that trains a neural radiance field (NeRF) to encode not\nonly the appearance of the scene but also semantic correlations between scene\npoints, regions, or entities -- aiming to capture their mutual co-variation\npatterns. In contrast to the traditional first-order photometric reconstruction\nobjective, our method explicitly regularizes the learning dynamics to align the\nJacobians of highly-correlated entities, which proves to maximize the mutual\ninformation between them under random scene perturbations. By paying attention\nto this second-order information, we can shape a NeRF to express semantically\nmeaningful synergies when the network weights are changed by a delta along the\ngradient of a single entity, region, or even a point. To demonstrate the merit\nof this mutual information modeling, we leverage the coordinated behavior of\nscene entities that emerges from our shaping to perform label propagation for\nsemantic and instance segmentation. Our experiments show that a JacobiNeRF is\nmore efficient in propagating annotations among 2D pixels and 3D points\ncompared to NeRFs without mutual information shaping, especially in extremely\nsparse label regimes -- thus reducing annotation burden. The same machinery can\nfurther be used for entity selection or scene modifications.",

      "abstract": "Modern robotics often involves multiple embodied agents operating within a\nshared environment. Path planning in these cases is considerably more\nchallenging than in single-agent scenarios. Although standard Sampling-based\nAlgorithms (SBAs) can be used to search for solutions in the robots' joint\nspace, this approach quickly becomes computationally intractable as the number\nof agents increases. To address this issue, we integrate the concept of\nfactorization into sampling-based algorithms, which requires only minimal\nmodifications to existing methods. During the search for a solution we can\ndecouple (i.e., factorize) different subsets of agents into independent\nlower-dimensional search spaces once we certify that their future solutions\nwill be independent of each other using a factorization heuristic.\nConsequently, we progressively construct a lean hypergraph where certain\n(hyper-)edges split the agents to independent subgraphs. In the best case, this\napproach can reduce the growth in dimensionality of the search space from\nexponential to linear in the number of agents. On average, fewer samples are\nneeded to find high-quality solutions while preserving the optimality,\ncompleteness, and anytime properties of SBAs. We present a general\nimplementation of a factorized SBA, derive an analytical gain in terms of\nsample complexity for PRM*, and showcase empirical results for RRG.",

To achieve this\ngoal, this article presents an in-depth systematic review of 103 publications\nin the field of reviewer assignment published in the past three decades and\navailable in the Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and\nSemantic Scholar databases. This review paper classified and discussed the RAP\napproaches into two broad categories and numerous subcategories based on their\nunderlying techniques. Furthermore, potential future research directions for\neach category are presented. This survey shows that the research on the RAP is\nbecoming more significant and that more effort is required to develop new\napproaches and a framework.",

Electron beam evaporation and sputtering techniques have been used\nto deposit NiFe thin films. For in-situ stacking of NiFe with functional\ncomplex oxides, the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method is highly desirable.\nHowever, the growth of high-quality NiFe (and non-oxide thin films in general)\nby PLD remains a formidable task. Here, we report high-quality NiFe thin films\nof various thicknesses on oxide/non-oxide substrates with desirable magnetic\nproperties by PLD at room temperature. The magnetic properties are found to be\nstrongly dependent on the laser fluence of the deposition process. The laser\nfluence of 4 Joule/cm$^2$ produces the highest magnetization of ~547 emu/cc.\nThe small coercivity (few Oersted) and sharp ferromagnetic switching behaviour\nindicate uniaxial anisotropy with an easy axis along the in-plane direction. In\naddition, thickness-dependent magnetodynamics characterizations are studied via\nferromagnetic resonance. Our findings indicate the ferromagnetic\ncharacteristics are sensitive to the quality of the oxide/non-oxide substrate\nsurface.

      "abstract": "We address the problem of clothed human reconstruction from a single image or\nuncalibrated multi-view images. Existing methods struggle with reconstructing\ndetailed geometry of a clothed human and often require a calibrated setting for\nmulti-view reconstruction. We propose a flexible framework which, by leveraging\nthe parametric SMPL-X model, can take an arbitrary number of input images to\nreconstruct a clothed human model under an uncalibrated setting. At the core of\nour framework is our novel self-evolved signed distance field (SeSDF) module\nwhich allows the framework to learn to deform the signed distance field (SDF)\nderived from the fitted SMPL-X model, such that detailed geometry reflecting\nthe actual clothed human can be encoded for better reconstruction. Besides, we\npropose a simple method for self-calibration of multi-view images via the\nfitted SMPL-X parameters. This lifts the requirement of tedious manual\ncalibration and largely increases the flexibility of our method. Further, we\nintroduce an effective occlusion-aware feature fusion strategy to account for\nthe most useful features to reconstruct the human model. We thoroughly evaluate\nour framework on public benchmarks, demonstrating significant superiority over\nthe state-of-the-arts both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

      "abstract": "Optically levitated nanomechanical resonators in vacuum perform ultrahigh\nsensitivity for mechanical quantities by overcoming the limitations of clamped\nresonators. However, the generally levitated silica nanoparticles (NPs) with\nlow absorption and high transparence still face difficulties surviving in high\nvacuum with unclear reason. By monitoring the physicochemical properties like\nscattering, mass and density of amorphous silica NPs during pumping process. we\npropose that the loss of NPs may arises from the motional instability induced\nby laser heating lead releasing at low pressure. In this work, two types of NPs\nare heat treated from 100 to 1200 degree Celsius to release impurities before\nbeing loaded into an optical trap. The high vacuum levitation ratio for both\nNPs increase obviously after heat treatment. In particular, for NPs heated to\n600 degree Celsius, the ratio strikingly improves from ~30% to 100% and ~0 to\n85% for two types of NPs. The loss mechanism is further confirmed by their\nrelatively stable physicochemical parameters during pumping process. This work\npaves a way for wide application of levitated nano-resonators and indicates\nthat levitated vacuum optomechanical systems could be a promising tool for\ndynamics and in-situ studying of small particles like aerosols and dusts.",

The evaluation results show that our proposed models provide\nfaster inference time with comparable accuracy as compared to the state-of-art\nCNN based models. In particular, our models were able to achieve an accuracy of\n79\\% on the FFT-75 dataset with nearly 100K parameters and 164M FLOPs, which is\n4x smaller and 6x faster than the state-of-the-art classifier in the\nliterature.",

      "abstract": "Researchers commonly believe that neural networks model a high-dimensional\nspace but cannot give a clear definition of this space. What is this space?\nWhat is its dimension? And does it has finite dimensions? In this paper, we\ndevelop a plausible theory on interpreting neural networks in terms of the role\nof activation functions in neural networks and define a high-dimensional (more\nprecisely, an infinite-dimensional) space that neural networks including\ndeep-learning networks could create. We show that the activation function acts\nas a magnifying function that maps the low-dimensional linear space into an\ninfinite-dimensional space, which can distinctly identify the polynomial\napproximation of any multivariate continuous function of the variable values\nbeing the same features of the given dataset. Given a dataset with each example\nof $d$ features $f_1$, $f_2$, $\\cdots$, $f_d$, we believe that neural networks\nmodel a special space with infinite dimensions, each of which is a monomial\n$$\\prod_{i_1, i_2, \\cdots, i_d} f_1^{i_1} f_2^{i_2} \\cdots f_d^{i_d}$$ for some\nnon-negative integers ${i_1, i_2, \\cdots, i_d} \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}_{0}^{+}=\\{0,1,2,3,\\ldots\\} $.

      "abstract": "In recent years, remarkable results have been achieved in self-supervised\naction recognition using skeleton sequences with contrastive learning. It has\nbeen observed that the semantic distinction of human action features is often\nrepresented by local body parts, such as legs or hands, which are advantageous\nfor skeleton-based action recognition. This paper proposes an attention-based\ncontrastive learning framework for skeleton representation learning, called\nSkeAttnCLR, which integrates local similarity and global features for\nskeleton-based action representations. To achieve this, a multi-head attention\nmask module is employed to learn the soft attention mask features from the\nskeletons, suppressing non-salient local features while accentuating local\nsalient features, thereby bringing similar local features closer in the feature\nspace. Additionally, ample contrastive pairs are generated by expanding\ncontrastive pairs based on salient and non-salient features with global\nfeatures, which guide the network to learn the semantic representations of the\nentire skeleton. Therefore, with the attention mask mechanism, SkeAttnCLR\nlearns local features under different data augmentation views. The experiment\nresults demonstrate that the inclusion of local feature similarity\nsignificantly enhances skeleton-based action representation. Our proposed\nSkeAttnCLR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTURGB+D, NTU120-RGB+D, and\nPKU-MMD datasets.",

However, the channel-wise MLP cannot expand the\nreceptive fields, lacking the context modeling capacity, which is critical to\nsemantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a parametric-free patch rotate\noperation to reorganize the pixels spatially. It first divides the feature map\ninto multiple groups and then rotates the patches within each group. Based on\nthe proposed patch rotate operation, we design a novel segmentation network,\nnamed PRSeg, which includes an off-the-shelf backbone and a lightweight Patch\nRotate MLP decoder containing multiple Dynamic Patch Rotate Blocks\n(DPR-Blocks). In each DPR-Block, the fully connected layer is performed\nfollowing a Patch Rotate Module (PRM) to exchange spatial information between\npixels. Specifically, in PRM, the feature map is first split into the reserved\npart and rotated part along the channel dimension according to the predicted\nprobability of the Dynamic Channel Selection Module (DCSM), and our proposed\npatch rotate operation is only performed on the rotated part. Extensive\nexperiments on ADE20K, Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff 10K datasets prove the\neffectiveness of our approach.

Depending on the growth conditions of the\nNiO(001) layers and the post-annealing temperature, the preferential\nmagnetization direction of the ultrathin Fe layer grown on a NiO(001) layer\nchanged from in-plane to a direction perpendicular to the film plane.

Moreover, perpendicular magnetization was observed only when the NiO\nlayer was grown with O$_2$ flow rates higher than 2.0 sccm corresponding to\noxygen-rich NiO. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements revealed an\nenhancement in anisotropic orbital magnetic moments similar to the origin of\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy at the Fe/MgO(001) interface. The interfacial\nmagnetic anisotropy energies were 0.93 and 1.02 mJ/m$^2$ at room temperature\nand at 100 K, respectively, indicating less temperature dependence. In\ncontrast, the coercivity $H_c$ exhibited a significant temperature dependence.\nAlthough no signature of exchange bias or unidirectional loop shift was\nobserved, $H_c$ was strongly dependent on the NiO layer thickness, indicating\nthat the exchange interaction at the interface between the ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic layers was not negligible, despite the NiO(001) being a\nspin-compensated surface.",

      "abstract": "The jamming transition is a nonequilibrium critical phenomenon, which governs\ncharacteristic mechanical properties of jammed soft materials, such as pastes,\nemulsions, and granular matters. Both experiments and theory of jammed soft\nmaterials have revealed that the complex modulus measured by conventional\nmacrorheology exhibits a characteristic frequency dependence. Microrheology is\na new type of method to obtain the complex modulus, which transforms the\nmicroscopic motion of probes to the complex modulus through the generalized\nStokes relation (GSR). Although microrheology has been applied to jammed soft\nmaterials, its theoretical understanding is limited. In particular, the\nvalidity of the GSR near the jamming transition is far from obvious since there\nis a diverging length scale $l_c$, which characterizes the heterogeneous\nresponse of jammed particles. Here, we study the microrheology of jammed\nparticles by theory and numerical simulation. First, we develop a linear\nresponse formalism to calculate the response function of the probe particle,\nwhich is transformed to the complex modulus via the GSR. Then, we apply our\nformalism to a numerical model of jammed particles and find that the storage\nand loss modulus follow characteristic scaling laws near the jamming\ntransition. Importantly, the observed scaling law coincides with that in\nmacrorheology, which indicates that the GSR holds even near the jamming\ntransition. We rationalize this equivalence by asymptotic analysis of the\nobtained formalism and numerical analysis on the displacement field of jammed\nparticles under a local perturbation.",

      "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is a fundamental task in the community of medical\nimage analysis. In this paper, a novel network architecture, referred to as\nConvolution, Transformer, and Operator (CTO), is proposed. CTO employs a\ncombination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformer (ViT),\nand an explicit boundary detection operator to achieve high recognition\naccuracy while maintaining an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency.\nThe proposed CTO follows the standard encoder-decoder segmentation paradigm,\nwhere the encoder network incorporates a popular CNN backbone for capturing\nlocal semantic information, and a lightweight ViT assistant for integrating\nlong-range dependencies. To enhance the learning capacity on boundary, a\nboundary-guided decoder network is proposed that uses a boundary mask obtained\nfrom a dedicated boundary detection operator as explicit supervision to guide\nthe decoding learning process. The performance of the proposed method is\nevaluated on six challenging medical image segmentation datasets, demonstrating\nthat CTO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with a competitive model\ncomplexity.",

      "abstract": "A central problem in the theory of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)\nis to understand what structural conditions and algorithmic principles lead to\nsample-efficient learning guarantees, and how these considerations change as we\nmove from few to many agents. We study this question in a general framework for\ninteractive decision making with multiple agents, encompassing Markov games\nwith function approximation and normal-form games with bandit feedback. We\nfocus on equilibrium computation, in which a centralized learning algorithm\naims to compute an equilibrium by controlling multiple agents that interact\nwith an unknown environment. Our main contributions are:\n  - We provide upper and lower bounds on the optimal sample complexity for\nmulti-agent decision making based on a multi-agent generalization of the\nDecision-Estimation Coefficient, a complexity measure introduced by Foster et\nal. (2021) in the single-agent counterpart to our setting. Compared to the best\nresults for the single-agent setting, our bounds have additional gaps. We show\nthat no \"reasonable\" complexity measure can close these gaps, highlighting a\nstriking separation between single and multiple agents.\n  - We show that characterizing the statistical complexity for multi-agent\ndecision making is equivalent to characterizing the statistical complexity of\nsingle-agent decision making, but with hidden (unobserved) rewards, a framework\nthat subsumes variants of the partial monitoring problem. As a consequence, we\ncharacterize the statistical complexity for hidden-reward interactive decision\nmaking to the best extent possible.\n  Building on this development, we provide several new structural results,\nincluding 1) conditions under which the statistical complexity of multi-agent\ndecision making can be reduced to that of single-agent, and 2) conditions under\nwhich the so-called curse of multiple agents can be avoided.",

      "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption (HE), which allows computations on encrypted data, is\nan enabling technology for confidential cloud computing. One notable example is\nprivacy-preserving Prediction-as-a-Service (PaaS), where machine-learning\npredictions are computed on encrypted data. However, developing HE-based\nsolutions for encrypted PaaS is a tedious task which requires a careful design\nthat predominantly depends on the deployment scenario and on leveraging the\ncharacteristics of modern HE schemes. Prior works on privacy-preserving PaaS\nfocus solely on protecting the confidentiality of the client data uploaded to a\nremote model provider, e.g., a cloud offering a prediction API, and assume (or\ntake advantage of the fact) that the model is held in plaintext. Furthermore,\ntheir aim is to either minimize the latency of the service by processing one\nsample at a time, or to maximize the number of samples processed per second,\nwhile processing a fixed (large) number of samples. In this work, we present\nslytHErin, an agile framework that enables privacy-preserving PaaS beyond the\napplication scenarios considered in prior works. Thanks to its hybrid design\nleveraging HE and its multiparty variant (MHE), slytHErin enables novel PaaS\nscenarios by encrypting the data, the model or both. Moreover, slytHErin\nfeatures a flexible input data packing approach that allows processing a batch\nof an arbitrary number of samples, and several computation optimizations that\nare model-and-setting-agnostic. slytHErin is implemented in Go and it allows\nend-users to perform encrypted PaaS on custom deep learning models comprising\nfully-connected, convolutional, and pooling layers, in a few lines of code and\nwithout having to worry about the cumbersome implementation and optimization\nconcerns inherent to HE.",

      "abstract": "Digital pathology based on whole slide images (WSIs) plays a key role in\ncancer diagnosis and clinical practice. Due to the high resolution of the WSI\nand the unavailability of patch-level annotations, WSI classification is\nusually formulated as a weakly supervised problem, which relies on multiple\ninstance learning (MIL) based on patches of a WSI. In this paper, we aim to\nlearn an optimal patch-level feature space by integrating prototype learning\nwith MIL. To this end, we develop a Trainable Prototype enhanced deep MIL\n(TPMIL) framework for weakly supervised WSI classification. In contrast to the\nconventional methods which rely on a certain number of selected patches for\nfeature space refinement, we softly cluster all the instances by allocating\nthem to their corresponding prototypes. Additionally, our method is able to\nreveal the correlations between different tumor subtypes through distances\nbetween corresponding trained prototypes. More importantly, TPMIL also enables\nto provide a more accurate interpretability based on the distance of the\ninstances from the trained prototypes which serves as an alternative to the\nconventional attention score-based interpretability. We test our method on two\nWSI datasets and it achieves a new SOTA. GitHub repository:\nhttps://github.com/LitaoYang-Jet/TPMIL",

Zero phase angle (ZPA) is also a desirable\nfeature, to ensure a lower power rating requirement for the switching\nconverter. CC and CV output along with ZPA can be achieved by using a suitable\ncompensation topology. Equation manipulation techniques can be used for\ndesigning the compensation topology. But, it can be mathematically intensive\nespecially for higher order topologies. To overcome this problem, resonant-tank\nbased approaches are adopted in several works to achieve CC and CV conditions.\nHowever, equation-based approaches are depended upon either wholly or partly\nfor realizing ZPA. This approach can be tedious and lacks physical insight. The\nproposed method extends resonant tank approach to achieve ZPA also, besides CC\nand CV. The need for a separate method to achieve ZPA is eliminated. Further,\nit simplifies the process in arriving at the constraints that ensure ZPA. As a\nsample validation, the proposed method is applied to a S-SP compensation\ntopology. The CC-ZPA and CV-ZPA constraints for the S-SP topology are shown to\nbe in line with the ones arrived at using an existing equation-based impedance\napproach.

      "abstract": "Over the past 50 years, conventional network routing design has undergone\nsubstantial growth, evolving from small networks with static nodes to large\nsystems connecting billions of devices. This progress has been achieved through\nthe separation of concerns principle, which entails integrating network\nfunctionalities into a graph or random network design and employing specific\nnetwork protocols to facilitate diverse communication capabilities. This paper\naims to highlight the potential of designing routing techniques for quantum\nnetworks, which exhibit unique properties due to quantum mechanics. Quantum\nrouting design requires a substantial deviation from conventional network\ndesign protocols since it must account for the unique features of quantum\nentanglement and information. However, implementing these techniques poses\nsignificant challenges, such as decoherence and noise in quantum systems,\nrestricted communication ranges, and highly specialized hardware prerequisites.\nThe paper commences by examining essential research on quantum routing design\nmethods and proceeds to cover fundamental aspects of quantum routing,\nassociated quantum operations, and the steps necessary for building efficient\nand robust quantum networks. This paper summarizes the present state of quantum\nrouting techniques, including their principles, protocols, and challenges,\nhighlighting potential applications and future directions.",

To determine the dynamic response of the photodetector,\nits small and large signal frequency response are also evaluated.

      "abstract": "The problem of organizing and finding images in a user's directory has become\nincreasingly challenging due to the rapid growth in the number of images\ncaptured on personal devices. This paper presents a solution that utilizes zero\nshot learning to create image queries with only user provided text\ndescriptions. The paper's primary contribution is the development of an\nalgorithm that utilizes pre-trained models to extract features from images. The\nalgorithm uses OWL to check for the presence of bounding boxes and sorts images\nbased on cosine similarity scores. The algorithm's output is a list of images\nsorted in descending order of similarity, helping users to locate specific\nimages more efficiently. The paper's experiments were conducted using a custom\ndataset to simulate a user's image directory and evaluated the accuracy,\ninference time, and size of the models. The results showed that the VGG model\nachieved the highest accuracy, while the Resnet50 and InceptionV3 models had\nthe lowest inference time and size. The papers proposed algorithm provides an\neffective and efficient solution for organizing and finding images in a users\nlocal directory. The algorithm's performance and flexibility make it suitable\nfor various applications, including personal image organization and search\nengines.

      "abstract": "Multi-view subspace clustering methods have employed learned\nself-representation tensors from different tensor decompositions to exploit low\nrank information. However, the data structures embedded with\nself-representation tensors may vary in different multi-view datasets.\nTherefore, a pre-defined tensor decomposition may not fully exploit low rank\ninformation for a certain dataset, resulting in sub-optimal multi-view\nclustering performance. To alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we propose\nthe adaptively topological tensor network (ATTN) by determining the edge ranks\nfrom the structural information of the self-representation tensor, and it can\ngive a better tensor representation with the data-driven strategy.\nSpecifically, in multi-view tensor clustering, we analyze the higher-order\ncorrelations among different modes of a self-representation tensor, and prune\nthe links of the weakly correlated ones from a fully connected tensor network.\nTherefore, the newly obtained tensor networks can efficiently explore the\nessential clustering information with self-representation with different tensor\nstructures for various datasets. A greedy adaptive rank-increasing strategy is\nfurther applied to improve the capture capacity of low rank structure. We apply\nATTN on multi-view subspace clustering and utilize the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers to solve it. Experimental results show that multi-view\nsubspace clustering based on ATTN outperforms the counterparts on six\nmulti-view datasets.",

      "abstract": "The human eye consists of two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones. Rods\nare responsible for monochrome vision, and cones for color vision. The number\nof rods is much higher than the cones, which means that most human vision\nprocessing is done in monochrome. An event camera reports the change in pixel\nintensity and is analogous to rods. Event and color cameras in computer vision\nare like rods and cones in human vision. Humans can notice objects moving in\nthe peripheral vision (far right and left), but we cannot classify them (think\nof someone passing by on your far left or far right, this can trigger your\nattention without knowing who they are). Thus, rods act as a region proposal\nnetwork (RPN) in human vision. Therefore, an event camera can act as a region\nproposal network in deep learning Two-stage object detectors in deep learning,\nsuch as Mask R-CNN, consist of a backbone for feature extraction and a RPN.\nCurrently, RPN uses the brute force method by trying out all the possible\nbounding boxes to detect an object. This requires much computation time to\ngenerate region proposals making two-stage detectors inconvenient for fast\napplications. This work replaces the RPN in Mask-RCNN of detectron2 with an\nevent camera for generating proposals for moving objects. Thus, saving time and\nbeing computationally less expensive. The proposed approach is faster than the\ntwo-stage detectors with comparable accuracy",

      "abstract": "We present a comparative study on how and why contrastive learning (CL) and\nmasked image modeling (MIM) differ in their representations and in their\nperformance of downstream tasks. In particular, we demonstrate that\nself-supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs) have the following properties: (1)\nCL trains self-attentions to capture longer-range global patterns than MIM,\nsuch as the shape of an object, especially in the later layers of the ViT\narchitecture. This CL property helps ViTs linearly separate images in their\nrepresentation spaces. However, it also makes the self-attentions collapse into\nhomogeneity for all query tokens and heads. Such homogeneity of self-attention\nreduces the diversity of representations, worsening scalability and dense\nprediction performance. (2) CL utilizes the low-frequency signals of the\nrepresentations, but MIM utilizes high-frequencies. Since low- and\nhigh-frequency information respectively represent shapes and textures, CL is\nmore shape-oriented and MIM more texture-oriented. (3) CL plays a crucial role\nin the later layers, while MIM mainly focuses on the early layers. Upon these\nanalyses, we find that CL and MIM can complement each other and observe that\neven the simplest harmonization can help leverage the advantages of both\nmethods.

      "abstract": "Roman domination is a well researched topic in graph theory. Recently two new\nvariants of Roman domination, namely triple Roman domination and quadruple\nRoman domination problems have been introduced, to provide better defense\nstrategies. However, triple Roman domination and quadruple Roman domination\nproblems are NP-hard. In this paper, we have provided genetic algorithm for\nsolving triple and quadruple Roman domination problems. Programming (ILP)\nformulations for triple Roman domination and quadruple Roman domination\nproblems have been proposed. The proposed models are implemented using IBM\nCPLEX 22.1 optimization solvers and obtained results for random graphs\ngenerated using NetworkX Erdos-Renyi model.",

      "abstract": "Limited training data and severe class imbalance impose significant\nchallenges to developing clinically robust deep learning models. Federated\nlearning (FL) addresses the former by enabling different medical clients to\ncollaboratively train a deep model without sharing data. However, the class\nimbalance problem persists due to inter-client class distribution variations.\nTo overcome this, we propose federated classifier anchoring (FCA) by adding a\npersonalized classifier at each client to guide and debias the federated model\nthrough consistency learning. Additionally, FCA debiases the federated\nclassifier and each client's personalized classifier based on their respective\nclass distributions, thus mitigating divergence. With FCA, the federated\nfeature extractor effectively learns discriminative features suitably globally\nfor federation as well as locally for all participants. In clinical practice,\nthe federated model is expected to be both generalized, performing well across\nclients, and specialized, benefiting each individual client from collaboration.\nAccording to this, we propose a novel evaluation metric to assess models'\ngeneralization and specialization performance globally on an aggregated public\ntest set and locally at each client. Through comprehensive comparison and\nevaluation, FCA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with large margins for\nfederated long-tailed skin lesion classification and intracranial hemorrhage\nclassification, making it a more feasible solution in clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "Human-AI decision making is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, and\nexplanations have been proposed to facilitate better Human-AI interactions.\nRecent research has investigated the positive impact of explanations on\ndecision subjects' fairness perceptions in algorithmic decision-making. Despite\nthese advances, most studies have captured the effect of explanations in\nisolation, considering explanations as ends in themselves, and reducing them to\ntechnical solutions provided through XAI methodologies. In this vision paper,\nwe argue that the effect of explanations on fairness perceptions should rather\nbe captured in relation to decision subjects' right to contest such decisions.\nSince contestable AI systems are open to human intervention throughout their\nlifecycle, contestability requires explanations that go beyond outcomes and\nalso capture the rationales that led to the development and deployment of the\nalgorithmic system in the first place. We refer to such explanations as\nprocess-centric explanations.

We assume\nneither space compactness, nor spatial coordinates dependence, nor smallness of\ninitial data. The surprising discovery of the $6p$-th dimension bound, even for\nlocal solutions, is revealed by our approach and the Brownian-time kernel --\nthe Brownian average of an angled $d$-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger propagator --\nat its heart. We use this kernel to give a systematic approach, for all\ndimensions simultaneously, including a novel formulation -- even in the\nwell-known $d=1$ case -- of the KS equation. This yields the estimates leading\nto this article's conclusions. We achieve the stated results by fusing some of\nour earlier Brownian-time stochastic processes constructions and ideas --\nencoded in the aforementioned kernel -- with analytic ones, including complex\nand harmonic analysis; by employing suitable $N$-ball approximations together\nwith fixed point theory; and by an adaptation of the stochastic analytic\nstopping-time technique to our deterministic setting. Using a separate\nstrategy, that is also built on our Brownian-time paradigm, we treat the global\nwellposedness of the multidimensional KS equation in a followup upcoming\narticle. This work also serves as a template for another forthcoming article in\nwhich we prove similar results for the time-fractional Burgers equation in\nmultidimensional space.",

Four\nclassical EFC models are employed and a universal concave growth pattern of the\nEFC along a platoon has been demonstrated. A general framework of coupling EFC\nand CF models is tested by calibrating and simulating three classical CF\nmodels. This work first demonstrates that, at vehicle-pair level, all models\nperform well on EFC prediction. The intelligent driver model outperforms the\nother CF models on calibration accuracy, but this is not true on EFC\nprediction. Second, at platoon level, the predicted EFC is nearly constant\nalong the platoon which qualitatively differs from the experimental\nobservation. The investigation highlights that accurate estimations at vehicle\nlevel may be insufficient for analysis at platoon level due to the significant\nrole of oscillation growth and evolution in EFC estimation.",

Depending on the preparation procedures, trigonal prismatic (2H)\nor octahedral (1T) coordination of the metal atoms were obtained, exhibiting\nmetallic (1T) or semiconducting (2H) character. Both MoS2 and WS2 nanosheets\nwere found exhibiting large nonlinear optical (NLO) response, strongly\ndependent on their metallic (1T) or semiconducting (2H) character. So, the\nsemiconducting character 2H-MoS2 and 2H-WS2 exhibit positive nonlinear\nabsorption and strong self-focusing, while their metallic character\ncounterparts exhibit strong negative nonlinear absorption and important\nself-defocusing. In addition, the semiconducting MoS2 and WS2 were found\nexhibiting important and very broadband optical limiting action extended from\n450 to 1750 nm. So, by selecting the crystalline phase of the nanosheets, i.e.,\ntheir semiconduction/metallic character, their NLO response can be greatly\nmodulated. The results of the present work demonstrate unambiguously that the\ncontrol of the crystalline phase of MoS2 and WS2 provides an efficient strategy\nfor 2D nanostructures with custom made NLO properties for specific\noptoelectronic and photonic applications.",

      "title": "Joint Modelling of Dust Scattering and Thermal Emission: The Spider\n  Complex",
      "abstract": "Observations across the electromagnetic spectrum of radiative processes\ninvolving interstellar dust -- emission, extinction, and scattering -- are used\nto constrain the parameters of dust models and more directly to aid in\nforeground removal of dust for extragalactic and cosmology observations. The\nmore complementary observations, the better. Here, we quantify the relationship\nbetween scattered light and thermal emission from dust in a diffuse (cirrus)\nintermediate latitude cloud, Spider, using data from the Dragonfly Telephoto\nArray and the Herschel Space Observatory. A challenge for optical observations\nof faint cirrus is accurate removal of a contaminating spatially varying sky\nbackground. We present a technique to analyse two images of the same cirrus\nfield concurrently, correlating pixel values to capture the relationship and\nsimultaneously fitting the sky background as a complex non-correlating additive\ncomponent. For the Spider, we measure a $g-r$ color of 0.644$\\pm 0.024$ and a\nvisible wavelength to 250 $\\mu$m intensity ratio of $10^{-3} \\times (0.855\n\\pm0.025)$ and $10^{-3} \\times (1.55\\pm0.08)$ for $g$ and $r$-band\nrespectively. We show how to use any dust model that matches the thermal dust\nemission to predict an upper limit to the amount of scattered light. The actual\nbrightness of the cirrus will be fainter than this limit because of anisotropic\nscattering by the dust combined with anisotropy of the incident interstellar\nradiation field (ISRF). Using models of dust and the ISRF in the literature we\nillustrate that the predicted brightness is indeed lower, though not as faint\nas the observations indicate.",

At the same time, in two-loop approximation, W(A_0)=\nW^(1)(A_0) + W^(2)(A_0), other classical field - A_0 condensate directly\nrelated to the Polyakov loop - is also spontaneously generated. To investigate\nthe creation of the condensates together, the two loop effective potential of\nboth fields should be calculated. This program was realized recently for SU(2)\nin [1]. However, the generation of magnetic field in two-loop order was not\nstudied in detail. In the present paper, we compute the value of chromomagnetic\nfield b(T) for latter case. Then, considering the spectrum of color charged\ngluons at the background of both condensates, we conclude that the A_0\nstabilizes the magnetized vacuum at high temperature.

The\nproposed method is seventh-order accurate under the assumption that the\nvariables at the \\textit{cell centres are point values}. A problem-independent\ndiscontinuity detector is used to obtain high-order accuracy. Accordingly,\nprimitive or conservative variable reconstruction is performed around regions\nof discontinuities, whereas smooth solution regions apply flux reconstruction.\nThe proposed approach can still share the derivatives between the inviscid and\nviscous fluxes, which is the main idea behind the gradient-based\nreconstruction.

      "abstract": "In recent years, raw video denoising has garnered increased attention due to\nthe consistency with the imaging process and well-studied noise modeling in the\nraw domain. However, two problems still hinder the denoising performance.\nFirstly, there is no large dataset with realistic motions for supervised raw\nvideo denoising, as capturing noisy and clean frames for real dynamic scenes is\ndifficult. To address this, we propose recapturing existing high-resolution\nvideos displayed on a 4K screen with high-low ISO settings to construct\nnoisy-clean paired frames. In this way, we construct a video denoising dataset\n(named as ReCRVD) with 120 groups of noisy-clean videos, whose ISO values\nranging from 1600 to 25600. Secondly, while non-local temporal-spatial\nattention is beneficial for denoising, it often leads to heavy computation\ncosts. We propose an efficient raw video denoising transformer network\n(RViDeformer) that explores both short and long-distance correlations.\nSpecifically, we propose multi-branch spatial and temporal attention modules,\nwhich explore the patch correlations from local window, local low-resolution\nwindow, global downsampled window, and neighbor-involved window, and then they\nare fused together. We employ reparameterization to reduce computation costs.\nOur network is trained in both supervised and unsupervised manners, achieving\nthe best performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the\nmodel trained with our proposed dataset (ReCRVD) outperforms the model trained\nwith previous benchmark dataset (CRVD) when evaluated on the real-world outdoor\nnoisy videos.

Prior studies show that groups of agents endowed with\nheterogeneous SVO learn diverse policies in settings that resemble the\nincentive structure of Prisoner's dilemma. Our work extends this body of\nresults and demonstrates that (1) heterogeneous SVO leads to meaningfully\ndiverse policies across a range of incentive structures in sequential social\ndilemmas, as measured by task-specific diversity metrics; and (2) learning a\nbest response to such policy diversity leads to better zero-shot generalization\nin some situations. We show that these best-response agents learn policies that\nare conditioned on their co-players, which we posit is the reason for improved\nzero-shot generalization results.",

      "abstract": "Federated Semi-supervised Learning (FedSSL) has emerged as a new paradigm for\nallowing distributed clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model\nover scarce labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However, existing works\nfor FedSSL rely on a closed-world assumption that all local training data and\nglobal testing data are from seen classes observed in the labeled dataset. It\nis crucial to go one step further: adapting FL models to an open-world setting,\nwhere unseen classes exist in the unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Federatedopen-world Semi-Supervised Learning (FedoSSL) framework, which\ncan solve the key challenge in distributed and open-world settings, i.e., the\nbiased training process for heterogeneously distributed unseen classes.\nSpecifically, since the advent of a certain unseen class depends on a client\nbasis, the locally unseen classes (exist in multiple clients) are likely to\nreceive differentiated superior aggregation effects than the globally unseen\nclasses (exist only in one client). We adopt an uncertainty-aware suppressed\nloss to alleviate the biased training between locally unseen and globally\nunseen classes. Besides, we enable a calibration module supplementary to the\nglobal aggregation to avoid potential conflicting knowledge transfer caused by\ninconsistent data distribution among different clients. The proposed FedoSSL\ncan be easily adapted to state-of-the-art FL methods, which is also validated\nvia extensive experiments on benchmarks and real-world datasets (CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100 and CINIC-10).",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a hierarchical aerial computing framework composed\nof high altitude platform (HAP) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to compute\nthe fully offloaded tasks of terrestrial mobile users which are connected\nthrough an uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (UL-NOMA). To better assess\nthe freshness of information in computation-intensive applications the\ncriterion of age of information (AoI) is considered. In particular, the problem\nis formulated to minimize the average AoI of users with elastic tasks, by\nadjusting UAVs trajectory and resource allocation on both UAVs and HAP, which\nis restricted by the channel state information (CSI) uncertainty and multiple\nresource constraints of UAVs and HAP. In order to solve this non-convex\noptimization problem, two methods of multi-agent deep deterministic policy\ngradient (MADDPG) and federated reinforcement learning (FRL) are proposed to\ndesign the UAVs trajectory, and obtain channel, power, and CPU allocations. It\nis shown that task scheduling significantly reduces the average AoI. This\nimprovement is more pronounced for larger task sizes. On one hand, it is shown\nthat power allocation has a marginal effect on the average AoI compared to\nusing full transmission power for all users. Compared with traditional\ntransmission schemes, the simulation results show our scheduling scheme results\nin a substantial improvement in average AoI.",

Furthermore, we found that this low-energy\neffective theory around almost unstable regions reduces to a simple quantum\nmechanical system, and the vacuum life-time can be calculated using known\nresults, even beyond the WKB approximation. Finally, we compare the life-time\nof the vacuum with the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) and find\nthat as long as the string scale is at least one order magnitude smaller than\nthe Planck scale, there is a nonzero window to satisfy the TCC condition.",

      "abstract": "Traditional recommender systems estimate user preference on items purely\nbased on historical interaction records, thus failing to capture fine-grained\nyet dynamic user interests and letting users receive recommendation only\npassively. Recent conversational recommender systems (CRSs) tackle those\nlimitations by enabling recommender systems to interact with the user to obtain\nher/his current preference through a sequence of clarifying questions. Despite\nthe progress achieved in CRSs, existing solutions are far from satisfaction in\nthe following two aspects: 1) current CRSs usually require each user to answer\na quantity of clarifying questions before reaching the final recommendation,\nwhich harms the user experience; 2) there is a semantic gap between the learned\nrepresentations of explicitly mentioned attributes and items. To address these\ndrawbacks, we introduce the knowledge graph (KG) as the auxiliary information\nfor comprehending and reasoning a user's preference, and propose a new CRS\nframework, namely Knowledge Enhanced Conversational Reasoning (KECR) system. As\na user can reflect her/his preference via both attribute- and item-level\nexpressions, KECR closes the semantic gap between two levels by embedding the\nstructured knowledge in the KG. Meanwhile, KECR utilizes the connectivity\nwithin the KG to conduct explicit reasoning of the user demand, making the\nmodel less dependent on the user's feedback to clarifying questions. KECR can\nfind a prominent reasoning chain to make the recommendation explainable and\nmore rationale, as well as smoothen the conversation process, leading to better\nuser experience and conversational recommendation accuracy. Extensive\nexperiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate our approach's superiority\nover state-of-the-art baselines in both automatic evaluations and human\njudgments.",

      "abstract": "Generating talking person portraits with arbitrary speech audio is a crucial\nproblem in the field of digital human and metaverse. A modern talking face\ngeneration method is expected to achieve the goals of generalized audio-lip\nsynchronization, good video quality, and high system efficiency. Recently,\nneural radiance field (NeRF) has become a popular rendering technique in this\nfield since it could achieve high-fidelity and 3D-consistent talking face\ngeneration with a few-minute-long training video. However, there still exist\nseveral challenges for NeRF-based methods: 1) as for the lip synchronization,\nit is hard to generate a long facial motion sequence of high temporal\nconsistency and audio-lip accuracy; 2) as for the video quality, due to the\nlimited data used to train the renderer, it is vulnerable to out-of-domain\ninput condition and produce bad rendering results occasionally; 3) as for the\nsystem efficiency, the slow training and inference speed of the vanilla NeRF\nseverely obstruct its usage in real-world applications. In this paper, we\npropose GeneFace++ to handle these challenges by 1) utilizing the pitch contour\nas an auxiliary feature and introducing a temporal loss in the facial motion\nprediction process; 2) proposing a landmark locally linear embedding method to\nregulate the outliers in the predicted motion sequence to avoid robustness\nissues; 3) designing a computationally efficient NeRF-based motion-to-video\nrenderer to achieves fast training and real-time inference. With these\nsettings, GeneFace++ becomes the first NeRF-based method that achieves stable\nand real-time talking face generation with generalized audio-lip\nsynchronization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in terms of subjective and objective evaluation.\nVideo samples are available at https://genefaceplusplus.github.io .",

However, DNS traffic is still largely\nunencrypted, which allows user profiles to be derived from plaintext DNS\nqueries. While DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH) address this problem\nby leveraging transport encryption for DNS, both protocols are constrained by\nthe underlying transport (TCP) and encryption (TLS) protocols, requiring\nmultiple round-trips to establish a secure connection. In contrast, QUIC\ncombines the transport and cryptographic handshake into a single round-trip,\nwhich allows the recently standardized DNS over QUIC (DoQ) to provide DNS\nprivacy with minimal latency. In the first study of its kind, we perform\ndistributed DoQ measurements across multiple vantage points to evaluate the\nimpact of DoQ on Web performance. We find that DoQ excels over DoH, leading to\nsignificant improvements with up to 10% faster loads for simple webpages. With\nincreasing complexity of webpages, DoQ even catches up to DNS over UDP (DoUDP)\nas the cost of encryption amortizes: With DoQ being only ~2% slower than DoUDP,\nencrypted DNS becomes much more appealing for the Web.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning models have achieved remarkable success in various\nreal-world applications such as data science, computer vision, and natural\nlanguage processing. However, model training in machine learning requires\nlarge-scale data sets and multiple iterations before it can work properly.\nParallelization of training algorithms is a common strategy to speed up the\nprocess of training. However, many studies on model training and inference\nfocus only on aspects of performance. Power consumption is also an important\nmetric for any type of computation, especially high-performance applications.\nMachine learning algorithms that can be used on low-power platforms such as\nsensors and mobile devices have been researched, but less power optimization is\ndone for algorithms designed for high-performance computing.\n  In this paper, we present a C++ implementation of logistic regression and the\ngenetic algorithm, and a Python implementation of neural networks with\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm on classification tasks. We will\nshow the impact that the complexity of the model and the size of the training\ndata have on the parallel efficiency of the algorithm in terms of both power\nand performance. We also tested these implementations using shard-memory\nparallelism, distributed memory parallelism, and GPU acceleration to speed up\nmachine learning model training.",

      "title": "A Dynamic Model for Frequency Response Optimization in Photovoltaic\n  Visible Light Communication",
      "abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) modules are recently employed in photovoltaic visible light\ncommunication (PVLC) for simultaneous energy harvesting and visible light\ncommunication. A PV-based receiver features large signal output, easy optical\nalignment, and self-powered operation. However, PV modules usually have a\nsevere bandwidth limitation when used as passive photodetectors. In this paper,\nwe systematically investigate the internal impedance dynamic of PV modules and\nhow that affects their frequency response characteristics under different\nilluminances. We propose a simplified yet accurate dynamic PV mode AC detection\nmodel to capture the frequency response characteristics of a PVLC receiver. The\nmodel is validated with the impedance spectroscopy characterization\nmethodologies. Experimental results show that a PV module's internal resistance\nand capacitance depend on incident illuminance, affecting PV's frequency\nresponse. The bandwidth is exacerbated under indoor environments with low\nilluminance levels due to the increment of internal resistance for PV modules.\nThe RC constant can be reduced for PVLC receivers working near open-circuit\nvoltage conditions by adding a moderate local light to decrease the internal\nresistance value. For practical implementation, PVLC receivers will employ a\nload for data recovery. We show that adjusting the forward bias conditions can\nsimultaneously reduce the resistance and capacitance values. With the\noptimization of equivalent trans-impedance, the data rate of a Cadmium\ntelluride (CdTe) PV module achieves a 3.8 times enhancement under 200 lux. We\nalso demonstrate that the BER of a 5-Mbit/s eight-level pulse amplitude\nmodulation (PAM8) signal can be reduced from 9.8*10-2 to 1.4*10-3 by maximizing\nthe transimpedance gain-bandwidth product.",

However, deep\nforest, as a cascade of random forests, possesses interpretability only at the\nfirst layer. From the second layer on, many of the tree splits occur on the new\nfeatures generated by the previous layer, which makes existing explanatory\ntools for random forests inapplicable.

      "abstract": "In exoplanetary systems, the interaction between the central star and the\nplanet can trigger Auroral Radio Emission (ARE), due to the Electron Cyclotron\nMaser mechanism. The high brightness temperature of this emission makes it\nvisible at large distances, opening new opportunities to study exoplanets and\nto search for favourable conditions for the development of extra-terrestrial\nlife, as magnetic fields act as a shield that protects life against external\nparticles and influences the evolution of the planetary atmospheres. In the\nlast few years, we started an observational campaign to observe a sample of\nnearby M-type stars known to host exoplanets with the aim to detect ARE. We\nobserved YZ Ceti with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in\nband 4 (550-900 MHz) nine times over a period of five months. We detected radio\nemission four times, two of which with high degree of circular polarization.\nWith statistical considerations we exclude the possibility of flares due to\nstellar magnetic activity. Instead, when folding the detections to the orbital\nphase of the closest planet YZ Cet b, they are at positions where we would\nexpect ARE due to star-planet interaction (SPI) in sub-Alfvenic regime. With a\ndegree of confidence higher than 4.37 sigma, YZ Cet is the first extrasolar\nsystems with confirmed SPI at radio wavelengths. Modelling the ARE, we estimate\na magnetic field for the star of about 2.4 kG and we find that the planet must\nhave a magnetosphere.

In particular, we design the first efficient constant approximation\nalgorithm for the problem and show that, under a natural monotonicity\nassumption on the payoffs, its approximation guarantee (almost) matches the\nstate-of-the-art for the special and well-studied class of recharging bandits\n(also known as delay-dependent). In this attempt, we develop new tools and\ninsights for this class of problems, including a novel higher-dimensional\nrelaxation and the technique of mirroring the evolution of virtual states. We\nbelieve that these novel elements could potentially be used for approaching\nricher classes of action-induced nonstationary bandits (e.g., special instances\nof restless bandits). In the case where the model parameters are initially\nunknown, we develop an online learning adaptation of our algorithm for which we\nprovide sublinear regret guarantees against its full-information counterpart.",

      "abstract": "Works on implicit regularization have studied gradient trajectories during\nthe optimization process to explain why deep networks favor certain kinds of\nsolutions over others. In deep linear networks, it has been shown that gradient\ndescent implicitly regularizes toward low-rank solutions on matrix\ncompletion/factorization tasks. Adding depth not only improves performance on\nthese tasks but also acts as an accelerative pre-conditioning that further\nenhances this bias towards low-rankedness. Inspired by this, we propose an\nexplicit penalty to mirror this implicit bias which only takes effect with\ncertain adaptive gradient optimizers (e.g. Adam). This combination can enable a\ndegenerate single-layer network to achieve low-rank approximations with\ngeneralization error comparable to deep linear networks, making depth no longer\nnecessary for learning. The single-layer network also performs competitively or\nout-performs various approaches for matrix completion over a range of parameter\nand data regimes despite its simplicity. Together with an optimizer's inductive\nbias, our findings suggest that explicit regularization can play a role in\ndesigning different, desirable forms of regularization and that a more nuanced\nunderstanding of this interplay may be necessary.",

      "abstract": "Datasets often have their intrinsic symmetries, and particular deep-learning\nmodels called equivariant or invariant models have been developed to exploit\nthese symmetries. However, if some or all of these symmetries are only\napproximate, which frequently happens in practice, these models may be\nsuboptimal due to the architectural restrictions imposed on them. We tackle\nthis issue of approximate symmetries in a setup where symmetries are mixed,\ni.e., they are symmetries of not single but multiple different types and the\ndegree of approximation varies across these types. Instead of proposing a new\narchitectural restriction as in most of the previous approaches, we present a\nregularizer-based method for building a model for a dataset with mixed\napproximate symmetries. The key component of our method is what we call\nequivariance regularizer for a given type of symmetries, which measures how\nmuch a model is equivariant with respect to the symmetries of the type. Our\nmethod is trained with these regularizers, one per each symmetry type, and the\nstrength of the regularizers is automatically tuned during training, leading to\nthe discovery of the approximation levels of some candidate symmetry types\nwithout explicit supervision. Using synthetic function approximation and motion\nforecasting tasks, we demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than\nprior approaches while discovering the approximate symmetry levels correctly.",

Their fast\nswitching frequencies make them attractive alternatives to conventional ceramic\nferroelectrics, which contain rare and/or toxic elements, and require high\nprocessing temperatures. In this study, we mined the Cambridge Structural\nDatabase for potential OPTFes, uncovering all previously reported compounds,\nboth tautomers and co-crystals, in addition to seven new candidate tautomers.\nThe mining was based on identifying polar crystal structures with pseudo\ncenter-of-symmetry and viable PT paths. The spontaneous polarization and PT\nbarriers were assessed using density functional theory.",

      "abstract": "With the rise of specialized hardware and new programming languages, code\noptimization has shifted its focus towards promoting data locality. Most\nproduction-grade compilers adopt a control-centric mindset - instruction-driven\noptimization augmented with scalar-based dataflow - whereas other approaches\nprovide domain-specific and general purpose data movement minimization, which\ncan miss important control-flow optimizations. As the two representations are\nnot commutable, users must choose one over the other. In this paper, we explore\nhow both control- and data-centric approaches can work in tandem via the\nMulti-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) framework. Through a combination\nof an MLIR dialect and specialized passes, we recover parametric, symbolic\ndataflow that can be optimized within the DaCe framework. We combine the two\nviews into a single pipeline, called DCIR, showing that it is strictly more\npowerful than either view. On several benchmarks and a real-world application\nin C, we show that our proposed pipeline consistently outperforms MLIR and\nautomatically uncovers new optimization opportunities with no additional\neffort.",

      "abstract": "Dynamical systems with complex behaviours, e.g. immune system cells\ninteracting with a pathogen, are commonly modelled by splitting the behaviour\ninto different regimes, or modes, each with simpler dynamics, and then learning\nthe switching behaviour from one mode to another. Switching Dynamical Systems\n(SDS) are a powerful tool that automatically discovers these modes and\nmode-switching behaviour from time series data. While effective, these methods\nfocus on independent objects, where the modes of one object are independent of\nthe modes of the other objects. In this paper, we focus on the more general\ninteracting object setting for switching dynamical systems, where the\nper-object dynamics also depends on an unknown and dynamically changing subset\nof other objects and their modes. To this end, we propose a novel graph-based\napproach for switching dynamical systems, GRAph Switching dynamical Systems\n(GRASS), in which we use a dynamic graph to characterize interactions between\nobjects and learn both intra-object and inter-object mode-switching behaviour.\nWe introduce two new datasets for this setting, a synthesized ODE-driven\nparticles dataset and a real-world Salsa Couple Dancing dataset.

The strategic behavior of DRPs is modeled in a game-theoretic\nframework using a generalized Stackelberg game. Further, the existence and\nuniqueness of the game are validated using variational inequalities. It is\npresented as a nonlinear problem to consider AC network constraints. An\nequilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints is used as a mathematical\nprogram to model the multi-leader-multi-follower, bi-level problem, which is\nsimultaneously solved for all DRPs. The diagonalization method is employed to\nsolve the problem.

In stark contrast to existing\ndata-driven methods, which typically require long offline training time, are\nprone to visual artifacts, and tend to fail on large and complex skeletons,\nGenMM inherits the training-free nature and the superior quality of the\nwell-known Motion Matching method. GenMM can synthesize a high-quality motion\nwithin a fraction of a second, even with highly complex and large skeletal\nstructures. At the heart of our generative framework lies the generative motion\nmatching module, which utilizes the bidirectional visual similarity as a\ngenerative cost function to motion matching, and operates in a multi-stage\nframework to progressively refine a random guess using exemplar motion matches.\nIn addition to diverse motion generation, we show the versatility of our\ngenerative framework by extending it to a number of scenarios that are not\npossible with motion matching alone, including motion completion, key\nframe-guided generation, infinite looping, and motion reassembly.

      "abstract": "E-commerce websites (e.g. Amazon) have a plethora of structured and\nunstructured information (text and images) present on the product pages.\nSellers often either don't label or mislabel values of the attributes (e.g.\ncolor, size etc.) for their products. Automatically identifying these attribute\nvalues from an eCommerce product page that contains both text and images is a\nchallenging task, especially when the attribute value is not explicitly\nmentioned in the catalog. In this paper, we present a scalable solution for\nthis problem where we pose attribute extraction problem as a question-answering\ntask, which we solve using \\textbf{MXT}, consisting of three key components:\n(i) \\textbf{M}AG (Multimodal Adaptation Gate), (ii) \\textbf{X}ception network,\nand (iii) \\textbf{T}5 encoder-decoder. Our system consists of a generative\nmodel that \\emph{generates} attribute-values for a given product by using both\ntextual and visual characteristics (e.g. images) of the product. We show that\nour system is capable of handling zero-shot attribute prediction (when\nattribute value is not seen in training data) and value-absent prediction (when\nattribute value is not mentioned in the text) which are missing in traditional\nclassification-based and NER-based models respectively. We have trained our\nmodels using distant supervision, removing dependency on human labeling, thus\nmaking them practical for real-world applications. With this framework, we are\nable to train a single model for 1000s of (product-type, attribute) pairs, thus\nreducing the overhead of training and maintaining separate models. Extensive\nexperiments on two real world datasets show that our framework improves the\nabsolute recall@90P by 10.16\\% and 6.9\\% from the existing state of the art\nmodels. In a popular e-commerce store, we have deployed our models for 1000s of\n(product-type, attribute) pairs.",

The challenge\nthen becomes how to determine which information is useful and which ones should\nbe eliminated. This process is known as meta-decision. Likewise, when it comes\nto using Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for strategic decision-making,\nplacing trust in the AI itself becomes a meta-decision, given that many AI\nsystems are viewed as opaque \"black boxes\" that process large amounts of data.\nTrusting an opaque system involves deciding on the level of Trustworthy AI\n(TAI). We propose a new approach to address this issue by introducing a novel\ntaxonomy or framework of TAI, which encompasses three crucial domains:\narticulate, authentic, and basic for different levels of trust. To underpin\nthese domains, we create ten dimensions to measure trust:\nexplainability/transparency, fairness/diversity, generalizability, privacy,\ndata governance, safety/robustness, accountability, reproducibility,\nreliability, and sustainability. We aim to use this taxonomy to conduct a\ncomprehensive survey and explore different TAI approaches from a strategic\ndecision-making perspective.",

      "title": "Better Context Makes Better Code Language Models: A Case Study on\n  Function Call Argument Completion",
      "abstract": "Pretrained code language models have enabled great progress towards program\nsynthesis. However, common approaches only consider in-file local context and\nthus miss information and constraints imposed by other parts of the codebase\nand its external dependencies. Existing code completion benchmarks also lack\nsuch context. To resolve these restrictions we curate a new dataset of\npermissively licensed Python packages that includes full projects and their\ndependencies and provide tools to extract non-local information with the help\nof program analyzers. We then focus on the task of function call argument\ncompletion which requires predicting the arguments to function calls. We show\nthat existing code completion models do not yield good results on our\ncompletion task. To better solve this task, we query a program analyzer for\ninformation relevant to a given function call, and consider ways to provide the\nanalyzer results to different code completion models during inference and\ntraining. Our experiments show that providing access to the function\nimplementation and function usages greatly improves the argument completion\nperformance. Our ablation study provides further insights on how different\ntypes of information available from the program analyzer and different ways of\nincorporating the information affect the model performance.",

      "abstract": "Color-guided depth super-resolution (DSR) is an encouraging paradigm that\nenhances a low-resolution (LR) depth map guided by an extra high-resolution\n(HR) RGB image from the same scene. Existing methods usually use interpolation\nto upscale the depth maps before feeding them into the network and transfer the\nhigh-frequency information extracted from HR RGB images to guide the\nreconstruction of depth maps. However, the extracted high-frequency information\nusually contains textures that are not present in depth maps in the existence\nof the cross-modality gap, and the noises would be further aggravated by\ninterpolation due to the resolution gap between the RGB and depth images. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose a novel Symmetric Uncertainty-aware Feature\nTransmission (SUFT) for color-guided DSR. (1) For the resolution gap, SUFT\nbuilds an iterative up-and-down sampling pipeline, which makes depth features\nand RGB features spatially consistent while suppressing noise amplification and\nblurring by replacing common interpolated pre-upsampling. (2) For the\ncross-modality gap, we propose a novel Symmetric Uncertainty scheme to remove\nparts of RGB information harmful to the recovery of HR depth maps. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets and challenging real-world settings suggest\nthat our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods.

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in vision backbones have significantly improved their\nperformance by simultaneously modeling images' local and global contexts.\nHowever, the bidirectional interaction between these two contexts has not been\nwell explored and exploited, which is important in the human visual system.\nThis paper proposes a Fully Adaptive Self-Attention (FASA) mechanism for vision\ntransformer to model the local and global information as well as the\nbidirectional interaction between them in context-aware ways. Specifically,\nFASA employs self-modulated convolutions to adaptively extract local\nrepresentation while utilizing self-attention in down-sampled space to extract\nglobal representation. Subsequently, it conducts a bidirectional adaptation\nprocess between local and global representation to model their interaction. In\naddition, we introduce a fine-grained downsampling strategy to enhance the\ndown-sampled self-attention mechanism for finer-grained global perception\ncapability. Based on FASA, we develop a family of lightweight vision backbones,\nFully Adaptive Transformer (FAT) family. Extensive experiments on multiple\nvision tasks demonstrate that FAT achieves impressive performance. Notably, FAT\naccomplishes a 77.6% accuracy on ImageNet-1K using only 4.5M parameters and\n0.7G FLOPs, which surpasses the most advanced ConvNets and Transformers with\nsimilar model size and computational costs.

Next, after introducing datasets and\nevaluation metrics applied to assess the fairness of recommender systems, we\nwill delve into the significant influence that fairness-aware recommender\nsystems exert on real-world industrial applications. Subsequently, we highlight\nthe connection between fairness and other principles of trustworthy recommender\nsystems, aiming to consider trustworthiness principles holistically while\nadvocating for fairness.

      "abstract": "The imbalance between the supply and demand of healthcare resources is a\nglobal challenge, which is particularly severe in developing countries.\nGovernments and academic communities have made various efforts to increase\nhealthcare supply and improve resource allocation. However, these efforts often\nremain passive and inflexible. Alongside these issues, the emergence of the\nparallel healthcare system has the potential to solve these problems by\nunlocking the data value. The parallel healthcare system comprises\nMedicine-Oriented Operating Systems (MOOS), Medicine-Oriented Scenario\nEngineering (MOSE), and Medicine-Oriented Large Models (MOLMs), which could\ncollect, circulate, and empower data. In this paper, we propose that achieving\nequilibrium in medical resource allocation is possible through parallel\nhealthcare systems via data empowerment. The supply-demand relationship can be\nbalanced in parallel healthcare systems by (1) increasing the supply provided\nby digital and robotic doctors in MOOS, (2) identifying individual and\npotential demands by proactive diagnosis and treatment in MOSE, and (3)\nimproving supply-demand matching using large models in MOLMs. To illustrate the\neffectiveness of this approach, we present a case study optimizing resource\nallocation from the perspective of facility accessibility. Results demonstrate\nthat the parallel healthcare system could result in up to 300% improvement in\naccessibility.",

We specifically use a multilingual AWE model\ntrained on labelled data from well-resourced languages to spot keywords in data\nin the unseen target language. In contrast to ASR, the AWE approach only\nrequires a few keyword exemplars. In controlled experiments on Wolof and\nSwahili where training and test data are from the same domain, an ASR model\ntrained on just five minutes of data outperforms the AWE approach.

      "abstract": "Model predictive control (MPC) is promising for fueling and core density\nfeedback control in nuclear fusion tokamaks, where the primary actuators,\nfrozen hydrogen fuel pellets fired into the plasma, are discrete. Previous\ndensity feedback control approaches have only approximated pellet injection as\na continuous input due to the complexity that it introduces. In this letter, we\nmodel plasma density and pellet injection as a hybrid system and propose two\nMPC strategies for density control: mixed-integer (MI) MPC using a conventional\nmixed-integer programming (MIP) solver and MPC utilizing our novel modification\nof the penalty term homotopy (PTH) algorithm. By relaxing the integer\nrequirements, the PTH algorithm transforms the MIP problem into a series of\ncontinuous optimization problems, reducing computational complexity. Our novel\nmodification to the PTH algorithm ensures that it can handle path constraints,\nmaking it viable for constrained hybrid MPC in general. Both strategies perform\nwell with regards to reference tracking without violating path constraints and\nsatisfy the computation time limit for real-time control of the pellet\ninjection system. However, the computation time of the PTH-based MPC strategy\nconsistently outpaces the conventional MI-MPC strategy.",

In equilibrium, we identify these constants with the\nlow- and high-frequency limit of the spectral density, respectively; thus, the\nspectrum at arbitrary frequency is bounded by the short- and long-time behavior\nof the observable. Out of equilibrium, on the other hand, the constants can no\nlonger be identified with the limiting behavior of the spectrum, allowing for\npeaks that correspond to oscillations in the dynamics.

The viscosity of the fluid is modelled as an exponential\nfunction of temperature and concentration, with an activation energy parameter\ndetermining its sensitivity to temperature variation. Three scenarios are\nconsidered: buoyancy force due to thermal diffusion only, buoyancy force due to\ntemperature and solute acting in the same direction, and buoyancy force due to\ntemperature and solute acting in opposite directions. A generalized eigenvalue\nproblem is derived and solved numerically for linear stability analysis via the\nChebyshev spectral collocation method. Results indicate that higher values of\nthe activation energy parameter lead to increased flow stability. Additionally,\nwhen both buoyant forces act in opposite directions, the Schmidt number has\nboth stabilizing and destabilizing effects across the range of activation\nenergy parameters, similar to the case of pure thermal diffusion. Furthermore,\nthe solutal-buoyancy-opposed base flow is found to be the most stable, while\nthe solutal-buoyancy-assisted base flow is the least stable. As expected, an\nincrease in Reynolds number is shown to decrease the critical Rayleigh number.",

We demonstrate superior\nperformance in retrieval on two datasets (ReMuQ and OK-VQA) under zero-shot\nsettings as well as further improvements when finetuned on these datasets.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a speaker verification method by an Attentive\nMulti-scale Convolutional Recurrent Network (AMCRN). The proposed AMCRN can\nacquire both local spatial information and global sequential information from\nthe input speech recordings. In the proposed method, logarithm Mel spectrum is\nextracted from each speech recording and then fed to the proposed AMCRN for\nlearning speaker embedding. Afterwards, the learned speaker embedding is fed to\nthe back-end classifier (such as cosine similarity metric) for scoring in the\ntesting stage. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods\nfor speaker verification. Experimental data are three public datasets that are\nselected from two large-scale speech corpora (VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2).\nExperimental results show that our method exceeds baseline methods in terms of\nequal error rate and minimal detection cost function, and has advantages over\nmost of baseline methods in terms of computational complexity and memory\nrequirement. In addition, our method generalizes well across truncated speech\nsegments with different durations, and the speaker embedding learned by the\nproposed AMCRN has stronger generalization ability across two back-end\nclassifiers.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes and evaluates a novel architecture for a low-power\nTime-to-Digital Converter with high resolution, optimized for both integration\nin multichannel chips and high rate operation (40 Mconversion/s/channel). This\nconverter is based on a three-step architecture. The first step uses a counter\nwhereas the following ones are based on two kinds of Delay Line structures. A\nprogrammable time amplifier is used between the second and third steps to reach\nthe final resolution of 24.4 ps in the standard mode of operation. The system\nmakes use of common continuously stabilized master blocks that control\ntrimmable slave blocks, in each channel, against the effects of global PVT\nvariations. Thanks to this structure, the power consumption of a channel is\nconsiderably reduced when it does not process a hit, and limited to 2.2 mW when\nit processes a hit. In the 130 nm CMOS technology used for the prototype, the\narea of a TDC channel is only 0.051 mm2. This compactness combined with low\npower consumption is a key advantage for integration in multi-channel front-end\nchips. The performance of this new structure has been evaluated on prototype\nchips. Measurements show excellent timing performance over a wide range of\noperating temperatures (-40{\\deg}C to 60{\\deg}C) in agreement with our\nexpectations. For example, the measured timing integral nonlinearity is better\nthan 1 LSB (25 ps) and the overall timing precision is better than 21 ps RMS.",

We thus explore\nstrategies to make the best of the strengths of different paradigms.\nExperiments show that generation models can be a promising platform to\nincorporate different paradigms.

Numerical simulation of molecular aggregate absorption and\nfluorescence spectra with intra- and intermolecular vibrational modes,\nincluding quadratic electron-vibrational (vibronic) coupling term, which is due\nto vibrational frequency shift upon pigment excitation is presented. Simulated\nabsorption and fluorescence spectra of J type molecular dimer with high\nfrequency intramolecular vibrational modes obtained with D2 and sqD2 ansatze\nmatches spectra of mD2 ansatz only in the single pigment model without\nquadratic vibronic coupling. In general, the use of mD2 ansatz is required to\nmodel accurate dimer and larger aggregate's spectra. For a J dimer aggregate\ncoupled to a low frequency intermolecular phonon bath, absorption and\nfluorescence spectra are qualitatively similar using all three ansatze. The\nquadratic vibronic coupling term in both absorption and fluorescence spectra\nmanifests itself as a lineshape peak amplitude redistribution, static frequency\nshift and an additional shift, which is temperature dependent.

The main\nchallenges of this task arise from low-contrast, small objects, and mimicry of\naquatic organisms. The key to addressing these challenges is to focus the model\non obtaining more discriminative information. We observe that the edges of\nunderwater objects are highly unique and can be distinguished from low-contrast\nor mimicry environments based on their edges. Motivated by this observation, we\npropose an Edge-guided Representation Learning Network, termed ERL-Net, that\naims to achieve discriminative representation learning and aggregation under\nthe guidance of edge cues. Firstly, we introduce an edge-guided attention\nmodule to model the explicit boundary information, which generates more\ndiscriminative features. Secondly, a feature aggregation module is proposed to\naggregate the multi-scale discriminative features by regrouping them into three\nlevels, effectively aggregating global and local information for locating and\nrecognizing underwater objects. Finally, we propose a wide and asymmetric\nreceptive field block to enable features to have a wider receptive field,\nallowing the model to focus on more small object information. Comprehensive\nexperiments on three challenging underwater datasets show that our method\nachieves superior performance on the UOD task.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, \"U-shaped\" neural networks featuring encoder and decoder\nstructures have gained popularity in the field of medical image segmentation.\nVarious variants of this model have been developed. Nevertheless, the\nevaluation of these models has received less attention compared to model\ndevelopment. In response, we propose a comprehensive method for evaluating\nmedical image segmentation models for multi-indicator and multi-organ (named\nMIMO). MIMO allows models to generate independent thresholds which are then\ncombined with multi-indicator evaluation and confidence estimation to screen\nand measure each organ. As a result, MIMO offers detailed information on the\nsegmentation of each organ in each sample, thereby aiding developers in\nanalyzing and improving the model. Additionally, MIMO can produce concise\nusability and comprehensiveness scores for different models. Models with higher\nscores are deemed to be excellent models, which is convenient for clinical\nevaluation. Our research tests eight different medical image segmentation\nmodels on two abdominal multi-organ datasets and evaluates them from four\nperspectives: correctness, confidence estimation, Usable Region and MIMO.\nFurthermore, robustness experiments are tested. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MIMO offers novel insights into multi-indicator and\nmulti-organ medical image evaluation and provides a specific and concise\nmeasure for the usability and comprehensiveness of the model.

      "abstract": "Radio transient searches using traditional variability metrics struggle to\nrecover sources whose evolution timescale is significantly longer than the\nsurvey cadence. Motivated by the recent observations of slowly evolving radio\nafterglows at gigahertz frequency, we present the results of a search for radio\nvariables and transients using an alternative matched-filter approach. We\ndesigned our matched-filter to recover sources with radio light curves that\nhave a high-significance fit to power-law and smoothly broken power-law\nfunctions; light curves following these functions are characteristic of\nsynchrotron transients, including \"orphan\" gamma-ray burst afterglows, which\nwere the primary targets of our search. Applying this matched-filter approach\nto data from Variables and Slow Transients Pilot Survey conducted using the\nAustralian SKA Pathfinder, we produced five candidates in our search.\nSubsequent Australia Telescope Compact Array observations and analysis revealed\nthat: one is likely a synchrotron transient; one is likely a flaring active\ngalactic nucleus, exhibiting a flat-to-steep spectral transition over\n$4\\,$months; one is associated with a starburst galaxy, with the radio emission\noriginating from either star formation or an underlying slowly evolving\ntransient; and the remaining two are likely extrinsic variables caused by\ninterstellar scintillation.

Our findings pave a promising road for proximity-induced\nengineering of both ferromagnetic and long-sought antiferromagnetic chiral\nobjects in the very same 2D material, which is appealing for new information\ntechnology devices employing quantum materials.",

      "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision that involves\nsegmenting images into semantically meaningful regions at the pixel level.\nHowever, existing approaches often rely on expensive human annotations as\nsupervision for model training, limiting their scalability to large, unlabeled\ndatasets. To address this challenge, we present ZeroSeg, a novel method that\nleverages the existing pretrained vision-language (VL) model (e.g. CLIP) to\ntrain open-vocabulary zero-shot semantic segmentation models. Although acquired\nextensive knowledge of visual concepts, it is non-trivial to exploit knowledge\nfrom these VL models to the task of semantic segmentation, as they are usually\ntrained at an image level. ZeroSeg overcomes this by distilling the visual\nconcepts learned by VL models into a set of segment tokens, each summarizing a\nlocalized region of the target image. We evaluate ZeroSeg on multiple popular\nsegmentation benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO,\nin a zero-shot manner (i.e., no training or adaption on target segmentation\ndatasets). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared to\nother zero-shot segmentation methods under the same training data, while also\nperforming competitively compared to strongly supervised methods. Finally, we\nalso demonstrated the effectiveness of ZeroSeg on open-vocabulary segmentation,\nthrough both human studies and qualitative visualizations.",

      "abstract": "Fully-supervised polyp segmentation has accomplished significant triumphs\nover the years in advancing the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However,\nlabel-efficient solutions from weak supervision like scribbles are rarely\nexplored yet primarily meaningful and demanding in medical practice due to the\nexpensiveness and scarcity of densely-annotated polyp data. Besides, various\ndeployment issues, including data shifts and corruption, put forward further\nrequests for model generalization and robustness. To address these concerns, we\ndesign a framework of Spatial-Spectral Dual-branch Mutual Teaching and\nEntropy-guided Pseudo Label Ensemble Learning (S$^2$ME). Concretely, for the\nfirst time in weakly-supervised medical image segmentation, we promote the\ndual-branch co-teaching framework by leveraging the intrinsic complementarity\nof features extracted from the spatial and spectral domains and encouraging\ncross-space consistency through collaborative optimization. Furthermore, to\nproduce reliable mixed pseudo labels, which enhance the effectiveness of\nensemble learning, we introduce a novel adaptive pixel-wise fusion technique\nbased on the entropy guidance from the spatial and spectral branches. Our\nstrategy efficiently mitigates the deleterious effects of uncertainty and noise\npresent in pseudo labels and surpasses previous alternatives in terms of\nefficacy. Ultimately, we formulate a holistic optimization objective to learn\nfrom the hybrid supervision of scribbles and pseudo labels. Extensive\nexperiments and evaluation on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority\nof our method regarding in-distribution accuracy, out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, and robustness, highlighting its promising clinical\nsignificance.

We present a novel method that combines rescaled localized Radial\nBasis Function (RBF) interpolation with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to\npreserve the positivity of the determinant of the deformation gradient tensor.\nThe method involves decomposing the evaluations of the tensor at the quadrature\nnodes of the source mesh into rotation matrices and diagonal matrices of\nsingular values; computing the RBF interpolation of the quaternion\nrepresentation of rotation matrices and the singular value logarithms;\nreassembling the deformation gradient tensors at quadrature nodes of the\ndestination mesh, to be used in the assembly of the electrophysiology model\nequations. The proposed method overcomes limitations of existing interpolation\nmethods, including nested intergrid interpolation and RBF interpolation of the\ndisplacement field, that may lead to the loss of physical meaningfulness of the\nmathematical formulation and then to solver failures at the algebraic level,\ndue to negative determinant values. The proposed method enables the transfer of\nsolution variables between finite element spaces of different degrees and\nshapes and without stringent conformity requirements between different meshes,\nenhancing the flexibility and accuracy of electromechanical simulations.\nNumerical results confirm that the proposed method enables the transfer of the\ndeformation gradient tensor, allowing to successfully run simulations in cases\nwhere existing methods fail. This work provides an efficient and robust method\nfor the intergrid transfer of the deformation gradient tensor, enabling\nindependent tailoring of mesh discretizations to the particular characteristics\nof the physical components concurring to the of the multiphysics model.",

      "abstract": "Previous work has shown that the representations output by contextual\nlanguage models are more anisotropic than static type embeddings, and typically\ndisplay outlier dimensions. This seems to be true for both monolingual and\nmultilingual models, although much less work has been done on the multilingual\ncontext. Why these outliers occur and how they affect the representations is\nstill an active area of research. We investigate outlier dimensions and their\nrelationship to anisotropy in multiple pre-trained multilingual language\nmodels. We focus on cross-lingual semantic similarity tasks, as these are\nnatural tasks for evaluating multilingual representations. Specifically, we\nexamine sentence representations. Sentence transformers which are fine-tuned on\nparallel resources (that are not always available) perform better on this task,\nand we show that their representations are more isotropic. However, we aim to\nimprove multilingual representations in general. We investigate how much of the\nperformance difference can be made up by only transforming the embedding space\nwithout fine-tuning, and visualise the resulting spaces. We test different\noperations: Removing individual outlier dimensions, cluster-based isotropy\nenhancement, and ZCA whitening. We publish our code for reproducibility.",

      "abstract": "Comics is emerging as a popular medium for providing visual explanations of\nprogramming concepts and procedures. Recent research into this medium opened\nthe door to new opportunities and tools to advance teaching and learning in\ncomputing. For instance, recent research on coding strip, a form of comic strip\nwith its corresponding code, led to a new visual programming environment that\ngenerates comics from code and experience report detailing various ways coding\nstrips can be used to benefit students' learning. However, how comics can be\ndesigned and used to teach programming has not yet been documented in a\nconcise, accessible format to ease their adoption. To fill this gap, we\ndeveloped a cheat sheet that summarizes the pedagogical techniques and designs\nteachers can use in their teaching. To develop this cheat sheet, we analyzed\nprior work on coding strip, including 26 coding strips and 30 coding strip\ndesign patterns. We also formulated a concept-language-procedure framework to\ndelineate how comics can facilitate teaching in programming. To evaluate our\ncheat sheet, we presented it to 11 high school CS teachers at an annual\nconference for computer studies educators and asked them to rate its\nreadability, usefulness, organization, and their interest in using it for their\nteaching. Our analysis suggests that this cheat sheet is easy to\nread/understand, useful, well-structured, and interests teachers to further\nexplore how they can incorporate comics into their teaching.",

Recent experiments have demonstrated\ndensity-dependent transport properties of moir\\'e excitons, which could play a\nkey role for technological applications. However, the intriguing interplay\nbetween exciton-exciton interactions and moir\\'e trapping has not been well\nunderstood yet. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory of interacting\nexcitons in external potentials allowing us to tackle this highly challenging\nproblem. We find that interactions between moir\\'e excitons lead to a\ndelocalization at intermediate densities and we show how this transition can be\ntuned via twist angle and temperature.

However, multi-path uncertainty corrupts\nthe TS correctness, making OFDM systems suffer from a severe\ninter-symbol-interference (ISI). To tackle this issue, we propose a\ntiming-metric learning-based TS method assisted by a lightweight\none-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN). Specifically, the\nreceptive field of 1-D CNN is specifically designed to extract the metric\nfeatures from the classic synchronizer. Then, to combat the multi-path\nuncertainty, we employ the varying delays and gains of multi-path (the\ncharacteristics of multi-path uncertainty) to design the timing-metric\nobjective, and thus form the training labels. This is typically different from\nthe existing timing-metric objectives with respect to the timing\nsynchronization point. Our method substantively increases the completeness of\ntraining data against the multi-path uncertainty due to the complete\npreservation of metric information. By this mean, the TS correctness is\nimproved against the multi-path uncertainty. Numerical results demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generalization of the proposed TS method against the\nmulti-path uncertainty.",

However, the locality assumption of GNNs, which limits\ninformation exchange to neighboring nodes, hampers their ability to capture\nlong-range dependencies and global patterns in graphs. To address this, we\npropose a new inductive bias based on variational analysis, drawing inspiration\nfrom the Brachistochrone problem. Our framework establishes a mapping between\ndiscrete GNN models and continuous diffusion functionals. This enables the\ndesign of application-specific objective functions in the continuous domain and\nthe construction of discrete deep models with mathematical guarantees. To\ntackle over-smoothing in GNNs, we analyze the existing layer-by-layer graph\nembedding models and identify that they are equivalent to l2-norm integral\nfunctionals of graph gradients, which cause over-smoothing. Similar to\nedge-preserving filters in image denoising, we introduce total variation (TV)\nto align the graph diffusion pattern with global community topologies.\nAdditionally, we devise a selective mechanism to address the trade-off between\nmodel depth and over-smoothing, which can be easily integrated into existing\nGNNs. Furthermore, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) that\npredicts spreading flows in graphs through a neural transport equation. To\nmitigate vanishing flows, we customize the objective function to minimize\ntransportation within each community while maximizing inter-community flows.\nOur GNN models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on popular graph\nlearning benchmarks such as Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed.",

At higher concentrations of the ions, V.alginolyticus in the\npuller mode (with flagella in front of the body) tends to stay close to the\nsurface whereas in the pusher mode (with flagella behind the body) it is more\nlikely to escape from the surface. Motivated by these observations, we\nnumerically investigate the locomotion of a uniflagellated model bacterium in\nunbounded fluid and near a planar surface. In our elastohydrodynamic model, the\nboundary integral technique and Kirchhoff rod model are employed respectively\nto calculate the hydrodynamic forces on the swimmer and model the elastic\ndeformations of the flagellum consisting of a short, flexible hook and a long,\nrelatively stiff filament. Our numerical results demonstrate that hydrodynamic\ninteractions between the model bacterium and the solid wall cause the puller\ntype to be attracted to the surface, whereas the pusher type is either repelled\nfrom or attracted to the surface depending on the flagellum and hook stiffness,\nthe ion concentration (which determines the motor torque), and the cell body\naspect ratio. We also show that large deformations of a very flexible hook can\nlead to an abrupt reorientation of the cell when the bacterium encounters a\nsolid surface. These research findings can be used not only in understanding\nuniflagellated bacterial behavior but also in designing bacteria-mimicking\nmicro-robots with biomedical and environmental monitoring applications.",

      "abstract": "In modern social networks, existing style transfer methods suffer from a\nserious content leakage issue, which hampers the ability to achieve serial and\nreversible stylization, thereby hindering the further propagation of stylized\nimages in social networks. To address this problem, we propose a leak-free\nstyle transfer method based on feature steganography. Our method consists of\ntwo main components: a style transfer method that accomplishes artistic\nstylization on the original image and an image steganography method that embeds\ncontent feature secrets on the stylized image. The main contributions of our\nwork are as follows: 1) We identify and explain the phenomenon of content\nleakage and its underlying causes, which arise from content inconsistencies\nbetween the original image and its subsequent stylized image. 2) We design a\nneural flow model for achieving loss-free and biased-free style transfer. 3) We\nintroduce steganography to hide content feature information on the stylized\nimage and control the subsequent usage rights. 4) We conduct comprehensive\nexperimental validation using publicly available datasets MS-COCO and Wikiart.\nThe results demonstrate that StyleStegan successfully mitigates the content\nleakage issue in serial and reversible style transfer tasks. The SSIM\nperformance metrics for these tasks are 14.98% and 7.28% higher, respectively,\ncompared to a suboptimal baseline model.",

      "abstract": "GNN inference is a non-trivial task, especially in industrial scenarios with\ngiant graphs, given three main challenges, i.e., scalability tailored for\nfull-graph inference on huge graphs, inconsistency caused by stochastic\nacceleration strategies (e.g., sampling), and the serious redundant computation\nissue. To address the above challenges, we propose a scalable system named\nInferTurbo to boost the GNN inference tasks in industrial scenarios. Inspired\nby the philosophy of ``think-like-a-vertex\", a GAS-like (Gather-Apply-Scatter)\nschema is proposed to describe the computation paradigm and data flow of GNN\ninference. The computation of GNNs is expressed in an iteration manner, in\nwhich a vertex would gather messages via in-edges and update its state\ninformation by forwarding an associated layer of GNNs with those messages and\nthen send the updated information to other vertexes via out-edges. Following\nthe schema, the proposed InferTurbo can be built with alternative backends\n(e.g., batch processing system or graph computing system). Moreover, InferTurbo\nintroduces several strategies like shadow-nodes and partial-gather to handle\nnodes with large degrees for better load balancing. With InferTurbo, GNN\ninference can be hierarchically conducted over the full graph without sampling\nand redundant computation. Experimental results demonstrate that our system is\nrobust and efficient for inference tasks over graphs containing some hub nodes\nwith many adjacent edges. Meanwhile, the system gains a remarkable performance\ncompared with the traditional inference pipeline, and it can finish a GNN\ninference task over a graph with tens of billions of nodes and hundreds of\nbillions of edges within 2 hours.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on optimal beamforming to maximize the mean\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(RIS)-aided MISO downlink system under correlated Rician fading. The\nbeamforming problem becomes non-convex because of the unit modulus constraint\nof passive RIS elements. To tackle this, we propose a semidefinite\nrelaxation-based iterative algorithm for obtaining statistically optimal\ntransmit beamforming vector and RIS-phase shift matrix. Further, we analyze the\noutage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) to measure the performance of\nthe proposed beamforming scheme. Just like the existing works, the OP and EC\nevaluations rely on the numerical computation of the iterative algorithm, which\ndoes not clearly reveal the functional dependence of system performance on key\nparameters. Therefore, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal\nbeamforming vector and phase shift matrix along with their OP performance for\nspecial cases of the general setup. Our analysis reveals that the i.i.d. fading\nis more beneficial than the correlated case in the presence of LoS components.\nThis fact is analytically established for the setting in which the LoS is\nblocked. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the maximum mean SNR improves\nlinearly/quadratically with the number of RIS elements in the absence/presence\nof LoS component under i.i.d. fading.",

It is\ndesigned to support horizontal FL among gas companies, and vertical FL among\neach gas company and heating station within a hierarchical FL ecosystem,\nrewarding participants based on their contributions to FL. In addition, a\nhierarchical FL model aggregation approach is also proposed to improve the gas\nusage estimation performance by aggregating models at different levels of the\nhierarchy.

They made two conjectures: that LH should hold for every\nadmissible sequence of positive integers, and that LH should hold for the\n''generic'' admissible sequence of positive real numbers. In this paper, we\ngive counterexamples to the first conjecture, and show that the second\nconjecture can be either true or false, depending on the meaning of\n''generic'': we construct probabilistic processes producing sequences\nsatisfying LH with probability 1, and we construct Baire topological spaces of\nsequences for which the subspace of sequences satisfying LH is meagre. We also\nextend the main result of Gonek, Graham, and Lee, stating that the Riemann\nhypothesis is equivalent to LH for the sequence of prime numbers, to the\ncontext of Beurling generalized number systems.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we establish the existence and instability of standing wave\nfor a system of nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations arising in the two-wave\nmodel with quadratic interaction in higher space dimensions under mass\nresonance conditions. Here, we eliminate the limitation for the relationship\nbetween complex constants $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ given in \\cite{HOT}, and consider\narbitrary real positive constants $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$. First of all, according\nto the conservation identities for mass and energy, using the so-called virial\ntype estimate, we obtain that the solution for the Cauchy problem under\nconsideration blows up in finite time in $H^{1}(\\mathbb{R}^{N})\\times\nH^{1}(\\mathbb{R}^{N})$ with space dimension $N\\geq 4$. Next, for space\ndimension $N$ with $4<N<6$, we establish the existence of the ground state\nsolution for the elliptic equations corresponding to the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equations under the frequency and mass resonance by adopting\nvariational method, and further achieve the exponential decay at infinity for\nthe ground state. This implies the existence of standing wave for the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equaitons under consideration. Finally, by defining another\nconstrained minimizing problems for a pair of complex-valued functions, a\nsuitable manifold, referring to the characterization of the standing wave,\nmaking appropriate scaling and adopting virial type estimate, we attain the\ninstability of the standing wave for the equations under frequency and mass\nresonance in space dimension $N$ with $4<N<6$ by virtue of the conservations of\nmass and energy. Here, we adopt the equivalence of two constrained minimizing\nproblems defined for pairs of complex-valued and real-valued functions $(u,v)$,\nrespectively, when $(u,v)$ is a pair of real-valued functions.",

      "abstract": "Among the research efforts to segment the retinal vasculature from fundus\nimages, deep learning models consistently achieve superior performance.\nHowever, this data-driven approach is very sensitive to domain shifts. For\nfundus images, such data distribution changes can easily be caused by\nvariations in illumination conditions as well as the presence of\ndisease-related features such as hemorrhages and drusen. Since the source\ndomain may not include all possible types of pathological cases, a model that\ncan robustly recognize vessels on unseen domains is desirable but remains\nelusive, despite many proposed segmentation networks of ever-increasing\ncomplexity. In this work, we propose a contrastive variational auto-encoder\nthat can filter out irrelevant features and synthesize a latent image, named\ndeep angiogram, representing only the retinal vessels. Then segmentation can be\nreadily accomplished by thresholding the deep angiogram. The generalizability\nof the synthetic network is improved by the contrastive loss that makes the\nmodel less sensitive to variations of image contrast and noisy features.\nCompared to baseline deep segmentation networks, our model achieves higher\nsegmentation performance via simple thresholding. Our experiments show that the\nmodel can generate stable angiograms on different target domains, providing\nexcellent visualization of vessels and a non-invasive, safe alternative to\nfluorescein angiography.",

      "abstract": "Interfaces in FeCoB/MgO/FeCoB magnetic tunnel junction play a vital role in\ncontrolling their magnetic and transport properties for various applications in\nspintronics and magnetic recording media. In this work, interface structures of\na few nm thick FeCoB layers in FeCoB/MgO and MgO/FeCoB bilayers are\ncomprehensively studied using x-ray standing waves (XSW) generated by\ndepositing bilayers between Pt waveguide structures. High interface selectivity\nof nuclear resonance scattering (NRS) under the XSW technique allowed measuring\nstructure and magnetism at the two interfaces, namely FeCoB-on-MgO and\nMgO-on-FeCoB, yielding an interesting result that electron density and\nhyperfine fields are not symmetric at both interfaces. The formation of a\nhigh-density FeCoB layer at the MgO/FeCoB (FeCoB-on-MgO) interface with an\nincreased hyperfine field (~34.65 T) is attributed to the increasing volume of\nFeCo at the interface due to boron diffusion from 57FeCoB to the MgO layer.\nFurthermore, it caused unusual angular-dependent magnetic properties in\nMgO/FeCoB bilayer, whereas FeCoB/MgO is magnetically isotropic. In contrast to\nthe literature, where the unusual angular dependent in FeCoB based system is\nexplained in terms of in-plane magnetic anisotropy, present findings attributed\nthe same to the interlayer exchange coupling between bulk and interface layer\nwithin the FeCoB layer.",

Following the outburst, the accretion rate onto its WD has\nremained rather low with only occasional and minor flaring episodes, until in\nlate 2014 it entered a \"super-active\" phase (SAP) that peaked in April 2016:\nthe flux radiated by Balmer lines increased by two orders of magnitude,\naccompanied by the appearance of strong HeI, HeII, and many other emission\nlines. Following the sharp maximum, the intensity of the emission lines has\nbeen steadily decreasing, reaching back the pre-SAP levels by mid-2023. The end\nof SAP is also confirmed by the drop of $B$-band brightness to pre-SAP\nconditions and the simultaneous re-appearance of a large-amplitude flickering.\nThis suggest that the accretion disk has emptied from the extra material that\nhas driven the \"super active\" state and has completed its transfer onto the WD,\nsetting the stage for a new and probably imminent nova eruption.",

      "title": "Efficient Subclass Segmentation in Medical Images",
      "abstract": "As research interests in medical image analysis become increasingly\nfine-grained, the cost for extensive annotation also rises. One feasible way to\nreduce the cost is to annotate with coarse-grained superclass labels while\nusing limited fine-grained annotations as a complement. In this way,\nfine-grained data learning is assisted by ample coarse annotations. Recent\nstudies in classification tasks have adopted this method to achieve\nsatisfactory results. However, there is a lack of research on efficient\nlearning of fine-grained subclasses in semantic segmentation tasks. In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the hierarchical structure of\ncategories to design network architecture. Meanwhile, a task-driven data\ngeneration method is presented to make it easier for the network to recognize\ndifferent subclass categories. Specifically, we introduce a Prior Concatenation\nmodule that enhances confidence in subclass segmentation by concatenating\npredicted logits from the superclass classifier, a Separate Normalization\nmodule that stretches the intra-class distance within the same superclass to\nfacilitate subclass segmentation, and a HierarchicalMix model that generates\nhigh-quality pseudo labels for unlabeled samples by fusing only similar\nsuperclass regions from labeled and unlabeled images. Our experiments on the\nBraTS2021 and ACDC datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable\naccuracy to a model trained with full subclass annotations, with limited\nsubclass annotations and sufficient superclass annotations. Our approach offers\na promising solution for efficient fine-grained subclass segmentation in\nmedical images. Our code is publicly available here.",

      "abstract": "ASASSN-22ak is a transient discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for\nSupernovae and by Gaia in 2022 January. Although this object had been in deep\nquiescence at least for seven years before this outburst, it has been showing\nrelatively regular long (35-40 d) outbursts with intervals of 132-188 d after\nthe 2022 January outburst. This \"waking up\" phenomenon appears similar to the\nvery unusual (hydrogen-rich) WZ Sge star V3101 Cyg. Time-resolved photometry\nduring the 2023 outburst detected low-amplitude (0.05 mag) superhumps with a\nperiod of 0.042876(3) d. ASASSN-22ak appears to be very similar to CRTS\nJ112253.3-111037, which is known to have a very low mass ratio and is\nconsidered to be an object evolving close to AM CVn stars as inferred from the\nlow hydrogen and high helium content. ASASSN-22ak is likely yet another object\nhaving an evolved core and strongly depleted hydrogen in the secondary. The\ncase of ASASSN-22ak strengthens the idea that a considerable fraction of AM CVn\nstars are formed from evolved cataclysmic variables. Both ASASSN-22ak and V3101\nCyg before the initial outbursts were probably in dormant states with low\nquiescent viscosity or low mass-transfer rates. The current \"high\" states of\nASASSN-22ak and V3101 Cyg may have been induced by radiation during the initial\noutburst or these objects are simply returning to ordinary states, either in\nterms of quiescent viscosity or mass-transfer rates. We also provide updated\nsuperhump period and estimated mass ratio for CRTS J112253.3-111037.",

We develop\nInstructEval, an ICL evaluation suite to conduct a thorough assessment of these\ntechniques. The suite includes 13 open-sourced LLMs of varying scales from four\nmodel families, and covers nine tasks across three categories. Using the suite,\nwe evaluate the relative performance of seven popular instruction selection\nmethods over five metrics relevant to ICL. Our experiments reveal that using\ncurated manually-written instructions or simple instructions without any\ntask-specific descriptions often elicits superior ICL performance overall than\nthat of automatic instruction-induction methods, pointing to a lack of\ngeneralizability among the latter.

      "abstract": "Cross-validation is a widely used technique for evaluating the performance of\nprediction models. It helps avoid the optimism bias in error estimates, which\ncan be significant for models built using complex statistical learning\nalgorithms. However, since the cross-validation estimate is a random value\ndependent on observed data, it is essential to accurately quantify the\nuncertainty associated with the estimate. This is especially important when\ncomparing the performance of two models using cross-validation, as one must\ndetermine whether differences in error estimates are a result of chance\nfluctuations. Although various methods have been developed for making\ninferences on cross-validation estimates, they often have many limitations,\nsuch as stringent model assumptions This paper proposes a fast bootstrap method\nthat quickly estimates the standard error of the cross-validation estimate and\nproduces valid confidence intervals for a population parameter measuring\naverage model performance. Our method overcomes the computational challenge\ninherent in bootstrapping the cross-validation estimate by estimating the\nvariance component within a random effects model. It is just as flexible as the\ncross-validation procedure itself.

Natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) of clinical notes can use observed frequencies of\nclinical terms as predictive features for downstream applications such as\nclinical decision making and patient trajectory prediction. However, due to the\nvast number of highly similar and related clinical concepts, a more effective\nmodeling strategy is to represent clinical terms as semantic embeddings via\nrepresentation learning and use the low dimensional embeddings as feature\nvectors for predictive modeling. To achieve efficient representation,\nfine-tuning pretrained language models with biomedical knowledge graphs may\ngenerate better embeddings for biomedical terms than those from standard\nlanguage models alone.

It can be\nconceptualized as a machine translation task, wherein the objective is to\nrephrase a given query into a more comprehensive alternative. While showing\npromising results, training such a model typically requires a large parallel\ncorpus of query pairs (i.e., the original query and a reformulated query) that\nare confidential and unpublished by online code search engines. This restricts\nits practicality in software development processes. In this paper, we propose\nSSQR, a self-supervised query reformulation method that does not rely on any\nparallel query corpus. Inspired by pre-trained models, SSQR treats query\nreformulation as a masked language modeling task conducted on an extensive\nunannotated corpus of queries. SSQR extends T5 (a sequence-to-sequence model\nbased on Transformer) with a new pre-training objective named corrupted query\ncompletion (CQC), which randomly masks words within a complete query and trains\nT5 to predict the masked content. Subsequently, for a given query to be\nreformulated, SSQR identifies potential locations for expansion and leverages\nthe pre-trained T5 model to generate appropriate content to fill these gaps.\nThe selection of expansions is then based on the information gain associated\nwith each candidate. Evaluation results demonstrate that SSQR outperforms\nunsupervised baselines significantly and achieves competitive performance\ncompared to supervised methods.",

Nevertheless, we argue\nthat the noise introduced by DP mechanisms may inadvertently give rise to a\nnovel poisoning threat, specifically in the context of private knowledge\nsharing during CMARL, which remains unexplored in the literature. To address\nthis shortcoming, we present an adaptive, privacy-exploiting, and\nevasion-resilient localized poisoning attack (PeLPA) that capitalizes on the\ninherent DP-noise to circumvent anomaly detection systems and hinder the\noptimal convergence of the CMARL model. We rigorously evaluate our proposed\nPeLPA attack in diverse environments, encompassing both non-adversarial and\nmultiple-adversarial contexts. Our findings reveal that, in a medium-scale\nenvironment, the PeLPA attack with attacker ratios of 20% and 40% can lead to\nan increase in average steps to goal by 50.69% and 64.41%, respectively.\nFurthermore, under similar conditions, PeLPA can result in a 1.4x and 1.6x\ncomputational time increase in optimal reward attainment and a 1.18x and 1.38x\nslower convergence for attacker ratios of 20% and 40%, respectively.",

In this\npaper, we propose a generic unmixing framework to integrate the autoencoder\nnetwork with regularization by denoising (RED), named AE-RED. More specially,\nwe decompose the unmixing optimized problem into two subproblems. The first one\nis solved using deep autoencoders to implicitly regularize the estimates and\nmodel the mixture mechanism. The second one leverages the denoiser to bring in\nthe explicit information. In this way, both the characteristics of the deep\nautoencoder based unmixing methods and priors provided by denoisers are merged\ninto our well-designed framework to enhance the unmixing performance.\nExperiment results on both synthetic and real data sets show the superiority of\nour proposed framework compared with state-of-the-art unmixing approaches.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on an important type of black-box attacks, i.e.,\ntransfer-based adversarial attacks, where the adversary generates adversarial\nexamples by a substitute (source) model and utilize them to attack an unseen\ntarget model, without knowing its information. Existing methods tend to give\nunsatisfactory adversarial transferability when the source and target models\nare from different types of DNN architectures (e.g. ResNet-18 and Swin\nTransformer). In this paper, we observe that the above phenomenon is induced by\nthe output inconsistency problem. To alleviate this problem while effectively\nutilizing the existing DNN models, we propose a common knowledge learning (CKL)\nframework to learn better network weights to generate adversarial examples with\nbetter transferability, under fixed network architectures. Specifically, to\nreduce the model-specific features and obtain better output distributions, we\nconstruct a multi-teacher framework, where the knowledge is distilled from\ndifferent teacher architectures into one student network. By considering that\nthe gradient of input is usually utilized to generated adversarial examples, we\nimpose constraints on the gradients between the student and teacher models, to\nfurther alleviate the output inconsistency problem and enhance the adversarial\ntransferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed work can\nsignificantly improve the adversarial transferability.",

      "abstract": "Contemporary distribution network can be seen with diverse dispatchable and\nnon-dispatchable energy resources. The coordinated scheduling of these\ndispatchable resources with non-dispatchable resources can provide several\ntechno-economic and social benefits. Since, battery energy storage systems\n(BESSs) and microturbine (MT) units are capital intensive, a thorough\ninvestigation of their coordinated scheduling on pure economic basis will be an\ninteresting and challenging task while considering dynamic electricity price\nand uncertainty handling of non-dispatchable resources and load demand. This\npaper proposes a new methodology for optimal coordinated scheduling of BESSs\nand MT units considering existing renewable energy resources and dynamic\nelectricity price to maximize daily profit function of the utility by employing\na recently explored modified African buffalo optimization (MABO) algorithm. The\nkey attributes of the proposed methodology are comprised of mean price-based\nadaptive scheduling embedded within a decision mechanism system (DMS) to\nmaximize arbitrage benefits. DMS keeps a track of system states as a-priori\nthus guides the artificial intelligence based solution technique for sequential\noptimization. This may also reduce the computational burden of complex\nreal-life engineering optimization problems. Further, a novel concept of\nfictitious charges is proposed to restrict the counterproductive operational\nmanagement of BESSs. The application results investigated and compared on a\nbenchmark 33-bus test distribution system highlights the importance of the\nproposed methodology.",

However, the high viscosity\nof displacing fluid may cause problems with sand production on poorly\nconsolidated reservoirs. This work investigates the effect of polymer injection\non the sand production phenomenon using the experimental study and numerical\nmodel at a laboratory scale. The experiment uses an artificially made sandstone\nbased on the characteristics of the oil field in Kazakhstan. Polymer solution\nbased on Xanthan gum is injected into the core to study the impact of polymer\nflooding on sand production. The rheology of the polymer solution is also\nexamined using a rotational rheometer, and the power-law model fits outcomes.\nWe observe no sand production during the brine injection at various flow rate\nranges. However, the sanding is noticed when the polymer solution is injected.\nMore than 50% of cumulatively produced sand is obtained after one pore volume\nof polymer sand is injected. In the numerical part of the study, we present a\ncoupling model of DEM with CFD to describe the polymer flow in a granular\nporous medium. In the solid phase, the modified cohesive contact model\ncharacterizes the bonding mechanism between sand particles. The fluid phase is\nmodeled as a non-Newtonian fluid using a power-law model. We verify the\nnumerical model with the laboratory experiment result. The numerical model\nobserves non-uniform bond breakage when only a confining stress is applied.\nAlternatively, the injection of the polymer into the sample leads to a\nrelatively gradual decrease in bonds. The significant difference in the\npressure of the fluid results in its higher velocity, which causes intensive\nsand production at the beginning of the simulation. The ratio of medium-sized\nproduced particles is greater than the initial ratio of those before injection.",

      "abstract": "Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks regularly use ensembles.\nDevelopers need to compare different ensemble techniques to select appropriate\ntechniques for an AutoML framework from the many potential techniques. So far,\nthe comparison of ensemble techniques is often computationally expensive,\nbecause many base models must be trained and evaluated one or multiple times.\nTherefore, we present Assembled-OpenML. Assembled-OpenML is a Python tool,\nwhich builds meta-datasets for ensembles using OpenML. A meta-dataset, called\nMetatask, consists of the data of an OpenML task, the task's dataset, and\nprediction data from model evaluations for the task. We can make the comparison\nof ensemble techniques computationally cheaper by using the predictions stored\nin a metatask instead of training and evaluating base models. To introduce\nAssembled-OpenML, we describe the first version of our tool. Moreover, we\npresent an example of using Assembled-OpenML to compare a set of ensemble\ntechniques. For this example comparison, we built a benchmark using\nAssembled-OpenML and implemented ensemble techniques expecting predictions\ninstead of base models as input. In our example comparison, we gathered the\nprediction data of $1523$ base models for $31$ datasets. Obtaining the\nprediction data for all base models using Assembled-OpenML took ${\\sim} 1$ hour\nin total. In comparison, obtaining the prediction data by training and\nevaluating just one base model on the most computationally expensive dataset\ntook ${\\sim} 37$ minutes.",

      "abstract": "Many state-of-the-art automated machine learning (AutoML) systems use greedy\nensemble selection (GES) by Caruana et al. (2004) to ensemble models found\nduring model selection post hoc. Thereby, boosting predictive performance and\nlikely following Auto-Sklearn 1's insight that alternatives, like stacking or\ngradient-free numerical optimization, overfit. Overfitting in Auto-Sklearn 1 is\nmuch more likely than in other AutoML systems because it uses only low-quality\nvalidation data for post hoc ensembling. Therefore, we were motivated to\nanalyze whether Auto-Sklearn 1's insight holds true for systems with\nhigher-quality validation data. Consequently, we compared the performance of\ncovariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), state-of-the-art\ngradient-free numerical optimization, to GES on the 71 classification datasets\nfrom the AutoML benchmark for AutoGluon. We found that Auto-Sklearn's insight\ndepends on the chosen metric. For the metric ROC AUC, CMA-ES overfits\ndrastically and is outperformed by GES -- statistically significantly for\nmulti-class classification. For the metric balanced accuracy, CMA-ES does not\noverfit and outperforms GES significantly. Motivated by the successful\napplication of CMA-ES for balanced accuracy, we explored methods to stop CMA-ES\nfrom overfitting for ROC AUC. We propose a method to normalize the weights\nproduced by CMA-ES, inspired by GES, that avoids overfitting for CMA-ES and\nmakes CMA-ES perform better than or similar to GES for ROC AUC.",

      "abstract": "IF (Imbert--Fedorov) shifts which refers to a transverse micro-displacement\noccurs at the interface between two media. The estimation of such\nmicro-displacement enables a deeper understanding of light-matter interactions.\nIn this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme to investigate the IF shifts and\nincident angle sensitivity by introducing SPR sensor into the SU(1,1)\ninterferometer. By injecting two coherent states in the SU(1,1) interferometer,\nwe obtain the sensitivity of the IF shifts and incident angle based on the\nhomodyne detection. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to get the\nmaximal IF shift and the optimal IF shifts sensitivity simultaneously.\nMeanwhile, the orbit angular momentum carried by Laguerre-Gauss (LG) beam is\nunfavorable for improving the IF shift sensitivity. Furthermore, we have\ninvestigated the sensitivity of the incident angle in our scheme and found that\nit is capable of surpassing the sensitivity limit of $(6\\times\n10^{-6}){{}^\\circ}$. This allows us to achieve a more precise IF shifts\nsensitivity than the traditional weak measurement method used for IF shift\ndetection, which typically has a rotation precision limit of 0.04${{}^\\circ}$\n[Journal of Optics, 19(10), 105611].

We also discover that\nincreasing the coherent amplitude is beneficial for improving the sensitivity\nof both the IF shifts and incident angle.

For the operator learning acceleration, we\nconstruct deep neural network surrogate models for the involved PDEs. Once a\nneural operator is learned, solving a PDE requires only a forward pass of the\nneural network, and the computational cost is thus substantially reduced. The\naccelerated primal-dual method with operator learning is mesh-free, numerically\nefficient, and scalable to different types of PDEs. The acceleration\neffectiveness of these two techniques is promisingly validated by some\npreliminary numerical results.",

This framework may then act as an\nenabler for enhanced decision making and risk analysis.\n  We show that inclinometer data can be described by a latent autocorrelated\nMarkov process derived from measurements. This can be used as the transition\nmodel of a non-linear Bayesian filter. This allows for the prediction of system\nstates. This learnt latent model also allows for the detection of anomalies:\nobservations that are far from their expected value may be considered to have\n`high surprisal', that is they have a high information content relative to the\nmodel encoding represented by the learnt latent model.\n  We successfully apply the forecasting and anomaly detection techniques to a\nlarge real-world data set in a computationally efficient manner. Although this\npaper studies inclinometers in particular, the techniques are broadly\napplicable to all areas of engineering UQ and Structural Health Monitoring\n(SHM).",

      "abstract": "Detecting objects and estimating their 6D poses is essential for automated\nsystems to interact safely with the environment. Most 6D pose estimators,\nhowever, rely on a single camera frame and suffer from occlusions and\nambiguities due to object symmetries. We overcome this issue by presenting a\nnovel symmetry-aware multi-view 6D pose estimator called SyMFM6D. Our approach\nefficiently fuses the RGB-D frames from multiple perspectives in a deep\nmulti-directional fusion network and predicts predefined keypoints for all\nobjects in the scene simultaneously. Based on the keypoints and an instance\nsemantic segmentation, we efficiently compute the 6D poses by least-squares\nfitting. To address the ambiguity issues for symmetric objects, we propose a\nnovel training procedure for symmetry-aware keypoint detection including a new\nobjective function. Our SyMFM6D network significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art in both single-view and multi-view 6D pose estimation. We\nfurthermore show the effectiveness of our symmetry-aware training procedure and\ndemonstrate that our approach is robust towards inaccurate camera calibration\nand dynamic camera setups.",

      "abstract": "The Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) is an widely utilized and rigorous\nclassification test for lung function evaluation, serving as a comprehensive\ntool for lung diagnosis. Meanwhile, Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a\nrapidly advancing clinical technique that visualizes conductivity distribution\ninduced by ventilation. EIT provides additional spatial and temporal\ninformation on lung ventilation beyond traditional PFT. However, relying solely\non conventional isolated interpretations of PFT results and EIT images\noverlooks the continuous dynamic aspects of lung ventilation. This study aims\nto classify lung ventilation patterns by extracting spatial and temporal\nfeatures from the 3D EIT image series. The study uses a Variational Autoencoder\nnetwork with a MultiRes block to compress the spatial distribution in a 3D\nimage into a one-dimensional vector. These vectors are then concatenated to\ncreate a feature map for the exhibition of temporal features. A simple\nconvolutional neural network is used for classification. Data collected from\n137 subjects were finally used for training. The model is validated by ten-fold\nand leave-one-out cross-validation first. The accuracy and sensitivity of\nnormal ventilation mode are 0.95 and 1.00, and the f1-score is 0.94.\nFurthermore, we check the reliability and feasibility of the proposed pipeline\nby testing it on newly recruited nine subjects. Our results show that the\npipeline correctly predicts the ventilation mode of 8 out of 9 subjects. The\nstudy demonstrates the potential of using image series for lung ventilation\nmode classification, providing a feasible method for patient prescreening and\npresenting an alternative form of PFT.",

Specifically, each prompt and its corresponding distribution value are\npaired in the memory space, and we inject top M distribution-similar prompts\ninto the input and multi-level embeddings of DETR. Additionally, we introduce\nthe Prompt Memory Alignment (PMA) to reduce the discrepancy between the source\nand target domains by fully leveraging the domain-specific knowledge extracted\nfrom the prompt domain memory.

      "abstract": "Sand mining is a booming industry. The river sandbank is one of the primary\nsources of sand mining. Detection of potential river sandbank regions for sand\nmining directly impacts the economy, society, and environment. In the past,\nsemi-supervised and supervised techniques have been used to detect mining\nregions including sand mining. A few techniques employ multi-modal analysis\ncombining different modalities such as multi-spectral imaging, synthetic\naperture radar (\\emph{SAR}) imaging, aerial images, and point cloud data.\nHowever, the distinguishing spectral characteristics of river sandbank regions\nare yet to be fully explored. This paper provides a novel method to detect\nriver sandbank regions for sand mining using multi-spectral images without any\nlabeled data over the seasons. Association with a river stream and the\nabundance of minerals are the most prominent features of such a region. The\nproposed work uses these distinguishing features to determine the spectral\nsignature of a river sandbank region, which is robust to other high mineral\nabundance regions. It follows a two-step approach, where first, potential high\nmineral regions are detected and next, they are segregated using the presence\nof a river stream. The proposed technique provides average accuracy, precision,\nand recall of 90.75%, 85.47%, and 73.5%, respectively over the seasons from\nLandsat 8 images without using any labeled dataset.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal learning is an essential paradigm for addressing complex\nreal-world problems, where individual data modalities are typically\ninsufficient to accurately solve a given modelling task. While various deep\nlearning approaches have successfully addressed these challenges, their\nreasoning process is often opaque; limiting the capabilities for a principled\nexplainable cross-modal analysis and any domain-expert intervention. In this\npaper, we introduce SHARCS (SHARed Concept Space) -- a novel concept-based\napproach for explainable multimodal learning. SHARCS learns and maps\ninterpretable concepts from different heterogeneous modalities into a single\nunified concept-manifold, which leads to an intuitive projection of\nsemantically similar cross-modal concepts. We demonstrate that such an approach\ncan lead to inherently explainable task predictions while also improving\ndownstream predictive performance. Moreover, we show that SHARCS can operate\nand significantly outperform other approaches in practically significant\nscenarios, such as retrieval of missing modalities and cross-modal\nexplanations. Our approach is model-agnostic and easily applicable to different\ntypes (and number) of modalities, thus advancing the development of effective,\ninterpretable, and trustworthy multimodal approaches.",

We study two total search problems whose totality relies\non this result.\n  In the first problem, denoted by $\\mathsf{Schrijve}r(n,k,m)$, we are given an\naccess to a coloring of the stable $k$-subsets of $[n]$ with $m = m(n,k)$\ncolors, where $m \\leq n-2k+1$, and the goal is to find a pair of disjoint\nsubsets that are assigned the same color.

For $m = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor-2k+1$, we prove\nthat the problem is efficiently reducible to the $\\mathsf{Kneser}$ problem.\nMotivated by the relation between the problems, we investigate the family of\nunstable $k$-subsets of $[n]$, which might be of independent interest.\n  In the second problem, called Unfair Independent Set in Cycle, we are given\n$\\ell$ subsets $V_1, \\ldots, V_\\ell$ of $[n]$, where $\\ell \\leq n-2k+1$ and\n$|V_i| \\geq 2$ for all $i \\in [\\ell]$, and the goal is to find a stable\n$k$-subset $S$ of $[n]$ satisfying the constraints $|S \\cap V_i| \\leq |V_i|/2$\nfor $i \\in [\\ell]$. We prove that the problem is $\\mathsf{PPA}$-complete and\nthat its restriction to instances with $n=3k$ is at least as hard as the Cycle\nplus Triangles problem, for which no efficient algorithm is known.

      "abstract": "In computer vision applications, the following problem often arises: Given a\nfamily of (Laurent) polynomial systems with the same monomial structure but\nvarying coefficients, find a solver that computes solutions for any family\nmember as fast as possible. Under appropriate genericity assumptions, the\ndimension and degree of the respective polynomial ideal remain unchanged for\neach particular system in the same family. The state-of-the-art approach to\nsolving such problems is based on elimination templates, which are the\ncoefficient (Macaulay) matrices that encode the transformation from the initial\npolynomials to the polynomials needed to construct the action matrix. Knowing\nan action matrix, the solutions of the system are computed from its\neigenvectors. The important property of an elimination template is that it\napplies to all polynomial systems in the family. In this paper, we propose a\nnew practical algorithm that checks whether a given set of Laurent polynomials\nis sufficient to construct an elimination template. Based on this algorithm, we\npropose an automatic solver generator for systems of Laurent polynomial\nequations. The new generator is simple and fast; it applies to ideals with\npositive-dimensional components; it allows one to uncover partial $p$-fold\nsymmetries automatically. We test our generator on various minimal problems,\nmostly in geometric computer vision. The speed of the generated solvers exceeds\nthe state-of-the-art in most cases. In particular, we propose the solvers for\nthe following problems: optimal 3-view triangulation, semi-generalized hybrid\npose estimation and minimal time-of-arrival self-calibration. The experiments\non synthetic scenes show that our solvers are numerically accurate and either\ncomparable to or significantly faster than the state-of-the-art solvers.",

      "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of medical imaging diagnostics, achieving\nhigh accuracy while preserving computational efficiency remains a formidable\nchallenge. This work presents \\texttt{DeepMediX}, a groundbreaking,\nresource-efficient model that significantly addresses this challenge. Built on\ntop of the MobileNetV2 architecture, DeepMediX excels in classifying brain MRI\nscans and skin cancer images, with superior performance demonstrated on both\nbinary and multiclass skin cancer datasets. It provides a solution to\nlabor-intensive manual processes, the need for large datasets, and complexities\nrelated to image properties. DeepMediX's design also includes the concept of\nFederated Learning, enabling a collaborative learning approach without\ncompromising data privacy. This approach allows diverse healthcare institutions\nto benefit from shared learning experiences without the necessity of direct\ndata access, enhancing the model's predictive power while preserving the\nprivacy and integrity of sensitive patient data. Its low computational\nfootprint makes DeepMediX suitable for deployment on handheld devices, offering\npotential for real-time diagnostic support. Through rigorous testing on\nstandard datasets, including the ISIC2018 for dermatological research,\nDeepMediX demonstrates exceptional diagnostic capabilities, matching the\nperformance of existing models on almost all tasks and even outperforming them\nin some cases. The findings of this study underline significant implications\nfor the development and deployment of AI-based tools in medical imaging and\ntheir integration into point-of-care settings.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are debilitating psychiatric illnesses\nthat can be challenging to diagnose accurately. The similarities between the\ndiseases make it difficult to differentiate between them using traditional\ndiagnostic tools. Recently, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(rsfMRI) has emerged as a promising tool for the diagnosis of psychiatric\ndisorders. This paper presents several methods for differentiating\nschizophrenia and bipolar disorder based on features extracted from rsfMRI\ndata. The system that achieved the best results, uses 1D Convolutional Neural\nNetworks to analyze patterns of Intrinsic Connectivity time courses obtained\nfrom rsfMRI and potentially identify biomarkers that distinguish between the\ntwo disorders. We evaluate the system's performance on a large dataset of\npatients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and demonstrate that the\nsystem achieves a 0.7078 Area Under Curve (AUC) score in differentiating\npatients with these disorders. Our results suggest that rsfMRI-based\nclassification systems have great potential for improving the accuracy of\npsychiatric diagnoses and may ultimately lead to more effective treatments for\npatients with this disorder.",

The investigation encompasses both asymptotic and\nnumerical approaches. By assuming a small amplitude for the external force, we\nderive a dynamical system that describes the behavior of the solitary wave\namplitude and the position of its crest. Our findings reveal three distinct\nscenarios: (i) resonance between the solitary wave and the external force, (ii)\noscillatory motion with closed orbits, and (iii) displacement from the initial\nposition while maintaining the wave direction. However, through numerical\nsimulations, we observe a different relationship between the amplitude of the\nsolitary wave and its crest position. Specifically, for external forces of\nsmall amplitude, the simulations indicate the presence of an unstable spiral\npattern. Conversely, when subjected to external forces of larger amplitudes,\nthe solitary wave exhibits a stable spiral trajectory which resembles the\nclassical damped mass-spring system.",

We propose two new notions, O-indistinguishable\nstrategy (O-IS) and objective-indistinguishability equilibrium (OIE). For a\ngiven game and a subset O of winning objectives (or objectives in short), a\nstrategy of a player is O-indistinguishable if an adversary cannot shrink O by\nexcluding any objective from O as an impossible objective. A strategy profile,\nwhich is a tuple of strategies of all players, is an OIE if the profile is\nlocally maximal in the sense that no player can expand her set of objectives\nindistinguishable from her real objective from the viewpoint of an adversary.\nWe show that for a given multiplayer game with Muller objectives, both of the\nexistence of an O-IS and that of OIE are decidable.",

Due to its optimality guarantees and ease of\nimplementation, it has been studied extensively in the literature. However, the\nchallenges involved in implementing the GM-PHD filter efficiently in a\ndistributed (multi-sensor) setting have received little attention. The existing\nsolutions for distributed PHD filtering either have a high computational and\ncommunication cost, making them infeasible for resource-constrained\napplications, or are unable to guarantee the asymptotic convergence of the\ndistributed PHD algorithm to an optimal solution. In this paper, we develop a\ndistributed GM-PHD filtering recursion that uses a probabilistic communication\nrule to limit the communication bandwidth of the algorithm, while ensuring\nasymptotic optimality of the algorithm. We derive the convergence properties of\nthis recursion, which uses weighted average consensus of Gaussian mixtures\n(GMs) to lower (and asymptotically minimize) the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence\nbetween the sensors' local estimates. In addition, the proposed method is able\nto avoid the issue of false positives, which has previously been noted to\nimpact the filtering performance of distributed multi-target tracking. Through\nnumerical simulations, it is demonstrated that our proposed method is an\neffective solution for distributed multi-target tracking in\nresource-constrained sensor networks.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first formal theoretical\nresult on the power for the knockoffs procedure in the survival setting.\nSimulation studies confirm that our method has appealing finite-sample\nperformance with desired FDR control and high power. We further demonstrate the\nperformance of our method through a real data example.",

      "abstract": "We propose herein an extension of truncated spectrum methodologies (TSMs), a\nnon-perturbative numerical approach able to elucidate the low energy properties\nof quantum field theories. TSMs, in their various flavors, involve a division\nof a computational Hilbert space, $\\mathcal{H}$, into two parts, one part,\n$\\mathcal{H}_1$ that is `kept' for the numerical computations, and one part,\n$\\mathcal{H}_2$, that is discarded or `truncated'. Even though $\\mathcal{H}_2$\nis discarded, TSMs will often try to incorporate the effects of $\\mathcal{H}_2$\nin some effective way. In these terms, we propose to keep the dimension of\n$\\mathcal{H}_1$ small. We pair this choice of $\\mathcal{H}_1$ with a Krylov\nsubspace iterative approach able to take into account the effects of\n$\\mathcal{H}_2$. This iterative approach can be taken to arbitrarily high order\nand so offers the ability to compute quantities to arbitrary precision. In many\ncases it also offers the advantage of not needing an explicit UV cutoff. To\ncompute the matrix elements that arise in the Krylov iterations, we employ a\nFeynman diagrammatic representation that is then evaluated with Monte Carlo\ntechniques. Each order of the Krylov iteration is variational and is guaranteed\nto improve upon the previous iteration. The first Krylov iteration is akin to\nthe NLO approach of Elias-Mir\\'o et al. \\cite{Elias-Miro:2017tup}. To\ndemonstrate this approach, we focus on the $1+1d$ dimensional $\\phi^4$ model\nand compute the bulk energy and mass gaps in both the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-broken and\nunbroken sectors. We estimate the critical $\\phi^4$ coupling in the broken\nphase to be $g_c=0.2645\\pm0.002$.",

      "title": "Classes are not Clusters: Improving Label-based Evaluation of\n  Dimensionality Reduction",
      "abstract": "A common way to evaluate the reliability of dimensionality reduction (DR)\nembeddings is to quantify how well labeled classes form compact, mutually\nseparated clusters in the embeddings. This approach is based on the assumption\nthat the classes stay as clear clusters in the original high-dimensional space.\nHowever, in reality, this assumption can be violated; a single class can be\nfragmented into multiple separated clusters, and multiple classes can be merged\ninto a single cluster. We thus cannot always assure the credibility of the\nevaluation using class labels. In this paper, we introduce two novel quality\nmeasures -- Label-Trustworthiness and Label-Continuity (Label-T&C) -- advancing\nthe process of DR evaluation based on class labels. Instead of assuming that\nclasses are well-clustered in the original space, Label-T&C work by (1)\nestimating the extent to which classes form clusters in the original and\nembedded spaces and (2) evaluating the difference between the two. A\nquantitative evaluation showed that Label-T&C outperform widely used DR\nevaluation measures (e.g., Trustworthiness and Continuity, Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence) in terms of the accuracy in assessing how well DR embeddings\npreserve the cluster structure, and are also scalable. Moreover, we present\ncase studies demonstrating that Label-T&C can be successfully used for\nrevealing the intrinsic characteristics of DR techniques and their\nhyperparameters.",

      "abstract": "Learning from positive and unlabeled data is known as positive-unlabeled (PU)\nlearning in literature and has attracted much attention in recent years. One\ncommon approach in PU learning is to sample a set of pseudo-negatives from the\nunlabeled data using ad-hoc thresholds so that conventional supervised methods\ncan be applied with both positive and negative samples. Owing to the label\nuncertainty among the unlabeled data, errors of misclassifying unlabeled\npositive samples as negative samples inevitably appear and may even accumulate\nduring the training processes. Those errors often lead to performance\ndegradation and model instability. To mitigate the impact of label uncertainty\nand improve the robustness of learning with positive and unlabeled data, we\npropose a new robust PU learning method with a training strategy motivated by\nthe nature of human learning: easy cases should be learned first. Similar\nintuition has been utilized in curriculum learning to only use easier cases in\nthe early stage of training before introducing more complex cases.\nSpecifically, we utilize a novel ``hardness'' measure to distinguish unlabeled\nsamples with a high chance of being negative from unlabeled samples with large\nlabel noise. An iterative training strategy is then implemented to fine-tune\nthe selection of negative samples during the training process in an iterative\nmanner to include more ``easy'' samples in the early stage of training.\nExtensive experimental validations over a wide range of learning tasks show\nthat this approach can effectively improve the accuracy and stability of\nlearning with positive and unlabeled data.

      "abstract": "Given the time and expense associated with bringing a drug to market,\nnumerous studies have been conducted to predict the properties of compounds\nbased on their structure using machine learning. Federated learning has been\napplied to compound datasets to increase their prediction accuracy while\nsafeguarding potentially proprietary information. However, federated learning\nis encumbered by low accuracy in not identically and independently distributed\n(non-IID) settings, i.e., data partitioning has a large label bias, and is\nconsidered unsuitable for compound datasets, which tend to have large label\nbias. To address this limitation, we utilized an alternative method of\ndistributed machine learning to chemical compound data from open sources,\ncalled data collaboration analysis (DC). We also proposed data collaboration\nanalysis using projection data (DCPd), which is an improved method that\nutilizes auxiliary PubChem data. This improves the quality of individual\nuser-side data transformations for the projection data for the creation of\nintermediate representations. The classification accuracy, i.e., area under the\ncurve in the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and AUC in the\nprecision-recall curve (PR-AUC), of federated averaging (FedAvg), DC, and DCPd\nwas compared for five compound datasets. We determined that the machine\nlearning performance for non-IID settings was in the order of DCPd, DC, and\nFedAvg, although they were almost the same in identically and independently\ndistributed (IID) settings. Moreover, the results showed that compared to other\nmethods, DCPd exhibited a negligible decline in classification accuracy in\nexperiments with different degrees of label bias. Thus, DCPd can address the\nlow performance in non-IID settings, which is one of the challenges of\nfederated learning.",

Diverse distortion measures have thus been proposed to evaluate the\nreliability of DR embeddings. However, implementing and executing distortion\nmeasures in practice has so far been time-consuming and tedious. To address\nthis issue, we present ZADU, a Python library that provides distortion\nmeasures. ZADU is not only easy to install and execute but also enables\ncomprehensive evaluation of DR embeddings through three key features. First,\nthe library covers a wide range of distortion measures. Second, it\nautomatically optimizes the execution of distortion measures, substantially\nreducing the running time required to execute multiple measures. Last, the\nlibrary informs how individual points contribute to the overall distortions,\nfacilitating the detailed analysis of DR embeddings. By simulating a real-world\nscenario of optimizing DR embeddings, we verify that our optimization scheme\nsubstantially reduces the time required to execute distortion measures.\nFinally, as an application of ZADU, we present another library called ZADUVis\nthat allows users to easily create distortion visualizations that depict the\nextent to which each region of an embedding suffers from distortions.",

      "abstract": "The absorption signals of metastable He in HD 209458b and several other\nexoplanets can be explained via escaping atmosphere model with a subsolar He/H\nratio. The low abundance of helium can be a result of planet formation if there\nis a small amount of helium in their primordial atmosphere. However, another\npossibility is that the low He/H ratio is caused by the process of mass\nfractionation of helium in the atmosphere. In order to investigate the effect\nof the fractionation in the hydrogen-helium atmosphere, we developed a\nself-consistent multi-fluid 1D hydrodynamic model based on the well-known\nopen-source MHD code PLUTO. Our simulations show that a lower He/H ratio can be\nproduced spontaneously in the multi-fluid model. We further modeled the\ntransmission spectra of He 10830 lines for HD 209458b in a broad parameter\nspace. The transmission spectrum of the observation can be fitted in the\ncondition of 1.80 times the X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet flux of the quiet\nSun. Meanwhile, the ratio of the escaping flux of helium to hydrogen,\n$F_{He}/F_{H}$, is 0.039. Our results indicate that the mass fractionation of\nhelium to hydrogen can naturally interpret the low He/H ratio required by the\nobservation. Thus, in the escaping atmosphere of HD 209458b, decreasing the\nabundance of helium in the atmosphere is not needed even if its He abundance is\nsimilar to that of the Sun. The simulation presented in this work hints that in\nthe escaping atmosphere, mass fractionation can also occur on other exoplanets,\nwhich needs to be explored further.",

      "title": "CLAMS: A Cluster Ambiguity Measure for Estimating Perceptual Variability\n  in Visual Clustering",
      "abstract": "Visual clustering is a common perceptual task in scatterplots that supports\ndiverse analytics tasks (e.g., cluster identification). However, even with the\nsame scatterplot, the ways of perceiving clusters (i.e., conducting visual\nclustering) can differ due to the differences among individuals and ambiguous\ncluster boundaries. Although such perceptual variability casts doubt on the\nreliability of data analysis based on visual clustering, we lack a systematic\nway to efficiently assess this variability. In this research, we study\nperceptual variability in conducting visual clustering, which we call Cluster\nAmbiguity. To this end, we introduce CLAMS, a data-driven visual quality\nmeasure for automatically predicting cluster ambiguity in monochrome\nscatterplots. We first conduct a qualitative study to identify key factors that\naffect the visual separation of clusters (e.g., proximity or size difference\nbetween clusters). Based on study findings, we deploy a regression module that\nestimates the human-judged separability of two clusters. Then, CLAMS predicts\ncluster ambiguity by analyzing the aggregated results of all pairwise\nseparability between clusters that are generated by the module. CLAMS\noutperforms widely-used clustering techniques in predicting ground truth\ncluster ambiguity. Meanwhile, CLAMS exhibits performance on par with human\nannotators. We conclude our work by presenting two applications for optimizing\nand benchmarking data mining techniques using CLAMS. The interactive demo of\nCLAMS is available at clusterambiguity.dev.",

      "abstract": "Model selection is an integral problem of model based optimization techniques\nsuch as Bayesian optimization (BO). Current approaches often treat model\nselection as an estimation problem, to be periodically updated with\nobservations coming from the optimization iterations. In this paper, we propose\nan alternative way to achieve both efficiently. Specifically, we propose a\nnovel way of integrating model selection and BO for the single goal of reaching\nthe function optima faster. The algorithm moves back and forth between BO in\nthe model space and BO in the function space, where the goodness of the\nrecommended model is captured by a score function and fed back, capturing how\nwell the model helped convergence in the function space. The score function is\nderived in such a way that it neutralizes the effect of the moving nature of\nthe BO in the function space, thus keeping the model selection problem\nstationary. This back and forth leads to quick convergence for both model\nselection and BO in the function space. In addition to improved sample\nefficiency, the framework outputs information about the black-box function.\nConvergence is proved, and experimental results show significant improvement\ncompared to standard BO.",

Since collecting OCT images is relatively more\nexpensive than fundus photographs, existing methods use multi-modal learning to\ncomplement limited OCT data with additional context from fundus images.\nHowever, the multi-modal framework requires eye-paired datasets of both\nmodalities, which is impractical for clinical use. To address this problem, we\npropose a novel fundus-enhanced disease-aware distillation model (FDDM), for\nretinal disease classification from OCT images.

      "abstract": "Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques typically rely on a given\ntest-suite to guide the repair process. Apart from the need to provide test\noracles, this makes the produced patches prone to test data over-fitting. In\nthis work, instead of relying on test cases, we show how to automatically\nrepair memory safety issues, by leveraging static analysis (specifically\nIncorrectness Separation Logic) to guide repair. Our proposed approach learns\nwhat a desirable patch is by inspecting how close a patch is to fixing the bug\nbased on the feedback from incorrectness separation logic based static analysis\n(specifically the Pulse analyser), and turning this information into a\ndistribution of probabilities over context free grammars. Furthermore, instead\nof focusing on heuristics for reducing the search space of patches, we make\nrepair scalable by creating classes of equivalent patches according to the\neffect they have on the symbolic heap, and then invoking the validation oracle\nonly once per class of patch equivalence. This allows us to efficiently\ndiscover repairs even in the presence of a large pool of patch candidates\noffered by our generic patch synthesis mechanism. Experimental evaluation of\nour approach was conducted by repairing real world memory errors in OpenSSL,\nswoole and other subjects. The evaluation results show the scalability and\nefficacy of our approach in automatically producing high quality patches.",

      "abstract": "Text-based VQA aims at answering questions by reading the text present in the\nimages. It requires a large amount of scene-text relationship understanding\ncompared to the VQA task. Recent studies have shown that the question-answer\npairs in the dataset are more focused on the text present in the image but less\nimportance is given to visual features and some questions do not require\nunderstanding the image. The models trained on this dataset predict biased\nanswers due to the lack of understanding of visual context.

To address\nthese issues, we propose a method to learn visual features (making V matter in\nTextVQA) along with the OCR features and question features using VQA dataset as\nexternal knowledge for Text-based VQA. Specifically, we combine the TextVQA\ndataset and VQA dataset and train the model on this combined dataset.

      "abstract": "Foraging is crucial for animals to survive. Many species forage in groups, as\nindividuals communicate to share information about the location of available\nresources. For example, eusocial foragers, such as honey bees and many ants,\nrecruit members from their central hive or nest to a known foraging site.\nHowever, the optimal level of communication and recruitment depends on the\noverall group size, the distribution of available resources, and the extent of\ninterference between multiple individuals attempting to forage from a site. In\nthis paper, we develop a discrete-time Markov chain model of eusocial foragers,\nwho communicate information with a certain probability. We compare the\nstochastic model and its corresponding infinite-population limit. We find that\nforaging efficiency tapers off when recruitment probability is too high -- a\nphenomenon that does not occur in the infinite-population model, even though it\noccurs for any finite population size. The marginal inefficiency at high\nrecruitment probability increases as the population increases, similar to a\nboundary layer. In particular, we prove there is a significant gap between the\nforaging efficiency of finite and infinite population models in the extreme\ncase of complete communication. We also analyze this phenomenon by\napproximating the stationary distribution of foragers over sites in terms of\nmean escape times from multiple quasi-steady states. We conclude that for any\nfinite group of foragers, an individual who has found a resource should only\nsometimes recruit others to the same resource. We discuss the relationship\nbetween our analysis and multi-agent multi-arm bandit problems.",

      "abstract": "Online continual learning (CL) studies the problem of learning continuously\nfrom a single-pass data stream while adapting to new data and mitigating\ncatastrophic forgetting. Recently, by storing a small subset of old data,\nreplay-based methods have shown promising performance. Unlike previous methods\nthat focus on sample storage or knowledge distillation against catastrophic\nforgetting, this paper aims to understand why the online learning models fail\nto generalize well from a new perspective of shortcut learning. We identify\nshortcut learning as the key limiting factor for online CL, where the learned\nfeatures may be biased, not generalizable to new tasks, and may have an adverse\nimpact on knowledge distillation. To tackle this issue, we present the online\nprototype learning (OnPro) framework for online CL. First, we propose online\nprototype equilibrium to learn representative features against shortcut\nlearning and discriminative features to avoid class confusion, ultimately\nachieving an equilibrium status that separates all seen classes well while\nlearning new classes. Second, with the feedback of online prototypes, we devise\na novel adaptive prototypical feedback mechanism to sense the classes that are\neasily misclassified and then enhance their boundaries. Extensive experimental\nresults on widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance\nof OnPro over the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

      "abstract": "Camouflaged object detection is a challenging task that aims to identify\nobjects that are highly similar to their background. Due to the powerful\nnoise-to-image denoising capability of denoising diffusion models, in this\npaper, we propose a diffusion-based framework for camouflaged object detection,\ntermed diffCOD, a new framework that considers the camouflaged object\nsegmentation task as a denoising diffusion process from noisy masks to object\nmasks. Specifically, the object mask diffuses from the ground-truth masks to a\nrandom distribution, and the designed model learns to reverse this noising\nprocess. To strengthen the denoising learning, the input image prior is encoded\nand integrated into the denoising diffusion model to guide the diffusion\nprocess. Furthermore, we design an injection attention module (IAM) to interact\nconditional semantic features extracted from the image with the diffusion noise\nembedding via the cross-attention mechanism to enhance denoising learning.\nExtensive experiments on four widely used COD benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat the proposed method achieves favorable performance compared to the\nexisting 11 state-of-the-art methods, especially in the detailed texture\nsegmentation of camouflaged objects.

      "abstract": "Compact elliptical (cE) galaxies remain an elusively difficult galaxy class\nto study. Recent observations have suggested that isolated and host-associated\ncEs have different formation pathways, while simulation studies have also shown\ndifferent pathways can lead to a cE galaxy. However a solid link has not been\nestablished, and the relative contributions of each pathway in a cosmological\ncontext remains unknown. Here we combine a spatially-resolved observational\nsample of cEs taken from the SAMI galaxy survey with a matched sample of\ngalaxies within the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to establish an\noverall picture of how these galaxies form. The observed cEs located near a\nhost galaxy appear redder, smaller and older than isolated cEs, supporting\nprevious evidence for multiple formation pathways. Tracing the simulated cEs\nback through time, we find two main formation pathways; 32 $\\pm$ 5 percent\nformed via the stripping of a spiral galaxy by a larger host galaxy, while 68\n$\\pm$ 4 percent formed through a gradual build-up of stellar mass in isolated\nenvironments. We confirm that cEs in different environments do indeed form via\ndifferent pathways, with all isolated cEs in our sample having formed via\nin-situ formation (i.e. none were ejected from a previous host), and 77 $\\pm$ 6\npercent of host-associated cEs having formed via tidal stripping. Separating\nthem by their formation pathway, we are able to reproduce the observed\ndifferences between isolated and host-associated cEs, showing that these\ndifferences can be fully explained by the different formation pathways\ndominating in each environment.",

In practice it usually converges quickly to solutions\nwithin a few percentages of optimality. In contrast to this, its running-time\nis exponential and its approximation performance is poor in the worst case.\n  Englert, R\\\"oglin, and V\\\"ocking (Algorithmica, 2014) provided a smoothed\nanalysis in the so-called one-step model in order to explain the performance of\n2-opt on d-dimensional Euclidean instances, both in terms of running-time and\nin terms of approximation ratio. However, translating their results to the\nclassical model of smoothed analysis, where points are perturbed by Gaussian\ndistributions with standard deviation sigma, yields only weak bounds.\n  We prove bounds that are polynomial in n and 1/sigma for the smoothed\nrunning-time with Gaussian perturbations. In addition, our analysis for\nEuclidean distances is much simpler than the existing smoothed analysis.\n  Furthermore, we prove a smoothed approximation ratio of O(log(1/sigma)). This\nbound is almost tight, as we also provide a lower bound of Omega(log n/ loglog\nn) for sigma = O(1/sqrt n). Our main technical novelty here is that, different\nfrom existing smoothed analyses, we do not separately analyze objective values\nof the global and local optimum on all inputs (which only allows for a bound of\nO(1/sigma)), but simultaneously bound them on the same input.",

As answer of this\nquestion, in this paper, we show the method applied on denoising problem and\ndomain adaptation using human feedback. Deep generative models have\ndemonstrated impressive results in image denoising. However, current image\ndenoising models often produce inappropriate results when applied to domains\ndifferent from the ones they were trained on. If there are `Good' and `Bad'\nresult for unseen data, how to raise up quality of `Bad' result. Most methods\nuse an approach based on generalization of model. However, these methods\nrequire target image for training or adapting unseen domain. In this paper, to\nadapting domain, we deal with non-target image for unseen domain, and improve\nspecific failed image. To address this, we propose a method for fine-tuning\ninappropriate results generated in a different domain by utilizing human\nfeedback. First, we train a generator to denoise images using only the noisy\nMNIST digit '0' images. The denoising generator trained on the source domain\nleads to unintended results when applied to target domain images. To achieve\ndomain adaptation, we construct a noise-image denoising generated image data\nset and train a reward model predict human feedback. Finally, we fine-tune the\ngenerator on the different domain using the reward model with auxiliary loss\nfunction, aiming to transfer denoising capabilities to target domain. Our\napproach demonstrates the potential to efficiently fine-tune a generator\ntrained on one domain using human feedback from another domain, thereby\nenhancing denoising abilities in different domains.",

However,\nexisting OOD detection approaches primarily rely on the feature maps or the\nfull gradient space information to derive OOD scores neglecting the role of\nmost important parameters of the pre-trained network over in-distribution (ID)\ndata. In this study, we propose a novel approach called GradOrth to facilitate\nOOD detection based on one intriguing observation that the important features\nto identify OOD data lie in the lower-rank subspace of in-distribution (ID)\ndata. In particular, we identify OOD data by computing the norm of gradient\nprojection on the subspaces considered important for the in-distribution data.\nA large orthogonal projection value (i.e. a small projection value) indicates\nthe sample as OOD as it captures a weak correlation of the ID data.

Moreover, recent research has shown that adversarial\ntraining suffers from a severe non-uniform robust performance across the\ntraining distribution, e.g., data points belonging to some classes can be much\nmore vulnerable to adversarial attacks than others. To address both issues, in\nthis paper, we propose a novel doubly-robust instance reweighted AT framework,\nwhich allows to obtain the importance weights via exploring distributionally\nrobust optimization (DRO) techniques, and at the same time boosts the\nrobustness on the most vulnerable examples. In particular, our importance\nweights are obtained by optimizing the KL-divergence regularized loss function,\nwhich allows us to devise new algorithms with a theoretical convergence\nguarantee. Experiments on standard classification datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed approach outperforms related state-of-the-art baseline methods in\nterms of average robust performance, and at the same time improves the\nrobustness against attacks on the weakest data points.

      "abstract": "Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes by generalizing the\nknowledge, i.e., visual and semantic relationships, obtained from seen classes,\nwhere image augmentation techniques are commonly applied to improve the\ngeneralization ability of a model. However, this approach can also cause\nadverse effects on ZSL since the conventional augmentation techniques that\nsolely depend on single-label supervision is not able to maintain semantic\ninformation and result in the semantic distortion issue consequently. In other\nwords, image argumentation may falsify the semantic (e.g., attribute)\ninformation of an image. To take the advantage of image augmentations while\nmitigating the semantic distortion issue, we propose a novel ZSL approach by\nHarnessing Adversarial Samples (HAS). HAS advances ZSL through adversarial\ntraining which takes into account three crucial aspects: (1) robust generation\nby enforcing augmentations to be similar to negative classes, while maintaining\ncorrect labels, (2) reliable generation by introducing a latent space\nconstraint to avert significant deviations from the original data manifold, and\n(3) diverse generation by incorporating attribute-based perturbation by\nadjusting images according to each semantic attribute's localization. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on three prominent zero-shot benchmark datasets, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our adversarial samples approach in both ZSL\nand Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) scenarios.

      "abstract": "Human body-pose estimation is a complex problem in computer vision. Recent\nresearch interests have been widened specifically on the Sports, Yoga, and\nDance (SYD) postures for maintaining health conditions. The SYD pose categories\nare regarded as a fine-grained image classification task due to the complex\nmovement of body parts. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have attained\nsignificantly improved performance in solving various human body-pose\nestimation problems. Though decent progress has been achieved in yoga postures\nrecognition using deep learning techniques, fine-grained sports, and dance\nrecognition necessitates ample research attention. However, no benchmark public\nimage dataset with sufficient inter-class and intra-class variations is\navailable yet to address sports and dance postures classification. To solve\nthis limitation, we have proposed two image datasets, one for 102 sport\ncategories and another for 12 dance styles. Two public datasets, Yoga-82 which\ncontains 82 classes and Yoga-107 represents 107 classes are collected for yoga\npostures. These four SYD datasets are experimented with the proposed deep\nmodel, SYD-Net, which integrates a patch-based attention (PbA) mechanism on top\nof standard backbone CNNs. The PbA module leverages the self-attention\nmechanism that learns contextual information from a set of uniform and\nmulti-scale patches and emphasizes discriminative features to understand the\nsemantic correlation among patches. Moreover, random erasing data augmentation\nis applied to improve performance. The proposed SYD-Net has achieved\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on Yoga-82 using five base CNNs. SYD-Net's accuracy\non other datasets is remarkable, implying its efficiency. Our Sports-102 and\nDance-12 datasets are publicly available at\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/syd-net/home.",

Existing\napproaches employ robotic systems to detect the occupancy status of individual\nparking spaces and primarily focus on enhancing detection accuracy through\nperception pipelines.

In light of these limitations, we introduce the problem of\ninformative path planning for parking occupancy estimation using autonomous\nvehicles and formulate it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process\n(POMDP) task.

      "abstract": "Finding a high-quality feasible solution to a combinatorial optimization (CO)\nproblem in a limited time is challenging due to its discrete nature. Recently,\nthere has been an increasing number of machine learning (ML) methods for\naddressing CO problems. Neural diving (ND) is one of the learning-based\napproaches to generating partial discrete variable assignments in Mixed Integer\nPrograms (MIP), a framework for modeling CO problems. However, a major drawback\nof ND is a large discrepancy between the ML and MIP objectives, i.e., variable\nvalue classification accuracy over primal bound. Our study investigates that a\nspecific range of variable assignment rates (coverage) yields high-quality\nfeasible solutions, where we suggest optimizing the coverage bridges the gap\nbetween the learning and MIP objectives. Consequently, we introduce a post-hoc\nmethod and a learning-based approach for optimizing the coverage. A key idea of\nour approach is to jointly learn to restrict the coverage search space and to\npredict the coverage in the learned search space. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that learning a deep neural network to estimate the coverage for\nfinding high-quality feasible solutions achieves state-of-the-art performance\nin NeurIPS ML4CO datasets. In particular, our method shows outstanding\nperformance in the workload apportionment dataset, achieving the optimality gap\nof 0.45%, a ten-fold improvement over SCIP within the one-minute time limit.",

      "abstract": "When subhalos infall into galaxy clusters, their gas content is ram pressure\nstripped by the intracluster medium (ICM) and may turn into cometary tails. We\nreport the discovery of two spectacular X-ray double tails in a single galaxy\ncluster, Z8338, revealed by 70 ks Chandra observations. The brighter one, with\nan X-ray bolometric luminosity of $3.9 \\times 10^{42}{\\rm\\ erg\\ s}^{-1}$, is a\ndetached tail stripped from the host halo and extended at least 250 kpc in\nprojection. The head of the detached tail is a cool core with the front tip of\nthe cold front $\\sim$ 30 kpc away from the nucleus of its former host galaxy.\nThe cooling time of the detached cool core is $\\sim 0.3$ Gyr. For the detached\ngas, the gravity of the once-associated dark matter halo further enhances the\nRayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability. From its survival, we find that a magnetic\nfield of a few $\\mu$G is required to suppress the hydrodynamic instability. The\nX-ray temperature in the tail increases from 0.9 keV at the front tip to 1.6\nkeV in the wake region, which suggests the turbulent mixing with the hotter\nICM. The fainter double X-ray tail, with a total X-ray luminosity of $2.7\n\\times 10^{42}{\\rm\\ erg\\ s}^{-1}$, appears to stem from the cool core of a\nsubcluster in Z8338, and likely was formed during the ongoing merger. This\nexample suggests that X-ray cool cores can be displaced and eventually\ndestroyed by mergers, while the displaced cool cores can survive for some\nextended period of time.",

      "abstract": "The harmonic balance method is the most commonly used method for solving\nperiodic solutions of nonlinear dynamic systems, but the high-order\napproximation of nonlinear terms requires sophisticated formula derivation,\nwhich limits its ultra-high accuracy. The authors' team proposed the\nreconstruction harmonic balance (RHB) method through the equivalent\nreconstruction of the frequency domain nonlinear quantity in the time domain,\nwhich settled the problem of ultra-high-order calculation of the classical\nharmonic balance method. However, both methods require the dynamical system to\nbe polynomial nonlinear, and cannot be directly used to solve the\nquasi-periodic solution of the nonlinear system. In view of the above problems,\nthis paper proposes a computational method that combines the RHB method and the\nrecast technique for complex nonlinear systems. First, the general nonlinear\nproblem is non-destructively recast into a polynomial nonlinear system, and\nthen the RHB method is used for high-precision solutions. Aiming at computing\nthe quasi-periodic response, the RHB method based on the idea of \"supplemental\nfrequency\" is derived. By optimizing and selecting base frequencies, the fast\nand accurate capture of quasi-periodic response is achieved. The typical\nsystems such as nonlinear pendulum, relativistic harmonic oscillator, and\nnonlinear coupling asymmetric pendulum are selected for simulation. The\nsimulation results show that the accuracy of the RHB-recast method for solving\nnonpolynomial nonlinear systems is on the order of 10^(-12), reaching the\ncomputer accuracy, far exceeding state-of-the-art methods. The supplemental\nfrequency RHB method achieves the efficient solution of quasi-periodic\nproblems.",

      "abstract": "We study the spatial isosceles three-body problem from the perspective of\nSymplectic Dynamics. For certain choices of mass ratio, angular momentum, and\nenergy, the dynamics on the energy surface is equivalent to a Reeb flow on the\ntight three-sphere. We find a Hopf link formed by the Euler orbit and a\nsymmetric brake orbit, which spans an open book decomposition whose pages are\nannulus-like global surfaces of section. In the case of large mass ratios, the\nHopf link is non-resonant, forcing the existence of infinitely many periodic\norbits. The rotation number of the Euler orbit plays a fundamental role in the\nexistence of periodic orbits and their symmetries. We explore such symmetries\nin the Hill region and show that the Euler orbit is negative hyperbolic for an\nopen set of parameters while it can never be positive hyperbolic. Finally, we\naddress convexity and determine for each parameter whether the energy surface\nis strictly convex, convex, or non-convex. Dynamical consequences of this fact\nare then discussed.",

      "abstract": "As AI and machine-learned software are used increasingly for making decisions\nthat affect humans, it is imperative that they remain fair and unbiased in\ntheir decisions. To complement design-time bias mitigation measures, runtime\nverification techniques have been introduced recently to monitor the\nalgorithmic fairness of deployed systems. Previous monitoring techniques assume\nfull observability of the states of the (unknown) monitored system. Moreover,\nthey can monitor only fairness properties that are specified as arithmetic\nexpressions over the probabilities of different events. In this work, we extend\nfairness monitoring to systems modeled as partially observed Markov chains\n(POMC), and to specifications containing arithmetic expressions over the\nexpected values of numerical functions on event sequences. The only assumptions\nwe make are that the underlying POMC is aperiodic and starts in the stationary\ndistribution, with a bound on its mixing time being known. These assumptions\nenable us to estimate a given property for the entire distribution of possible\nexecutions of the monitored POMC, by observing only a single execution. Our\nmonitors observe a long run of the system and, after each new observation,\noutput updated PAC-estimates of how fair or biased the system is. The monitors\nare computationally lightweight and, using a prototype implementation, we\ndemonstrate their effectiveness on several real-world examples.",

      "abstract": "Open-world instance-level scene understanding aims to locate and recognize\nunseen object categories that are not present in the annotated dataset. This\ntask is challenging because the model needs to both localize novel 3D objects\nand infer their semantic categories. A key factor for the recent progress in 2D\nopen-world perception is the availability of large-scale image-text pairs from\nthe Internet, which cover a wide range of vocabulary concepts. However, this\nsuccess is hard to replicate in 3D scenarios due to the scarcity of 3D-text\npairs. To address this challenge, we propose to harness pre-trained\nvision-language (VL) foundation models that encode extensive knowledge from\nimage-text pairs to generate captions for multi-view images of 3D scenes. This\nallows us to establish explicit associations between 3D shapes and\nsemantic-rich captions. Moreover, to enhance the fine-grained visual-semantic\nrepresentation learning from captions for object-level categorization, we\ndesign hierarchical point-caption association methods to learn semantic-aware\nembeddings that exploit the 3D geometry between 3D points and multi-view\nimages. In addition, to tackle the localization challenge for novel classes in\nthe open-world setting, we develop debiased instance localization, which\ninvolves training object grouping modules on unlabeled data using\ninstance-level pseudo supervision. This significantly improves the\ngeneralization capabilities of instance grouping and thus the ability to\naccurately locate novel objects. We conduct extensive experiments on 3D\nsemantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks, covering indoor and\noutdoor scenes across three datasets. Our method outperforms baseline methods\nby a significant margin in semantic segmentation (e.g. 34.5%$\\sim$65.3%),\ninstance segmentation (e.g. 21.8%$\\sim$54.0%) and panoptic segmentation (e.g.\n14.7%$\\sim$43.3%).

      "abstract": "Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is an unsupervised learning technique that\npreserves pairwise distances between observations and is commonly used for\nanalyzing multivariate biological datasets. Recent advances in MDS have\nachieved successful classification results, but the configurations heavily\ndepend on the choice of hyperparameters, limiting its broader application.\nHere, we present a self-supervised MDS approach informed by the dispersions of\nobservations that share a common binary label ($F$-ratio). Our visualization\naccurately configures the $F$-ratio while consistently preserving the global\nstructure with a low data distortion compared to existing dimensionality\nreduction tools.

      "abstract": "Orbital-free Density Functional Theory (OF-DFT) has been used when studying\natoms, molecules and solids. In nuclear physics, there has been basically no\napplication of OF-DFT so far, as the Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been\nwidely applied to the study of many nuclear properties mostly within the\nKohn-Sham (KS) scheme. There are many realizations of nuclear KS-DFT, but\ncomputations become very demanding for heavy systems, such as superheavy nuclei\nand the inner crust of neutron stars, and it is hard to describe exotic nuclear\nshapes using a finite basis made with a limited number of orbitals. These\nbottlenecks could, in principle, be overcome by an orbital-free formulation of\nDFT. This work is a first step towards the application of OF-DFT to nuclei. In\nparticular, we have implemented possible choices for an orbital-free kinetic\nenergy and solved the associated Schr\\\"odinger equation either with simple\npotentials or with simplified nuclear density functionals. While the former\nchoice sheds light on the differences between electronic and nuclear systems,\nthe latter choice allows us discussing the practical applications to nuclei and\nthe open questions.",

      "abstract": "Deviations from the approved design or processes during mass production can\nlead to unforeseen risks. However, these changes are sometimes necessary due to\nchanges in the product design characteristics or an adaptation in the\nmanufacturing process. A major challenge is to identify these risks early in\nthe workflow so that failures leading to warranty claims can be avoided. We\ndeveloped Fountain as a contextual assistant integrated in the deviation\nmanagement workflow that helps in identifying the risks based on the\ndescription of the existing design and process criteria and the proposed\ndeviation. In the manufacturing context, it is important that the assistant\nprovides recommendations that are explainable and consistent. We achieve this\nthrough a combination of the following two components 1) language models\nfinetuned for domain specific semantic similarity and, 2) knowledge\nrepresentation in the form of a property graph derived from the bill of\nmaterials, Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and prior failures reported\nby customers. Here, we present the nuances of selecting and adapting pretrained\nlanguage models for an engineering domain, continuous model updates based on\nuser interaction with the contextual assistant and creating the causal chain\nfor explainable recommendations based on the knowledge representation.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that the model adaptation is feasible using\nmoderate computational infrastructure already available to most engineering\nteams in manufacturing organizations and inference can be performed on standard\nCPU only instances for integration with existing applications making these\nmethods easily deployable.",

Based on the quasi-geostrophic dynamics of an idealized patch of\nocean hosting an arbitrary vertically sheared zonal flow, we provide a\nquantitative prediction for the vertical structure of the buoyancy flux without\nadjustable parameters. The prediction agrees quantitatively with meridional\nflux profiles obtained through numerical simulations of an idealized patch of\nocean with realistic parameter values.

The\nstandard method for generating dynamical models with a finite extent consists\nof taking a model with an infinite extent and applying a truncation in binding\nenergy. This method, however, cannot be used to generate models with a pre-set\nanalytical mass density profile. We investigate the self-consistency and\ndynamical properties of a family of power-law spheres with a general tangential\nCuddeford (TC) orbital structure. By varying the density power-law slope\n$\\gamma$ and the central anisotropy $\\beta_0$, these models cover a wide\nparameter space in density and anisotropy profiles. We explicitly calculate the\nphase-space distribution function for various parameter combinations, and\ninterpret our results in terms of the energy distribution of bound orbits. We\nfind that truncated power-law spheres can be supported by a TC orbital\nstructure if and only if $\\gamma \\geqslant 2\\beta_0$, which means that the\ncentral density slope-anisotropy inequality is both a sufficient and a\nnecessary condition for this family. We provide closed expressions for\nstructural and dynamical properties such as the radial and tangential velocity\ndispersion profiles, which can be compared against more complex numerical\nmodelling results.

      "abstract": "We are interested in numerically solving a transitional model derived from\nthe Bloch model. The Bloch equation describes the time evolution of the density\nmatrix of a quantum system forced by an electromagnetic wave. In a high\nfrequency and low amplitude regime, it asymptotically reduces to a non-stiff\nrate equation. As a middle ground, the transitional model governs the diagonal\npart of the density matrix. It fits in a general setting of linear problems\nwith a high-frequency quasi-periodic forcing and an exponentially decaying\nforcing. The numerical resolution of such problems is challenging. Adapting\nhigh-order averaging techniques to this setting, we separate the slow (rate)\ndynamics from the fast (oscillatory and decay) dynamics to derive a new\nmicro-macro problem. We derive estimates for the size of the micro part of the\ndecomposition, and of its time derivatives, showing that this new problem is\nnon-stiff. As such, we may solve this micro-macro problem with uniform accuracy\nusing standard numerical schemes. To validate this approach, we present\nnumerical results first on a toy problem and then on the transitional Bloch\nmodel.",

We refer to this new fingerprint as \"micro-CSI\". Our\nexperiments show that micro-CSI is likely to be caused by imperfections in the\nradio-frequency circuitry and is present in Wi-Fi 4/5/6 network interface cards\n(NICs).

      "abstract": "Shape completion, i.e., predicting the complete geometry of an object from a\npartial observation, is highly relevant for several downstream tasks, most\nnotably robotic manipulation. When basing planning or prediction of real grasps\non object shape reconstruction, an indication of severe geometric uncertainty\nis indispensable. In particular, there can be an irreducible uncertainty in\nextended regions about the presence of entire object parts when given ambiguous\nobject views. To treat this important case, we propose two novel methods for\npredicting such uncertain regions as straightforward extensions of any method\nfor predicting local spatial occupancy, one through postprocessing occupancy\nscores, the other through direct prediction of an uncertainty indicator. We\ncompare these methods together with two known approaches to probabilistic shape\ncompletion. Moreover, we generate a dataset, derived from ShapeNet, of\nrealistically rendered depth images of object views with ground-truth\nannotations for the uncertain regions. We train on this dataset and test each\nmethod in shape completion and prediction of uncertain regions for known and\nnovel object instances and on synthetic and real data. While direct uncertainty\nprediction is by far the most accurate in the segmentation of uncertain\nregions, both novel methods outperform the two baselines in shape completion\nand uncertain region prediction, and avoiding the predicted uncertain regions\nincreases the quality of grasps for all tested methods.

      "abstract": "Dual active bridge (DAB) converter is the key enabler in many popular\napplications such as wireless charging, electric vehicle and renewable energy.\nZVS range and efficiency are two significant performance indicators for DAB\nconverter. To obtain the desired ZVS and efficiency performance, modulation\nshould be carefully designed. Hybrid modulation considers several single\nmodulation strategies to achieve good comprehensive performance.\nConventionally, to design a hybrid modulation, harmonic approach or piecewise\napproach is used, but they suffer from time-consuming model building process\nand inaccuracy. Therefore, an artificial-intelligence-based hybrid extended\nphase shift (HEPS) modulation is proposed. Generally, the HEPS modulation is\ndeveloped in an automated fashion, which alleviates cumbersome model building\nprocess while keeping high model accuracy. In HEPS modulation, two EPS\nstrategies are considered to realize optimal efficiency with full ZVS operation\nover entire operating ranges. Specifically, to build data-driven models of ZVS\nand efficiency performance, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), which is a\nstate-of-the-art ensemble learning algorithm, is adopted. Afterwards, particle\nswarm optimization with state-based adaptive velocity limit (PSO-SAVL) is\nutilized to select the best EPS strategy and optimize modulation parameters.\nWith 1 kW hardware experiments, the feasibility of HEPS has been verified,\nachieving optimal efficiency with maximum of 97.1% and full-range ZVS\noperation.",

      "abstract": "The dual active bridge (DAB) converter has been popular in many applications\nfor its outstanding power density and bidirectional power transfer capacity. Up\nto now, triple phase shift (TPS) can be considered as one of the most advanced\nmodulation techniques for DAB converter. It can widen zero voltage switching\nrange and improve power efficiency significantly. Currently, current stress of\nthe DAB converter has been an important performance indicator when TPS\nmodulation is applied for smaller size and higher efficiency. However, to\nminimize the current stress when the DAB converter is under TPS modulation, two\ndifficulties exist in analysis process and realization process, respectively.\nFirstly, three degrees of modulation variables in TPS modulation bring\nchallenges to the analysis of current stress in different operating modes. This\nanalysis and deduction process leads to heavy computational burden and also\nsuffers from low accuracy. Secondly, to realize TPS modulation, if a lookup\ntable is adopted after the optimization of modulation variables, modulation\nperformance will be unsatisfactory because of the discrete nature of lookup\ntable. Therefore, an AI-based TPS modulation (AI-TPSM) strategy is proposed in\nthis paper. Neural network (NN) and fuzzy inference system (FIS) are utilized\nto deal with the two difficulties mentioned above. With the proposed AI-TPSM,\nthe optimization of TPS modulation for minimized current stress will enjoy high\ndegree of automation which can relieve engineers' working burden and improve\naccuracy. In the end of this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed AI-TPSM\nhas been experimentally verified with a 1 kW prototype.",

      "abstract": "Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to predict judgment outcomes based on\ncase description. Several researchers have developed techniques to assist\npotential clients by predicting the outcome in the legal profession. However,\nnone of the proposed techniques were implemented in Arabic, and only a few\nattempts were implemented in English, Chinese, and Hindi. In this paper, we\ndevelop a system that utilizes deep learning (DL) and natural language\nprocessing (NLP) techniques to predict the judgment outcome from Arabic case\nscripts, especially in cases of custody and annulment of marriage. This system\nwill assist judges and attorneys in improving their work and time efficiency\nwhile reducing sentencing disparity. In addition, it will help litigants,\nlawyers, and law students analyze the probable outcomes of any given case\nbefore trial. We use a different machine and deep learning models such as\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic regression (LR), Long Short Term Memory\n(LSTM), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) using representation\ntechniques such as TF-IDF and word2vec on the developed dataset. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that compared with the five baseline methods, the SVM model\nwith word2vec and LR with TF-IDF achieve the highest accuracy of 88% and 78% in\npredicting the judgment on custody cases and annulment of marriage,\nrespectively. Furthermore, the LR and SVM with word2vec and BiLSTM model with\nTF-IDF achieved the highest accuracy of 88% and 69% in predicting the\nprobability of outcomes on custody cases and annulment of marriage,\nrespectively.",

      "abstract": "White dwarf studies carry significant implications across multiple fields of\nastrophysics, including exoplanets, supernova explosions, and cosmological\ninvestigations. Thus, accurate determinations of their fundamental parameters\n(Teff and log g) are of utmost importance. While optical surveys have provided\nmeasurements for many white dwarfs, there is a lack of studies utilising\nultraviolet (UV) data, particularly focusing on the warmer ones that\npredominantly emit in the UV range. Here, we present the medium-resolution\nfar-UV spectroscopic survey of 311 DA white dwarfs obtained with Cosmic Origins\nSpectrograph (COS) onboard Hubble Space Telescope confirming 49 photometric\nGaia candidates. We used 3D extinction maps, parallaxes, and hydrogen\natmosphere models to fit the spectra of the stars that lie in the range 12 000\n< Teff < 33 000 K, and 7 <= log g < 9.2. To assess the impact of input physics,\nwe employed two mass-radius relations in the fitting and compared the results\nwith previous studies. The comparisons suggest the COS Teff are systematically\nlower by 3 per cent on average than Balmer line fits while they differ by only\n1.5 per cent from optical photometric studies. The mass distributions indicate\nthat the COS masses are smaller by approximately 0.05 Msol and 0.02 Msol than\nBalmer lines and photometric masses, respectively. Performing several tests, we\nfind that the discrepancies are either arising due to issues with the COS\ncalibration, broadening theories for hydrogen lines, or interstellar reddening\nwhich needs further examination. Based on comparative analysis, we identify 30\nbinary candidates drawing attention for follow-up studies to confirm their\nnature.",

      "abstract": "Automatic fact-checking plays a crucial role in combating the spread of\nmisinformation. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Instruction-Following\nvariants, such as InstructGPT and Alpaca, have shown remarkable performance in\nvarious natural language processing tasks. However, their knowledge may not\nalways be up-to-date or sufficient, potentially leading to inaccuracies in\nfact-checking. To address this limitation, we propose combining the power of\ninstruction-following language models with external evidence retrieval to\nenhance fact-checking performance. Our approach involves leveraging search\nengines to retrieve relevant evidence for a given input claim. This external\nevidence serves as valuable supplementary information to augment the knowledge\nof the pretrained language model. Then, we instruct-tune an open-sourced\nlanguage model, called LLaMA, using this evidence, enabling it to predict the\nveracity of the input claim more accurately. To evaluate our method, we\nconducted experiments on two widely used fact-checking datasets: RAWFC and\nLIAR. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in fact-checking tasks. By integrating external evidence, we bridge\nthe gap between the model's knowledge and the most up-to-date and sufficient\ncontext available, leading to improved fact-checking outcomes. Our findings\nhave implications for combating misinformation and promoting the dissemination\nof accurate information on online platforms.

Breaking dynamic programs into a set of sparse dynamic programs\nthat can be divided, solved, and merged in sublinear time.\n  The rectangle escape problem (REP) is defined as follows: For $n$\naxis-aligned rectangles inside an axis-aligned bounding box $B$, extend each\nrectangle in only one of the four directions: up, down, left, or right until it\nreaches $B$ and the density $k$ is minimized, where $k$ is the maximum number\nof extensions of rectangles to the boundary that pass through a point inside\nbounding box $B$. REP is NP-hard for $k>1$. If the rectangles are points of a\ngrid (or unit squares of a grid), the problem is called the square escape\nproblem (SEP) and it is still NP-hard.\n  We give a $2$-approximation algorithm for SEP with $k\\geq2$ with time\ncomplexity $O(n^{3/2}k^2)$. This improves the time complexity of existing\nalgorithms which are at least quadratic. Also, the approximation ratio of our\nalgorithm for $k\\geq 3$ is $3/2$ which is tight.

To\ninvestigate the ability to detect suicidal thoughts in Arabic tweets\nautomatically, we developed a novel Arabic suicidal tweets dataset, examined\nseveral machine learning models, including Na\\\"ive Bayes, Support Vector\nMachine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and XGBoost, trained on word\nfrequency and word embedding features, and investigated the ability of\npre-trained deep learning models, AraBert, AraELECTRA, and AraGPT2, to identify\nsuicidal thoughts in Arabic tweets.

The results\nof the deep learning models show that AraBert model outperforms other machine\nand deep learning models, achieving an accuracy of 91\\% and an F1-score of 88%,\nwhich significantly improves the detection of suicidal ideation in the Arabic\ntweets dataset.

Distinctively, DiffuGen employs prompt\ntemplating for adaptable image generation and textual inversion to enhance\ndiffusion model capabilities.",

      "title": "Suicidal Pedestrian: Generation of Safety-Critical Scenarios for\n  Autonomous Vehicles",
      "abstract": "Developing reliable autonomous driving algorithms poses challenges in\ntesting, particularly when it comes to safety-critical traffic scenarios\ninvolving pedestrians. An open question is how to simulate rare events, not\nnecessarily found in autonomous driving datasets or scripted simulations, but\nwhich can occur in testing, and, in the end may lead to severe pedestrian\nrelated accidents. This paper presents a method for designing a suicidal\npedestrian agent within the CARLA simulator, enabling the automatic generation\nof traffic scenarios for testing safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in\ndangerous situations with pedestrians. The pedestrian is modeled as a\nreinforcement learning (RL) agent with two custom reward functions that allow\nthe agent to either arbitrarily or with high velocity to collide with the AV.\nInstead of significantly constraining the initial locations and the pedestrian\nbehavior, we allow the pedestrian and autonomous car to be placed anywhere in\nthe environment and the pedestrian to roam freely to generate diverse\nscenarios. To assess the performance of the suicidal pedestrian and the target\nvehicle during testing, we propose three collision-oriented evaluation metrics.\nExperimental results involving two state-of-the-art autonomous driving\nalgorithms trained end-to-end with imitation learning from sensor data\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the suicidal pedestrian in identifying\ndecision errors made by autonomous vehicles controlled by the algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Wi-Fi signals may help realize low-cost and non-invasive human sensing, yet\nit can also be exploited by eavesdroppers to capture private information. Very\nfew studies rise to handle this privacy concern so far; they either jam all\nsensing attempts or rely on sophisticated technologies to support only a single\nsensing user, rendering them impractical for multi-user scenarios. Moreover,\nthese proposals all fail to exploit Wi-Fi's multiple-in multiple-out (MIMO)\ncapability. To this end, we propose MIMOCrypt, a privacy-preserving Wi-Fi\nsensing framework to support realistic multi-user scenarios. To thwart\nunauthorized eavesdropping while retaining the sensing and communication\ncapabilities for legitimate users, MIMOCrypt innovates in exploiting MIMO to\nphysically encrypt Wi-Fi channels, treating the sensed human activities as\nphysical plaintexts. The encryption scheme is further enhanced via an\noptimization framework, aiming to strike a balance among i) risk of\neavesdropping, ii) sensing accuracy, and iii) communication quality, upon\nsecurely conveying decryption keys to legitimate users. We implement a\nprototype of MIMOCrypt on an SDR platform and perform extensive experiments to\nevaluate its effectiveness in common application scenarios, especially\nprivacy-sensitive human gesture recognition.",

      "abstract": "Advanced persistent threat (APT) is a kind of stealthy, sophisticated, and\nlong-term cyberattack that has brought severe financial losses and critical\ninfrastructure damages. Existing works mainly focus on APT defense under stable\nnetwork topologies, while the problem under time-varying dynamic networks\n(e.g., vehicular networks) remains unexplored, which motivates our work.\nBesides, the spatiotemporal dynamics in defense resources, complex attackers'\nlateral movement behaviors, and lack of timely defense make APT defense a\nchallenging issue under time-varying networks. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel game-theoretical APT defense approach to promote real-time and optimal\ndefense strategy-making under both periodic time-varying and general\ntime-varying environments. Specifically, we first model the interactions\nbetween attackers and defenders in an APT process as a dynamic APT repair game,\nand then formulate the APT damage minimization problem as the precise\nprevention and control (PPAC) problem. To derive the optimal defense strategy\nunder both latency and defense resource constraints, we further devise an\nonline optimal control-based mechanism integrated with two backtracking-forward\nalgorithms to fastly derive the near-optimal solution of the PPAC problem in\nreal time. Extensive experiments are carried out, and the results demonstrate\nthat our proposed scheme can efficiently obtain optimal defense strategy in\n54481 ms under seven attack-defense interactions with 9.64$\\%$ resource\noccupancy in stimulated periodic time-varying and general time-varying\nnetworks. Besides, even under static networks, our proposed scheme still\noutperforms existing representative APT defense approaches in terms of service\nstability and defense resource utilization.",

      "abstract": "Transformer based large language models with emergent capabilities are\nbecoming increasingly ubiquitous in society. However, the task of understanding\nand interpreting their internal workings, in the context of adversarial\nattacks, remains largely unsolved. Gradient-based universal adversarial attacks\nhave been shown to be highly effective on large language models and potentially\ndangerous due to their input-agnostic nature. This work presents a novel\ngeometric perspective explaining universal adversarial attacks on large\nlanguage models. By attacking the 117M parameter GPT-2 model, we find evidence\nindicating that universal adversarial triggers could be embedding vectors which\nmerely approximate the semantic information in their adversarial training\nregion. This hypothesis is supported by white-box model analysis comprising\ndimensionality reduction and similarity measurement of hidden representations.\nWe believe this new geometric perspective on the underlying mechanism driving\nuniversal attacks could help us gain deeper insight into the internal workings\nand failure modes of LLMs, thus enabling their mitigation.",

When this occurs, the\nparticle moves at nearly light speed along special directions called the\nprincipal null directions (PNDs) of the electromagnetic field. This equilibrium\nis \"Aristotelian\" in that the particle velocity, rather than acceleration, is\ndetermined by the local electromagnetic field. In paper I of this series, we\nanalytically derived the complete formula for the particle velocity at leading\norder in its deviation from the PND, starting from the fundamental\nLandau-Lifshitz (LL) equation governing charged particle motion, and\ndemonstrated agreement with numerical solutions of the LL equation. We also\nidentified five necessary conditions on the field configuration for the\nequilibrium to occur. In this paper we study the entry into equilibrium using a\nsimilar combination of analytical and numerical techniques. We simplify the\nnecessary conditions and provide strong numerical evidence that they are also\nsufficient for equilibrium to occur. Based on exact and approximate solutions\nto the LL equation, we identify key timescales and properties of entry into\nequilibrium and show quantitative agreement with numerical simulations. Part of\nthis analysis shows analytically that the equilibrium is linearly stable and\nidentifies the presence of oscillations during entry, which may have\ndistinctive radiative signatures. Our results provide a solid foundation for\nusing the Aristotelian approximation when modeling relativistic plasmas with\nstrong electromagnetic fields.",

When $T_s$ is suppressed by Ta\ndoping, $T_c$ is also suppressed. Our findings suggest that the suppression of\n$T_s$ does not necessarily enhance superconductivity in MoTe$_2$. By connecting\nwith the findings of electron-doped MoTe$_2$, we argue that varying electron\ncarrier concentration can effectively tune $T_c$.

      "title": "Application of Machine Learning in Melanoma Detection and the\n  Identification of 'Ugly Duckling' and Suspicious Naevi: A Review",
      "abstract": "Skin lesions known as naevi exhibit diverse characteristics such as size,\nshape, and colouration. The concept of an \"Ugly Duckling Naevus\" comes into\nplay when monitoring for melanoma, referring to a lesion with distinctive\nfeatures that sets it apart from other lesions in the vicinity. As lesions\nwithin the same individual typically share similarities and follow a\npredictable pattern, an ugly duckling naevus stands out as unusual and may\nindicate the presence of a cancerous melanoma. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)\nhas become a significant player in the research and development field, as it\ncombines machine learning techniques with a variety of patient analysis\nmethods. Its aim is to increase accuracy and simplify decision-making, all\nwhile responding to the shortage of specialized professionals. These automated\nsystems are especially important in skin cancer diagnosis where specialist\navailability is limited. As a result, their use could lead to life-saving\nbenefits and cost reductions within healthcare. Given the drastic change in\nsurvival when comparing early stage to late-stage melanoma, early detection is\nvital for effective treatment and patient outcomes. Machine learning (ML) and\ndeep learning (DL) techniques have gained popularity in skin cancer\nclassification, effectively addressing challenges, and providing results\nequivalent to that of specialists. This article extensively covers modern\nMachine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms for detecting melanoma and\nsuspicious naevi. It begins with general information on skin cancer and\ndifferent types of naevi, then introduces AI, ML, DL, and CAD. The article then\ndiscusses the successful applications of various ML techniques like\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) for melanoma detection compared to\ndermatologists' performance. Lastly, it examines ML methods for UD naevus\ndetection and identifying suspicious naevi.",

For this, the images of an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) above a radar vehicle are panoptically segmented\nand mapped in the ground plane onto the radar images. The detected instances\nand segments in the camera image can then be applied directly as labels for the\nradar data. Owing to the advantageous bird's eye position, the UAV camera does\nnot suffer from optical occlusion and is capable of creating annotations within\nthe complete field of view of the radar.

We determined the surface profiles of\nthe CDGs and compared them to those of normal-sized disk galaxies (NDGs).

By contrast, the NDGs fit an exponential profile and have a negative\ncolor gradient on average. These results indicate that the structure and\nstellar population of the CDGs and NDGs differ.

      "abstract": "Atomic engineering in a solid-state material has the potential to\nfunctionalize the host with novel phenomena. STM-based lithographic techniques\nhave enabled the placement of individual phosphorus atoms at selective lattice\nsites of silicon with atomic precision. Here, we show that by placing four\nphosphorus donors spaced 10-15 nm apart from their neighbours in a linear\nchain, it is possible to realize coherent spin coupling between the end dopants\nof the chain, analogous to the superexchange interaction in magnetic materials.\nSince phosphorus atoms are a promising building block of a silicon quantum\ncomputer, this enables spin coupling between their bound electrons beyond\nnearest neighbours, allowing the qubits to be spaced out by 30-45 nm. The added\nflexibility in architecture brought about by this long-range coupling not only\nreduces gate densities but can also reduce correlated noise between qubits from\nlocal noise sources that are detrimental to error correction codes. We base our\ncalculations on a full configuration interaction technique in the atomistic\ntight-binding basis, solving the 4-electron problem exactly, over a domain of a\nmillion silicon atoms. Our calculations show that superexchange can be tuned\nelectrically through gate voltages where it is less sensitive to charge noise\nand donor placement errors.",

      "abstract": "Digital surface model generation using traditional multi-view stereo matching\n(MVS) performs poorly over non-Lambertian surfaces, with asynchronous\nacquisitions, or at discontinuities. Neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer a new\nparadigm for reconstructing surface geometries using continuous volumetric\nrepresentation. NeRF is self-supervised, does not require ground truth geometry\nfor training, and provides an elegant way to include in its representation\nphysical parameters about the scene, thus potentially remedying the challenging\nscenarios where MVS fails. However, NeRF and its variants require many views to\nproduce convincing scene's geometries which in earth observation satellite\nimaging is rare. In this paper we present SparseSat-NeRF (SpS-NeRF) - an\nextension of Sat-NeRF adapted to sparse satellite views. SpS-NeRF employs dense\ndepth supervision guided by crosscorrelation similarity metric provided by\ntraditional semi-global MVS matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach on stereo and tri-stereo Pleiades 1B/WorldView-3 images, and compare\nagainst NeRF and Sat-NeRF.

      "abstract": "Ductility quantifies a material's capacity for plastic deformation, and it is\na key property for preventing fracture driven failure in engineering parts.\nWhile some brittle materials exhibit improved ductility at small scales, the\nprocesses underlying this phenomenon are not well understood. This work\nestablishes a mechanism for the origin of ductility via an investigation of\nsize-affected fracture processes and polymer degree of conversion (DC) in\ntwo-photon lithography (TPL) fabricated materials. Microscale single edge notch\nbend ($\\mu$SENB) specimens were written with widths from 8 to 26 $\\mu$m and\nwith different laser powers and post-write thermal annealing to control the DC\nbetween 17\\% and 80\\%. We find that shifting from low to high DC predictably\ncauses a $\\sim$3x and $\\sim$4x increase in strength and bending stiffness,\nrespectively, but that there is a corresponding $\\sim$6x decrease in fracture\nenergy from 180 $J/m^2$ to 30 $J/m^2$. Notably, this reduced fracture energy is\naccompanied by a ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT) in the failure behavior.\nUsing finite element analysis, we demonstrate that the DBT occurs when the\nfracture yielding zone size ($r_p$) approaches the sample width, corresponding\nwith a known fracture size-affected transition from flaw-based to\nstrength-based failure. This finding provides a crucial insight that ductility\nis a size-induced property that occurs when features are reduced below a\ncharacteristic fracture length scale and that strength, stiffness, and\ntoughness alone are insufficient predictors of ductility.",

      "abstract": "The single-speaker singing voice synthesis (SVS) usually underperforms at\npitch values that are out of the singer's vocal range or associated with\nlimited training samples. Based on our previous work, this work proposes a\nmelody-unsupervised multi-speaker pre-training method conducted on a\nmulti-singer dataset to enhance the vocal range of the single-speaker, while\nnot degrading the timbre similarity. This pre-training method can be deployed\nto a large-scale multi-singer dataset, which only contains audio-and-lyrics\npairs without phonemic timing information and pitch annotation. Specifically,\nin the pre-training step, we design a phoneme predictor to produce the\nframe-level phoneme probability vectors as the phonemic timing information and\na speaker encoder to model the timbre variations of different singers, and\ndirectly estimate the frame-level f0 values from the audio to provide the pitch\ninformation. These pre-trained model parameters are delivered into the\nfine-tuning step as prior knowledge to enhance the single speaker's vocal\nrange. Moreover, this work also contributes to improving the sound quality and\nrhythm naturalness of the synthesized singing voices. It is the first to\nintroduce a differentiable duration regulator to improve the rhythm naturalness\nof the synthesized voice, and a bi-directional flow model to improve the sound\nquality. Experimental results verify that the proposed SVS system outperforms\nthe baseline on both sound quality and naturalness.",

      "abstract": "In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink systems, the\nphysical implementation of the base stations (BSs) requires the use of cheap\nand power-efficient power amplifiers (PAs) to avoid high hardware cost and high\npower consumption. However, such PAs usually have limited linear amplification\nranges. Nonlinear distortions arising from operation beyond the linear\namplification ranges can significantly degrade system performance. Existing\napproaches to handle the nonlinear distortions, such as digital predistortion\n(DPD), typically require accurate knowledge, or acquisition, of the PA transfer\nfunction. In this paper, we present a new concept for mitigation of the PA\ndistortions. Assuming a uniform linear array (ULA) at the BS, the idea is to\napply a Sigma-Delta ($\\Sigma \\Delta$) modulator to spatially shape the PA\ndistortions to the high-angle region. By having the system operating in the\nlow-angle region, the received signals are less affected by the PA distortions.\nTo demonstrate the potential of this spatial $\\Sigma \\Delta$ approach, we study\nthe application of our approach to the multi-user MIMO-orthogonal frequency\ndivision modulation (OFDM) downlink scenario. A symbol-level precoding (SLP)\nscheme and a zero-forcing (ZF) precoding scheme, with the new design\nrequirement by the spatial $\\Sigma \\Delta$ approach being taken into account,\nare developed. Numerical simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of\nthe developed $\\Sigma \\Delta$ precoding schemes.",

      "abstract": "This paper studies a class of strongly monotone games involving\nnon-cooperative agents that optimize their own time-varying cost functions. We\nassume that the agents can observe other agents' historical actions and choose\nactions that best respond to other agents' previous actions; we call this a\nbest response scheme. We start by analyzing the convergence rate of this best\nresponse scheme for standard time-invariant games. Specifically, we provide a\nsufficient condition on the strong monotonicity parameter of the time-invariant\ngames under which the proposed best response algorithm achieves exponential\nconvergence to the static Nash equilibrium. We further illustrate that this\nbest response algorithm may oscillate when the proposed sufficient condition\nfails to hold, which indicates that this condition is tight. Next, we analyze\nthis best response algorithm for time-varying games where the cost functions of\neach agent change over time. Under similar conditions as for time-invariant\ngames, we show that the proposed best response algorithm stays asymptotically\nclose to the evolving equilibrium. We do so by analyzing both the equilibrium\ntracking error and the dynamic regret. Numerical experiments on economic market\nproblems are presented to validate our analysis.",

      "abstract": "Either RGB images or inertial signals have been used for the task of motion\ncapture (mocap), but combining them together is a new and interesting topic. We\nbelieve that the combination is complementary and able to solve the inherent\ndifficulties of using one modality input, including occlusions, extreme\nlighting/texture, and out-of-view for visual mocap and global drifts for\ninertial mocap. To this end, we propose a method that fuses monocular images\nand sparse IMUs for real-time human motion capture. Our method contains a dual\ncoordinate strategy to fully explore the IMU signals with different goals in\nmotion capture. To be specific, besides one branch transforming the IMU signals\nto the camera coordinate system to combine with the image information, there is\nanother branch to learn from the IMU signals in the body root coordinate system\nto better estimate body poses. Furthermore, a hidden state feedback mechanism\nis proposed for both two branches to compensate for their own drawbacks in\nextreme input cases. Thus our method can easily switch between the two kinds of\nsignals or combine them in different cases to achieve a robust mocap. %The two\ndivided parts can help each other for better mocap results under different\nconditions. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that by delicately\ndesigning the fusion method, our technique significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art vision, IMU, and combined methods on both global orientation\nand local pose estimation.

Recent\nadvancements in cost-effective sequencing technologies have revolutionized the\nlandscape of cancer genomics, leading to a notable rise in the number of\nsequenced cancer patient genomes, enabling large-scale computational studies.\nIn this study, we delve into the BRCA mutations in the dbSNP, housing an\nextensive repository of 41,177 and 44,205 genetic mutations for BRCA1 and\nBRCA2, respectively. Employing meticulous computational analysis from an\numbrella perspective, our research unveils intriguing findings pertaining to a\nnumber of critical aspects. Namely, we discover that the majority of BRCA\nmutations in dbSNP have unknown clinical significance. We find that, although\nexon 11 for both genes contains the majority of the mutations and may seem as\nif it is a mutation hot spot, upon analyzing mutations per base pair, we find\nthat all exons exhibit similar levels of mutations. Investigating mutations\nwithin introns, while we observe that the recorded mutations are generally\nuniformly distributed, almost all of the pathogenic mutations in introns are\nlocated close to splicing regions (at the beginning or the end). In addition to\nthe findings mentioned earlier, we have also made other discoveries concerning\nmutation types and the level of confidence in observations within the dbSNP\ndatabase.",

      "abstract": "High-fidelity numerical simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs)\ngiven a restricted computational budget can significantly limit the number of\nparameter configurations considered and/or time window evaluated for modeling a\ngiven system. Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling aims to leverage less accurate,\nlower-fidelity models that are computationally inexpensive in order to enhance\npredictive accuracy when high-fidelity data are limited or scarce. However,\nlow-fidelity models, while often displaying important qualitative\nspatio-temporal features, fail to accurately capture the onset of instability\nand critical transients observed in the high-fidelity models, making them\nimpractical as surrogate models. To address this shortcoming, we present a new\ndata-driven strategy that combines dimensionality reduction with multi-fidelity\nneural network surrogates. The key idea is to generate a spatial basis by\napplying the classical proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to high-fidelity\nsolution snapshots, and approximate the dynamics of the reduced states -\ntime-parameter-dependent expansion coefficients of the POD basis - using a\nmulti-fidelity long-short term memory (LSTM) network. By mapping low-fidelity\nreduced states to their high-fidelity counterpart, the proposed reduced-order\nsurrogate model enables the efficient recovery of full solution fields over\ntime and parameter variations in a non-intrusive manner. The generality and\nrobustness of this method is demonstrated by a collection of parametrized,\ntime-dependent PDE problems where the low-fidelity model can be defined by\ncoarser meshes and/or time stepping, as well as by misspecified physical\nfeatures. Importantly, the onset of instabilities and transients are well\ncaptured by this surrogate modeling technique.",

      "abstract": "Diagnostic investigation has an important role in risk stratification and\nclinical decision making of patients with suspected and documented Coronary\nArtery Disease (CAD). However, the majority of existing tools are primarily\nfocused on the selection of gatekeeper tests, whereas only a handful of systems\ncontain information regarding the downstream testing or treatment. We propose a\nmulti-task deep learning model to support risk stratification and down-stream\ntest selection for patients undergoing Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography\n(CCTA). The analysis included 14,021 patients who underwent CCTA between 2006\nand 2017. Our novel multitask deep learning framework extends the state-of-the\nart Perceiver model to deal with real-world CCTA report data. Our model\nachieved an Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) of\n0.76 in CAD risk stratification, and 0.72 AUC in predicting downstream tests.\nOur proposed deep learning model can accurately estimate the likelihood of CAD\nand provide recommended downstream tests based on prior CCTA data. In clinical\npractice, the utilization of such an approach could bring a paradigm shift in\nrisk stratification and downstream management. Despite significant progress\nusing deep learning models for tabular data, they do not outperform gradient\nboosting decision trees, and further research is required in this area.\nHowever, neural networks appear to benefit more readily from multi-task\nlearning than tree-based models. This could offset the shortcomings of using\nsingle task learning approach when working with tabular data.",

To do that,\nwe use attention scores to determine which parts of the input data the model\nshould focus on when making predictions. Attention scores are calculated for\neach input feature, with a higher score indicating the greater significance of\nthat feature in predicting the output. Initially, these scores are determined\nfor the target human position, velocity, and their neighboring individual's\npositions and velocities. By using attention scores, our model can prioritize\nthe most relevant information in the input data and make more accurate\npredictions. We extract attention scores from our attention mechanism and\nintegrate them into the trajectory prediction module to predict human future\ntrajectories. To achieve this, we introduce a new neural layer that processes\nattention scores after extracting them and concatenates them with positional\ninformation. We evaluate our approach on the publicly available ETH and UCY\ndatasets and measure its performance using the final displacement error (FDE)\nand average displacement error (ADE) metrics. We show that our modified\nalgorithm performs better than the Social LSTM in predicting the future\ntrajectory of pedestrians in crowded spaces.

      "title": "MuraNet: Multi-task Floor Plan Recognition with Relation Attention",
      "abstract": "The recognition of information in floor plan data requires the use of\ndetection and segmentation models. However, relying on several single-task\nmodels can result in ineffective utilization of relevant information when there\nare multiple tasks present simultaneously. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce MuraNet, an attention-based multi-task model for segmentation and\ndetection tasks in floor plan data. In MuraNet, we adopt a unified encoder\ncalled MURA as the backbone with two separated branches: an enhanced\nsegmentation decoder branch and a decoupled detection head branch based on\nYOLOX, for segmentation and detection tasks respectively. The architecture of\nMuraNet is designed to leverage the fact that walls, doors, and windows usually\nconstitute the primary structure of a floor plan's architecture. By jointly\ntraining the model on both detection and segmentation tasks, we believe MuraNet\ncan effectively extract and utilize relevant features for both tasks. Our\nexperiments on the CubiCasa5k public dataset show that MuraNet improves\nconvergence speed during training compared to single-task models like U-Net and\nYOLOv3. Moreover, we observe improvements in the average AP and IoU in\ndetection and segmentation tasks, respectively.Our ablation experiments\ndemonstrate that the attention-based unified backbone of MuraNet achieves\nbetter feature extraction in floor plan recognition tasks, and the use of\ndecoupled multi-head branches for different tasks further improves model\nperformance. We believe that our proposed MuraNet model can address the\ndisadvantages of single-task models and improve the accuracy and efficiency of\nfloor plan data recognition.",

The objective of this\npaper is the comparison of two multistep operational algorithms of the\nintelligent network: one based on discrete dynamics and the other on continuous\ndynamics. By means of numerical analysis, it is shown that, depending on the\nnetwork parameters, the characteristic probabilities for continuous and\ndiscrete operations can exhibit either close or drastically different behavior.\nThus, depending on which algorithm is employed, either discrete or continuous,\ntheoretical predictions can be rather different, which does not allow for a\nuniquely defined description of practical problems.

Our study aims to better understand the behavior of the\nco-moving velocity by analyzing simulation data under various wetting\nconditions. The simulations were conducted using the Lattice-Boltzmann\ncolor-fluid model and evaluated the relative permeability for different wetting\nconditions on the same rock.

Surprisingly, it was found that the\ncoefficients of the constitutive equation were nearly the same for all wetting\nconditions. Based on these results, a simple approach was proposed to\nreconstruct the oil phase relative permeability using only the co-moving\nvelocity relationship and water phase relative permeability. This proposed\nmethod provides new insights into the dependency of relative permeability\ncurves, which has implications for the history matching of production data and\nsolving the associated inverse problem. The research findings contribute to a\nbetter understanding of the impact of wettability on fluid flow in porous media\nand provide a practical approach for estimating relative permeability based on\nthe co-moving velocity relationship, which has never been shown before.",

Different\nentities can further improve the performance of those LLMs on their specific\ndownstream tasks by fine-tuning LLMs. When several entities have similar\ninterested tasks, but their data cannot be shared because of privacy concerns\nregulations, federated learning (FL) is a mainstream solution to leverage the\ndata of different entities. However, fine-tuning LLMs in federated learning\nsettings still lacks adequate support from existing FL frameworks because it\nhas to deal with optimizing the consumption of significant communication and\ncomputational resources, data preparation for different tasks, and distinct\ninformation protection demands. This paper first discusses these challenges of\nfederated fine-tuning LLMs, and introduces our package FS-LLM as a main\ncontribution, which consists of the following components: (1) we build an\nend-to-end benchmarking pipeline, automizing the processes of dataset\npreprocessing, federated fine-tuning execution, and performance evaluation on\nfederated LLM fine-tuning; (2) we provide comprehensive federated\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning algorithm implementations and versatile\nprogramming interfaces for future extension in FL scenarios with low\ncommunication and computation costs, even without accessing the full model; (3)\nwe adopt several accelerating and resource-efficient operators for fine-tuning\nLLMs with limited resources and the flexible pluggable sub-routines for\ninterdisciplinary study. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the\neffectiveness of FS-LLM and benchmark advanced LLMs with state-of-the-art\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning algorithms in FL settings, which also yields\nvaluable insights into federated fine-tuning LLMs for the research community.\nTo facilitate further research and adoption, we release FS-LLM at\nhttps://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope/tree/llm.",

      "abstract": "The recently developed method Lasso Monte Carlo (LMC) for uncertainty\nquantification is applied to the characterisation of spent nuclear fuel. The\npropagation of nuclear data uncertainties to the output of calculations is an\noften required procedure in nuclear computations. Commonly used methods such as\nMonte Carlo, linear error propagation, or surrogate modelling suffer from being\ncomputationally intensive, biased, or ill-suited for high-dimensional settings\nsuch as in the case of nuclear data. The LMC method combines multilevel Monte\nCarlo and machine learning to compute unbiased estimates of the uncertainty, at\na lower computational cost than Monte Carlo, even in high-dimensional cases.\nHere LMC is applied to the calculations of decay heat, nuclide concentrations,\nand criticality of spent nuclear fuel placed in disposal canisters. The\nuncertainty quantification in this case is crucial to reduce the risks and\ncosts of disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The results show that LMC is unbiased\nand has a higher accuracy than simple Monte Carlo.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning models have undeniably achieved impressive performance\nacross a range of applications. However, their often perceived black-box\nnature, and lack of transparency in decision-making, have raised concerns about\nunderstanding their predictions. To tackle this challenge, researchers have\ndeveloped methods to provide explanations for machine learning models. In this\npaper, we introduce LaPLACE-explainer, designed to provide probabilistic\ncause-and-effect explanations for any classifier operating on tabular data, in\na human-understandable manner. The LaPLACE-Explainer component leverages the\nconcept of a Markov blanket to establish statistical boundaries between\nrelevant and non-relevant features automatically. This approach results in the\nautomatic generation of optimal feature subsets, serving as explanations for\npredictions. Importantly, this eliminates the need to predetermine a fixed\nnumber N of top features as explanations, enhancing the flexibility and\nadaptability of our methodology. Through the incorporation of conditional\nprobabilities, our approach offers probabilistic causal explanations and\noutperforms LIME and SHAP (well-known model-agnostic explainers) in terms of\nlocal accuracy and consistency of explained features. LaPLACE's soundness,\nconsistency, local accuracy, and adaptability are rigorously validated across\nvarious classification models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical\nutility of these explanations via experiments with both simulated and\nreal-world datasets. This encompasses addressing trust-related issues, such as\nevaluating prediction reliability, facilitating model selection, enhancing\ntrustworthiness, and identifying fairness-related concerns within classifiers.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging, the process of classifying words\ninto their respective parts of speech (e.g., verb or noun), is essential in\nvarious natural language processing applications. POS tagging is a crucial\npreprocessing task for applications like machine translation, question\nanswering, sentiment analysis, etc. However, existing corpora for POS tagging\nin Persian mainly consist of formal texts, such as daily news and newspapers.\nAs a result, smart POS tools, machine learning models, and deep learning models\ntrained on these corpora may not perform optimally for processing colloquial\ntext in social network analysis. Method: This paper introduces a novel corpus,\n\"Colloquial Persian POS\" (CPPOS), specifically designed to support colloquial\nPersian text. The corpus includes formal and informal text collected from\nvarious domains such as political, social, and commercial on Telegram, Twitter,\nand Instagram more than 520K labeled tokens. After collecting posts from these\nsocial platforms for one year, special preprocessing steps were conducted,\nincluding normalization, sentence tokenizing, and word tokenizing for social\ntext. The tokens and sentences were then manually annotated and verified by a\nteam of linguistic experts. This study also defines a POS tagging guideline for\nannotating the data and conducting the annotation process. Results: To evaluate\nthe quality of CPPOS, various deep learning models, such as the RNN family,\nwere trained using the constructed corpus. A comparison with another well-known\nPersian POS corpus named \"Bijankhan\" and the Persian Hazm POS tool trained on\nBijankhan revealed that our model trained on CPPOS outperforms them. With the\nnew corpus and the BiLSTM deep neural model, we achieved a 14% improvement over\nthe previous dataset.",

      "abstract": "The evolving sophistication and intricacies of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nyield unprecedented advancements, yet they simultaneously demand considerable\ncomputational resources and incur significant costs. To alleviate these\nchallenges, this paper introduces a novel, simple, and effective method named\n``\\growlength'' to accelerate the pretraining process of LLMs. Our method\nprogressively increases the training length throughout the pretraining phase,\nthereby mitigating computational costs and enhancing efficiency. For instance,\nit begins with a sequence length of 128 and progressively extends to 4096. This\napproach enables models to process a larger number of tokens within limited\ntime frames, potentially boosting their performance. In other words, the\nefficiency gain is derived from training with shorter sequences optimizing the\nutilization of resources. Our extensive experiments with various\nstate-of-the-art LLMs have revealed that models trained using our method not\nonly converge more swiftly but also exhibit superior performance metrics\ncompared to those trained with existing methods. Furthermore, our method for\nLLMs pretraining acceleration does not require any additional engineering\nefforts, making it a practical solution in the realm of LLMs.",

The space is represented globally using a directed region graph, where\na region is a landmark that needs to be visited (inspected). We devise a fast\nmixing Markov chain to find an ergodic route that traverses this graph so that\nthe region visitation frequency is proportional to its anomaly detection\nuncertainty, while satisfying the edge directionality (region transition)\nconstraint(s).

      "abstract": "In recent years, quantum computing has entered the Noisy Intermediate-Scale\nQuantum (NISQ). However, NISQ devices have inherent limitations in terms of\nconnectivity and hardware noise, necessitating the transformation of quantum\nlogic circuits for correct execution on NISQ chips. The synthesis of CNOT\ncircuits considering physical constraints can transform quantum algorithms into\nlow-level quantum circuits, which can be directly executed on physical chips.\nIn the current trend, quantum chip architectures without Hamiltonian paths are\ngradually replacing architectures with Hamiltonian paths due to their\nscalability and low-noise characteristics. To this end, this paper addresses\nthe nearest neighbor synthesis of CNOT circuits in the architecture with and\nwithout Hamiltonian paths, aiming to enhance the fidelity of the circuits after\nexecution. Firstly, a key-qubit priority mapping model for the general\narchitecture with and without Hamiltonian paths is proposed. Secondly, the\ninitial mapping is further improved by using tabu search to reduce the number\nof CNOT gates after circuit synthesis and enhance its fidelity. Finally, the\nnoise-aware CNOT circuit nearest neighbor synthesis algorithm for the general\narchitecture is proposed based on the key-qubit priority mapping model.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method can enhance the fidelity of\nthe CNOT circuit by about 64.7% on a real quantum computing device, achieving a\nsignificant optimization effect. Furthermore, the method can be extended to\nother circuits, thereby improving the overall performance of quantum computing\non NISQ devices.",

Numerous safety procedures were set up to track and recognize any illicit\nactivity on the network's infrastructure. IDS are the best way to resist and\nrecognize intrusions on internet connections and digital technologies. To\nclassify network traffic as normal or anomalous, Machine Learning (ML)\nclassifiers are increasingly utilized. An IDS with machine learning increases\nthe accuracy with which security attacks are detected. This paper focuses on\nintrusion detection systems (IDSs) analysis using ML techniques. IDSs utilizing\nML techniques are efficient and precise at identifying network assaults. In\ndata with large dimensional spaces, however, the efficacy of these systems\ndegrades. correspondingly, the case is essential to execute a feasible feature\nremoval technique capable of getting rid of characteristics that have little\neffect on the classification process. In this paper, we analyze the KDD\nCUP-'99' intrusion detection dataset used for training and validating ML\nmodels. Then, we implement ML classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision\nTree, K-Nearest Neighbour, Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Multinomial\nNaive Bayes, XG-Boost Classifier, Ada-Boost, Random Forest, SVM, Rocchio\nclassifier, Ridge, Passive-Aggressive classifier, ANN besides Perceptron (PPN),\nthe optimal classifiers are determined by comparing the results of Stochastic\nGradient Descent and back-propagation neural networks for IDS, Conventional\ncategorization indicators, such as \"accuracy, precision, recall, and the\nf1-measure, have been used to evaluate the performance of the ML classification\nalgorithms.",

      "abstract": "Trapped-ion applications, such as in quantum information, precision\nmeasurements, optical clocks, and mass spectrometry, rely on specialized\nhigh-performance ion traps. The latter applications typically employ\ntraditional machining to customize macroscopic 3D Paul traps, while quantum\ninformation processing experiments usually rely on photo-lithographic\ntechniques to miniaturize the traps and meet scalability requirements. Using\nphotolithography, however, it is challenging to fabricate the complex\nthree-dimensional electrode structures required for optimal confinement. Here\nwe address these limitations by adopting a high-resolution 3D printing\ntechnology based on two-photon polymerization supporting fabrication of large\narrays of high-performance miniaturized 3D traps. We show that 3D-printed ion\ntraps combine the advantages of traditionally machined 3D traps with the\nminiaturization provided by photolithography by confining single calcium ions\nin a small 3D-printed ion trap with radial trap frequencies ranging from 2 MHz\nto 24 MHz. The tight confinement eases ion cooling requirements and allows us\nto demonstrate high-fidelity coherent operations on an optical qubit after only\nDoppler cooling. With 3D printing technology, the design freedom is drastically\nexpanded without sacrificing scalability and precision so that ion trap\ngeometries can be optimized for higher performance and better functionality.",

      "abstract": "The plateau phase in the radio afterglows has been observed in very few\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and 27 radio light curves with plateau phase were\nacquired from the published literature in this article. We obtain the related\nparameters of the radio plateau, such as temporal indexes during the plateau\nphase ($\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$), break time ($\\Tbz$) and the corresponding\nradio flux ($F_{\\rm b}$). The two parameter Dainotti relation between the break\ntime of the plateau and the corresponding break luminosity ($\\Lbz$) in radio\nband is $\\Lbz \\propto \\Tbz^{-1.20\\pm0.24}$. Including the isotropic energy\n$\\Eiso$ and the peak energy $\\Epi$, the three parameter correlations for the\nradio plateaus are written as $\\Lbz \\propto \\Tbz^{-1.01 \\pm 0.24} \\Eiso^{0.18\n\\pm 0.09}$ and $\\Lbz \\propto \\Tbz^{-1.18 \\pm 0.27} \\Epi^{0.05 \\pm 0.28}$,\nrespectively. The correlations are less consistent with that of X-ray and\noptical plateaus, implying that radio plateaus may have a different physical\nmechanism. The typical frequencies crossing the observational band may be a\nreasonable hypothesis that causes the breaks of the radio afterglows. We\ncalibrate GRBs empirical luminosity correlations as standard candle for\nconstraining cosmological parameters, and find that our samples can constrain\nthe flat $\\Lambda$CDM model well, while are not sensitive to non-flat\n${\\Lambda}$CDM model. By combining GRBs with other probes, such as SN and CMB,\nthe constraints on cosmological parameters are $\\om = 0.297\\pm0.006$ for the\nflat ${\\Lambda}$CDM model and $\\om = 0.283\\pm0.008$, $\\oL = 0.711\\pm0.006$ for\nthe non-flat ${\\Lambda}$CDM model, respectively.",

However, existing PCMs for Task-oriented dialog (TOD) are\ninsufficient for capturing the sequential nature of the TOD-related tasks, as\nwell as for learning dialog policy information. To alleviate these problems,\nthis paper proposes a task-progressive PCM with two policy-aware pre-training\ntasks. The model is pre-trained through three stages where TOD-related tasks\nare progressively employed according to the task logic of the TOD system. A\nglobal policy consistency task is designed to capture the multi-turn dialog\npolicy sequential relation, and an act-based contrastive learning task is\ndesigned to capture similarities among samples with the same dialog policy. Our\nmodel achieves better results on both MultiWOZ and In-Car end-to-end dialog\nmodeling benchmarks with only 18\\% parameters and 25\\% pre-training data\ncompared to the previous state-of-the-art PCM, GALAXY.",

      "abstract": "For any fixed positive integer $r$ and a given budget $k$, the\n$r$-\\textsc{Eigenvalue Vertex Deletion} ($r$-EVD) problem asks if a graph $G$\nadmits a subset $S$ of at most $k$ vertices such that the adjacency matrix of\n$G\\setminus S$ has at most $r$ distinct eigenvalues. The edge deletion, edge\naddition, and edge editing variants are defined analogously. For $r = 1$,\n$r$-EVD is equivalent to the Vertex Cover problem. For $r = 2$, it turns out\nthat $r$-EVD amounts to removing a subset $S$ of at most $k$ vertices so that\n$G\\setminus S$ is a cluster graph where all connected components have the same\nsize.\n  We show that $r$-EVD is NP-complete even on bipartite graphs with maximum\ndegree four for every fixed $r > 2$, and FPT when parameterized by the solution\nsize and the maximum degree of the graph. We also establish several results for\nthe special case when $r = 2$. For the vertex deletion variant, we show that\n$2$-EVD is NP-complete even on triangle-free and $3d$-regular graphs for any\n$d\\geq 2$, and also NP-complete on $d$-regular graphs for any $d\\geq 8$. The\nedge deletion, addition, and editing variants are all NP-complete for $r = 2$.\nThe edge deletion problem admits a polynomial time algorithm if the input is a\ncluster graph, while the edge addition variant is hard even when the input is a\ncluster graph. We show that the edge addition variant has a quadratic kernel.\nThe edge deletion and vertex deletion variants are FPT when parameterized by\nthe solution size alone.\n  Our main contribution is to develop the complexity landscape for the problem\nof modifying a graph with the aim of reducing the number of distinct\neigenvalues in the spectrum of its adjacency matrix. It turns out that this\ncaptures, apart from Vertex Cover, also a natural variation of the problem of\nmodifying to a cluster graph as a special case, which we believe may be of\nindependent interest.",

Utilizing an impulse\nstochastic control framework, we formulate the no-arbitrage GMWB pricing\nproblem as a time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) Quasi-Variational\nInequality (QVI) having three spatial dimensions with cross derivative terms.\nThrough a novel numerical approach built upon a combination of a\nsemi-Lagrangian method and the Green's function of an associated linear partial\nintegro-differential equation, we develop an $\\epsilon$-monotone Fourier\npricing method, where $\\epsilon > 0$ is a monotonicity tolerance. Together with\na provable strong comparison result for the HJB-QVI, we mathematically\ndemonstrate convergence of the proposed scheme to the viscosity solution of the\nHJB-QVI as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. We present a comprehensive study of the impact of\nsimultaneously considering jumps in the sub-account process and stochastic\ninterest rate on the no-arbitrage prices and fair insurance fees of GMWBs, as\nwell as on the holder's optimal withdrawal behaviors.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose Skip-Plan, a condensed action space learning method\nfor procedure planning in instructional videos. Current procedure planning\nmethods all stick to the state-action pair prediction at every timestep and\ngenerate actions adjacently. Although it coincides with human intuition, such a\nmethodology consistently struggles with high-dimensional state supervision and\nerror accumulation on action sequences. In this work, we abstract the procedure\nplanning problem as a mathematical chain model. By skipping uncertain nodes and\nedges in action chains, we transfer long and complex sequence functions into\nshort but reliable ones in two ways. First, we skip all the intermediate state\nsupervision and only focus on action predictions. Second, we decompose\nrelatively long chains into multiple short sub-chains by skipping unreliable\nintermediate actions. By this means, our model explores all sorts of reliable\nsub-relations within an action sequence in the condensed action space.\nExtensive experiments show Skip-Plan achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthe CrossTask and COIN benchmarks for procedure planning.",

The DP A2AuScX6 halides were studied for their\nstructural phase stability and optoelectronic properties in order to identify\npotential materials for energy harvesting systems. The stability criteria were\nverified by computing the formation energy, binding energy, phonon dispersion\ncurve, stiffness constants, tolerance, and octahedral factors. The electronic\nband structure, carrier effective mass, density of states (DOS), and charge\ndensity distribution were calculated to reveal the nature of electronic\nconductivity and the chemical bonding nature present within them. For Cs2AuScX6\n(Rb2AuScX6) [X = Cl, Br, I], the corresponding values of band gap [using\nTB-mBJ] are 1.88 (1.93), 1.68 (1.71), and 1.30 (1.32) eV. The optical constants\n(dielectric function, absorption coefficient, refractive index, energy loss\nfunction, photoconductivity, and reflectivity) were also calculated to get more\ninsights into their electronic nature. For Cs2AuScX6 (Rb2AuScX6) [X = Cl, Br,\nI], the absorption coefficient in the visible range are 3.33 (3.45) 105 cm-1,\n2.70 (2.81) 105 cm-1, and 2.13 (2.18) 105 cm-1, respectively. We also\ninvestigated the thermoelectric properties to predict promising applications in\nthermoelectric devices. Our calculations revealed high ZT values of 0.92, 1.07,\nand 1.06 for Cs2AuScX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) and 0.97, 0.99, and 1.01 for Rb2AuScX6\n(X = Cl, Br, I) at 300 K. To further aid in predicting any novel materials,\nroutine research was also done on the thermo-mechanical characteristics.

However, thermodynamic quantities,\nsuch as the entropy production rate, are generally severely affected by\ncoarse-graining procedures.

      "title": "Transition path theory for diffusive search with stochastic resetting",
      "abstract": "Many chemical reactions can be formulated in terms of particle diffusion in a\ncomplex energy landscape. Transition path theory (TPT) is a theoretical\nframework for describing the direct (reaction) pathways from reactant to\nproduct states within this energy landscape, and calculating the effective\nreaction rate. It is now the standard method for analyzing rare events between\nlong lived states. In this paper, we consider a completely different\napplication of TPT, namely, a dual-aspect diffusive search process in which a\nparticle alternates between collecting cargo from a source domain $A$ and then\ndelivering it to a target domain $B$. The rate of resource accumulation at the\ntarget, $k_{AB}$, is determined by the statistics of direct (reactive or\ntransport) paths from A to B. Rather than considering diffusion in a complex\nenergy landscape, we focus on pure diffusion with stochastic resetting.\nResetting introduces two non-trivial problems in the application of TPT. First,\nthe process is not time-reversal invariant, which is reflected by the fact that\nthere exists a unique non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS). Second,\ncalculating $k_{AB}$ involves determining the total probability flux of direct\ntransport paths across a dividing surface $S$ between $A$ and $B$. This\nrequires taking into account discontinuous jumps across $S$ due to resetting.\nWe derive a general expression for $k_{AB}$ and show that it is independent of\nthe choice of dividing surface. Finally, using the example of diffusion in a\nfinite interval, we show that there exists an optimal resetting rate at which\n$k_{AB}$ is maximized. We explore how this feature depends on model parameters.",

      "abstract": "Within the realm of computer vision, self-supervised learning (SSL) pertains\nto training pre-trained image encoders utilizing a substantial quantity of\nunlabeled images. Pre-trained image encoders can serve as feature extractors,\nfacilitating the construction of downstream classifiers for various tasks.\nHowever, the use of SSL has led to an increase in security research related to\nvarious backdoor attacks. Currently, the trigger patterns used in backdoor\nattacks on SSL are mostly visible or static (sample-agnostic), making backdoors\nless covert and significantly affecting the attack performance. In this work,\nwe propose GhostEncoder, the first dynamic invisible backdoor attack on SSL.\nUnlike existing backdoor attacks on SSL, which use visible or static trigger\npatterns, GhostEncoder utilizes image steganography techniques to encode hidden\ninformation into benign images and generate backdoor samples. We then fine-tune\nthe pre-trained image encoder on a manipulation dataset to inject the backdoor,\nenabling downstream classifiers built upon the backdoored encoder to inherit\nthe backdoor behavior for target downstream tasks. We evaluate GhostEncoder on\nthree downstream tasks and results demonstrate that GhostEncoder provides\npractical stealthiness on images and deceives the victim model with a high\nattack success rate without compromising its utility.

      "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for\nprivacy-enhancement and latency minimization in various real-world\napplications, such as transportation, communications, and healthcare. FL\nendeavors to bring Machine Learning (ML) down to the edge by harnessing data\nfrom million of devices and IoT sensors, thus enabling rapid responses to\ndynamic environments and yielding highly personalized results. However, the\nincreased amount of sensors across diverse applications poses challenges in\nterms of communication and resource allocation, hindering the participation of\nall devices in the federated process and prompting the need for effective FL\nclient selection. To address this issue, we propose Cellular Automaton-based\nClient Selection (CA-CS), a novel client selection algorithm, which leverages\nCellular Automata (CA) as models to effectively capture spatio-temporal changes\nin a fast-evolving environment. CA-CS considers the computational resources and\ncommunication capacity of each participating client, while also accounting for\ninter-client interactions between neighbors during the client selection\nprocess, enabling intelligent client selection for online FL processes on data\nstreams that closely resemble real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a\nthorough evaluation of the proposed CA-CS algorithm using MNIST and CIFAR-10\ndatasets, while making a direct comparison against a uniformly random client\nselection scheme.

However, the availability of\ngood-quality fingerprints is challenging, making recognition difficult.\nFingerprint images might be degraded with a poor ridge structure and noisy or\nless contrasting backgrounds. Hence, fingerprint enhancement plays a vital role\nin the early stages of the fingerprint recognition/verification pipeline. In\nthis paper, we investigate and improvise the encoder-decoder style architecture\nand suggest intuitive modifications to U-Net to enhance low-quality\nfingerprints effectively. We investigate the use of Discrete Wavelet Transform\n(DWT) for fingerprint enhancement and use a wavelet attention module instead of\nmax pooling which proves advantageous for our task. Moreover, we replace\nregular convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions, which significantly\nreduces the memory footprint of the model without degrading the performance. We\nalso demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge with fingerprint minutiae\nprediction task can improve fingerprint reconstruction through multi-task\nlearning. Furthermore, we also integrate the orientation estimation task to\npropagate the knowledge of ridge orientations to enhance the performance\nfurther.

      "abstract": "Successful information propagation from source to destination in Vehicular\nAdhoc Network (VANET) can be hampered by the presence of neighbouring attacker\nnodes causing unwanted packet dropping. Potential attackers change their\nbehaviour over time and remain undetected due to the ad-hoc nature of VANET.\nCapturing the dynamic attacker behaviour and updating the corresponding\nneighbourhood information without compromising the quality of service\nrequirements is an ongoing challenge. This work proposes a Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) based neighbour selection framework for VANET with an adaptive\ntrust management system to capture the behavioural changes of potential\nattackers and to dynamically update the neighbourhood information. In contrast\nto existing works, we consider trust and link-life time in unison as neighbour\nselection criteria to achieve trustworthy communication. Our adaptive trust\nmodel takes into account the social relationship, time and confidence in trust\nobservation to avoid four types of attackers. To update the neighbourhood\ninformation, our framework sets the learning rate of the RL agent according to\nthe velocities of the neighbour nodes to improve the model's adaptability to\nnetwork topology changes. Results demonstrate that our method can take less\nnumber of hops to the destination for large network sizes while can response is\nup to 54 percent faster compared to a baseline method. Also, the proposed model\ncan outperform the other baseline method by reducing the packet dropping rate\nup to 57 percent caused by the attacker.",

This research proposes a workflow and deep\nlearning-based segmentation models to automatically assess tumor-vessel\ninvolvement, a key factor in determining tumor resectability. Correct\nassessment of resectability is vital to determine treatment options. The\nproposed workflow involves processing CT scans to segment the tumor and\nvascular structures, analyzing spatial relationships and the extent of vascular\ninvolvement, which follows a similar way of working as expert radiologists in\nPDAC assessment. Three segmentation architectures (nnU-Net, 3D U-Net, and\nProbabilistic 3D U-Net) achieve a high accuracy in segmenting veins, arteries,\nand the tumor. The segmentations enable automated detection of tumor\ninvolvement with high accuracy (0.88 sensitivity and 0.86 specificity) and\nautomated computation of the degree of tumor-vessel contact. Additionally, due\nto significant inter-observer variability in these important structures, we\npresent the uncertainty captured by each of the models to further increase\ninsights into the predicted involvement.

      "abstract": "The problem of how to take the right actions to make profits in sequential\nprocess continues to be difficult due to the quick dynamics and a significant\namount of uncertainty in many application scenarios. In such complicated\nenvironments, reinforcement learning (RL), a reward-oriented strategy for\noptimum control, has emerged as a potential technique to address this strategic\ndecision-making issue. However, reinforcement learning also has some\nshortcomings that make it unsuitable for solving many financial problems,\nexcessive resource consumption, and inability to quickly obtain optimal\nsolutions, making it unsuitable for quantitative trading markets. In this\nstudy, we use two methods to overcome the issue with contextual information:\ncontextual Thompson sampling and reinforcement learning under supervision which\ncan accelerate the iterations in search of the best answer. In order to\ninvestigate strategic trading in quantitative markets, we merged the earlier\nfinancial trading strategy known as constant proportion portfolio insurance\n(CPPI) into deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). The experimental results\nshow that both methods can accelerate the progress of reinforcement learning to\nobtain the optimal solution.",

The following-up observation\nconfirms the quasi-regularly changes of the drifting rate about every 50\nperiods. We determine the drift rate $D$ through a linear fit to the\npulse-central longitudes of subpulses in a drifting band, and determine $P_3$\nfrom the cross-points of two fitted lines at the zero longitude for two\nneighbored drifting bands. The low frequency modulation of about every 50\nperiods is found on variations of not only pulse intensity but also drift\nparameters. In most of low frequency modulation cycles, the integrated pulse\nintensity $I$ and the absolute drift rate $|D|$ tend to increase first and then\ndecrease, and the drifting periodicity $P_3$ varies just in the opposite. In\naddition, the phase-forward intensity-enhancement is observed in many\nmodulation cycles. Based on our polarization data, the average PA curve for\npulses with a smaller $|D|$ and larger $P_3$ is slightly steep in the leading\nedge of pulse profile compared with that of the fully averaged profile.",

In this study, we demonstrate that\n{\\alpha}-Sn undergoes a phase transition to another allotrope {\\beta}-Sn with\nsuperconductivity at low temperature by irradiating with a focused Ga ion beam\n(FIB). To clarify the transition mechanism, we performed X-ray photoemission\nspectroscopy (XPS) measurements on an {\\alpha}-Sn thin film irradiated with FIB\nand an as-grown {\\alpha}-Sn thin film.

Furthermore, the difference in the chemical\nstates between {\\alpha}-Sn and {\\beta}-Sn can be quantitatively explained by\nthe crystal structures rather than the degree of metallicity reflecting the\nconductivity.

      "abstract": "Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit impressive abilities\nto perceive images and follow open-ended instructions. The capabilities of\nMLLMs depend on two crucial factors: the model architecture to facilitate the\nfeature alignment of visual modules and large language models; the multimodal\ninstruction tuning datasets for human instruction following. (i) For the model\narchitecture, most existing models introduce an external bridge module to\nconnect vision encoders with language models, which needs an additional\nfeature-alignment pre-training. In this work, we discover that compact\npre-trained vision language models can inherently serve as ``out-of-the-box''\nbridges between vision and language. Based on this, we propose Muffin\nframework, which directly employs pre-trained vision-language models to act as\nproviders of visual signals. (ii) For the multimodal instruction tuning\ndatasets, existing methods omit the complementary relationship between\ndifferent datasets and simply mix datasets from different tasks. Instead, we\npropose UniMM-Chat dataset which explores the complementarities of datasets to\ngenerate 1.1M high-quality and diverse multimodal instructions. We merge\ninformation describing the same image from diverse datasets and transforms it\ninto more knowledge-intensive conversation data. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the Muffin framework and UniMM-Chat dataset.\nMuffin achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of vision-language\ntasks, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art models like LLaVA and\nInstructBLIP.

      "abstract": "Despite the success of large language models (LLMs), the task of theorem\nproving still remains one of the hardest reasoning tasks that is far from being\nfully solved. Prior methods using language models have demonstrated promising\nresults, but they still struggle to prove even middle school level theorems.\nOne common limitation of these methods is that they assume a fixed theorem\nlibrary during the whole theorem proving process. However, as we all know,\ncreating new useful theorems or even new theories is not only helpful but\ncrucial and necessary for advancing mathematics and proving harder and deeper\nresults. In this work, we present LEGO-Prover, which employs a growing skill\nlibrary containing verified lemmas as skills to augment the capability of LLMs\nused in theorem proving. By constructing the proof modularly, LEGO-Prover\nenables LLMs to utilize existing skills retrieved from the library and to\ncreate new skills during the proving process. These skills are further evolved\n(by prompting an LLM) to enrich the library on another scale. Modular and\nreusable skills are constantly added to the library to enable tackling\nincreasingly intricate mathematical problems. Moreover, the learned library\nfurther bridges the gap between human proofs and formal proofs by making it\neasier to impute missing steps. LEGO-Prover advances the state-of-the-art pass\nrate on miniF2F-valid (48.0% to 57.0%) and miniF2F-test (45.5% to 47.1%).\nDuring the proving process, LEGO-Prover also manages to generate over 20,000\nskills (theorems/lemmas) and adds them to the growing library. Our ablation\nstudy indicates that these newly added skills are indeed helpful for proving\ntheorems, resulting in an improvement from a success rate of 47.1% to 50.4%.

      "abstract": "Near the center of the Puppis A SNR a series of nested optically emitting\nrings of high velocity ejecta (known as `the Swirl') were identified several\ndecades ago by Winkler et al. (1989). To date no follow-up observations of\nthese rings have been published, and their physical origin has remained a\nmystery. We present results of integral field spectroscopy of the Swirl using\nthe Wide Field Integral Spectrograph (\\wifes) on the 2.3\\,m telescope at Siding\nSpring Observatory in Australia. The outermost ring exhibits a nitrogen-rich\nspectrum blueshifted to 1350 km/s, with smaller blueshifted rings within the\nfirst exhibiting mostly oxygen-rich spectra moving at 1000 km/s and 750 km/s.\nThe structures are connected by material of intermediate velocity and variable\ncomposition, including sulfur-rich material. The Swirl is turbulent and shock\nexcited, and contains as much as 0.5 M$_{\\odot}$ of metal-rich material. The\nchemical composition and exclusively blueshifted radial velocities of the Swirl\nare consistent with progressively deeper nucleosynthetic layers in a massive\nprogenitor star. We suggest the possibility that the Swirl marks a `funnel'\ncarved into the supernova ejecta by a close, massive binary companion at the\nmoment of explosion.",

      "abstract": "At magic twisted angles, Dirac cones in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) can\nevolve into flat bands, serving as a critical playground for the study of\nstrongly correlated physics. When chiral symmetry is introduced, rigorous\nmathematical proof confirms that the flat bands are locked at zero energy in\nthe entire Moir\\'e Brillouin zone (BZ). Yet, TBG is not the sole platform that\nexhibits this absolute band flatness. Central to this flatness phenomenon are\ntopological nodes and their specific locations in the BZ. In this study,\nconsidering twisted bilayer systems that preserve chiral symmetry, we classify\nvarious ordered topological nodes in base layers and all possible node\nlocations across different BZs. Specifically, we constrain the node locations\nto rotational centers, such as {\\Gamma} and M points, to ensure the interlayer\ncoupling retains equal strength in all directions. Using this classification as\na foundation, we systematically identify the conditions under which Moir\\'e\nflat bands emerge. Additionally, through the extension of holomorphic\nfunctions, we provide proof that flat bands are locked at zero energy, shedding\nlight on the origin of the band flatness. Remarkably, beyond Dirac cones,\nnumerous twisted bilayer nodal platforms can host flat bands with a degeneracy\nnumber of more than two, such as four-fold, six-fold, and eight-fold. This\nmultiplicity of degeneracy in flat bands might unveil more complex and enriched\ncorrelation physics.",

      "abstract": "Available works addressing multi-label classification in a data stream\nenvironment focus on proposing accurate models; however, these models often\nexhibit inefficiency and cannot balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this\nwork, we propose a neural network-based approach that tackles this issue and is\nsuitable for high-dimensional multi-label classification. Our model uses a\nselective concept drift adaptation mechanism that makes it suitable for a\nnon-stationary environment. Additionally, we adapt our model to an environment\nwith missing labels using a simple yet effective imputation strategy and\ndemonstrate that it outperforms a vast majority of the state-of-the-art\nsupervised models. To achieve our purposes, we introduce a weighted binary\nrelevance-based approach named ML-BELS using the Broad Ensemble Learning System\n(BELS) as its base classifier. Instead of a chain of stacked classifiers, our\nmodel employs independent weighted ensembles, with the weights generated by the\npredictions of a BELS classifier. We show that using the weighting strategy on\ndatasets with low label cardinality negatively impacts the accuracy of the\nmodel; with this in mind, we use the label cardinality as a trigger for\napplying the weights. We present an extensive assessment of our model using 11\nstate-of-the-art baselines, five synthetics, and 13 real-world datasets, all\nwith different characteristics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed\napproach ML-BELS is successful in balancing effectiveness and efficiency, and\nis robust to missing labels and concept drift.",

We propose a solution to the field equation using the\nspecific parametrization in the form$H(z) = H_{0} (1+z)^{1+\\alpha+\\beta}\ne^{\\left(\\frac{- \\beta z}{1+z}\\right)}$, which depicts the necessary transition\nof cosmos from decelerating era to the current accelerating scenario.

We discuss\nthe cosmic behavior of many features of the derived model like EoS parameters,\nenergy density, and cosmic pressure. Further, we have also explored the\ncosmological behavior of the quintessence model in Weyl $f(Q,T)$gravity. We\nhave described the cosmic behavior of the model by $\\omega_D-\\omega_D'$\nanalysis. The diagnosis of the model is also performed using state finders and\njerk parameters. In the end, we have discussed the energy conditions for the\nproposed model.

      "abstract": "Nuanced understanding and the generation of detailed descriptive content for\n(bimanual) manipulation actions in videos is important for disciplines such as\nrobotics, human-computer interaction, and video content analysis. This study\ndescribes a novel method, integrating graph based modeling with layered\nhierarchical attention mechanisms, resulting in higher precision and better\ncomprehensiveness of video descriptions. To achieve this, we encode, first, the\nspatio-temporal inter dependencies between objects and actions with scene\ngraphs and we combine this, in a second step, with a novel 3-level architecture\ncreating a hierarchical attention mechanism using Graph Attention Networks\n(GATs). The 3-level GAT architecture allows recognizing local, but also global\ncontextual elements. This way several descriptions with different semantic\ncomplexity can be generated in parallel for the same video clip, enhancing the\ndiscriminative accuracy of action recognition and action description. The\nperformance of our approach is empirically tested using several 2D and 3D\ndatasets. By comparing our method to the state of the art we consistently\nobtain better performance concerning accuracy, precision, and contextual\nrelevance when evaluating action recognition as well as description generation.\nIn a large set of ablation experiments we also assess the role of the different\ncomponents of our model. With our multi-level approach the system obtains\ndifferent semantic description depths, often observed in descriptions made by\ndifferent people, too. Furthermore, better insight into bimanual hand-object\ninteractions as achieved by our model may portend advancements in the field of\nrobotics, enabling the emulation of intricate human actions with heightened\nprecision.",

Statistical techniques\nbased on machine learning offer faster inference, but although recent\napproaches demonstrate overall improved accuracy, they still perform\nsignificantly worse on user-defined types than on the most common built-in\ntypes. Limiting their real-world usefulness even more, they rarely integrate\nwith user-facing applications. We propose CodeTIDAL5, a Transformer-based model\ntrained to reliably predict type annotations. For effective result retrieval\nand re-integration, we extract usage slices from a program's code property\ngraph. Comparing our approach against recent neural type inference systems, our\nmodel outperforms the current state-of-the-art by 7.85% on the\nManyTypes4TypeScript benchmark, achieving 71.27% accuracy overall. Furthermore,\nwe present JoernTI, an integration of our approach into Joern, an open source\nstatic analysis tool, and demonstrate that the analysis benefits from the\nadditional type information. As our model allows for fast inference times even\non commodity CPUs, making our system available through Joern leads to high\naccessibility and facilitates security research.",

We observe that this mixes the evaluation of two separate components: the\nnon-linear architecture, and the parameters optimization method. In particular,\nthe non-linear model is often optimized, whereas the reference KF model is not.\nWe argue that both should be optimized similarly, and to that end present the\nOptimized KF (OKF). We demonstrate that the KF may become competitive to neural\nmodels - if optimized using OKF. This implies that experimental conclusions of\ncertain previous studies were derived from a flawed process. The advantage of\nOKF over the standard KF is further studied theoretically and empirically, in a\nvariety of problems. Conveniently, OKF can replace the KF in real-world systems\nby merely updating the parameters.",

The I3PE framework comprises four steps:\n1) intra-image patch exchange method is based on an object-based image analysis\nmethod and adaptive clustering algorithm, which generates pseudo-bi-temporal\nimage pairs and corresponding change labels from single-temporal images by\nexchanging patches within the image; 2) inter-image patch exchange method can\ngenerate more types of land-cover changes by exchanging patches between images;\n3) a simulation pipeline consisting of several image enhancement methods is\nproposed to simulate the radiometric difference between pre- and post-event\nimages caused by different imaging conditions in real situations; 4)\nself-supervised learning based on pseudo-labels is applied to further improve\nthe performance of the change detectors in both unsupervised and\nsemi-supervised cases.

Therefore, a validated vehicle model is\nrequired that accurately and efficiently predicts the states of the vehicle.\nUnlike forward driving, open-loop validation methods can not be used for\nreverse driving of articulated vehicles due to their unstable dynamics.

The algorithm\nthat raises an alarm as soon as the CuSum statistic that corresponds to one of\nthe post-change alternatives exceeds a certain threshold is studied. When the\ndata are generated over independent channels and the change can occur in only\none of them, its worst-case with respect to the change point conditional\nprobability of misidentification, given that there was not a false alarm, is\nshown to decay exponentially fast in the threshold. As a corollary, in this\nsetup, this algorithm is shown to asymptotically minimize Lorden's detection\ndelay criterion, simultaneously for every possible post-change distribution,\nwithin the class of schemes that satisfy prescribed bounds on the false alarm\nrate and the worst-case conditional probability of misidentification, as the\nformer goes to zero sufficiently faster than the latter.

Our results demonstrate the excellent performance of RPA-QEDFT in the\nultrastrong coupling regime, and for any number $N$ of Dicke molecules in the\ncavity. We study in detail the scaling of xc energy with $N$, and emphasize the\nimportance for the ground state QEDFT of collective effects in the interaction\nof molecules with cavity photons. Finally, we discuss implications of our\nresults for realistic systems.",

One of the challenges for graph neural networks\nis that of defining the propagation strategy. For instance, the choices of\npropagation steps are often specialized to a single graph and are not\npersonalized to different nodes. To compensate for this, in this paper, we\npresent learning to propagate, a general learning framework that not only\nlearns the GNN parameters for prediction but more importantly, can explicitly\nlearn the interpretable and personalized propagate strategies for different\nnodes and various types of graphs. We introduce the optimal propagation steps\nas latent variables to help find the maximum-likelihood estimation of the GNN\nparameters in a variational Expectation-Maximization (VEM) framework.

Although\ncurrent deep learning methods have made significant progress in detecting\ncamouflaged objects, many of them heavily rely on additional prior information.\nHowever, acquiring such additional prior information is both expensive and\nimpractical in real-world scenarios. Therefore, there is a need to develop a\nnetwork for camouflage object detection that does not depend on additional\npriors. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive feature aggregation method\nthat effectively combines multi-layer feature information to generate guidance\ninformation. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on edge or ranking\npriors, our method directly leverages information extracted from image features\nto guide model training.

      "abstract": "As a fundamental task in graph data management, maximal clique enumeration\n(MCE) has attracted extensive attention from both academic and industrial\ncommunities due to its wide range of applications. However, MCE is very\nchallenging as the number of maximal cliques may grow exponentially with the\nnumber of vertices. The state-of-the-art methods adopt a recursive paradigm to\nenumerate maximal cliques exhaustively, suffering from a large amount of\nredundant computation. In this paper, we propose a novel reduction-based\nframework for MCE, namely RMCE, that aims to reduce the search space and\nminimize unnecessary computations. The proposed framework RMCE incorporates\nthree kinds of powerful reduction techniques including global reduction,\ndynamic reduction, and maximality check reduction. Global and dynamic reduction\ntechniques effectively reduce the size of the input graph and dynamically\nconstruct subgraphs during the recursive subtasks, respectively. The maximality\ncheck reduction minimizes the computation for ensuring maximality by utilizing\nneighborhood dominance between visited vertices. Extensive experiments on 18\nreal graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. It achieves\nremarkable speedups up to 44.7x compared to existing approaches.",

      "abstract": "The EPC GEN 2 communication protocol for Ultra-high frequency Radio Frequency\nIdentification (RFID) has offered a promising avenue for advancing the\nintelligence of transportation infrastructure. With the capability of linking\nvehicles to RFID readers to crowdsource information from RFID tags on road\ninfrastructures, the RF-enhanced road infrastructure (REI) can potentially\ntransform data acquisition for urban transportation. Despite its potential, the\nbroader adoption of RFID technologies in building intelligent roads has been\nlimited by a deficiency in understanding how the GEN 2 protocol impacts system\nperformance under different transportation settings. This paper fills this\nknowledge gap by presenting the system architecture and detailing the design\nchallenges associated with REI. Comprehensive real-world experiments are\nconducted to assess REI's effectiveness across various urban contexts. The\nresults yield crucial insights into the optimal design of on-vehicle RFID\nreaders and on-road RFID tags, considering the constraints imposed by vehicle\ndynamics, road geometries, and tag placements. With the optimized designs of\nencoding schemes for reader-tag communication and on-vehicle antennas, REI is\nable to fulfill the requirements of traffic sign inventory management and\nenvironmental monitoring while falling short of catering to the demand for\nhigh-speed navigation. In particular, the Miller 2 encoding scheme strikes the\nbest balance between reading performance (e.g., throughput) and noise tolerance\nfor the multipath effect. Additionally, we show that the on-vehicle antenna\nshould be oriented to maximize the available time for reading on-road tags,\nalthough it may reduce the received power by the tags in the forward link.",

      "abstract": "Context: Machine Learning (ML) has become widely adopted as a component in\nmany modern software applications. Due to the large volumes of data available,\norganizations want to increasingly leverage their data to extract meaningful\ninsights and enhance business profitability. ML components enable predictive\ncapabilities, anomaly detection, recommendation, accurate image and text\nprocessing, and informed decision-making. However, developing systems with ML\ncomponents is not trivial; it requires time, effort, knowledge, and expertise\nin ML, data processing, and software engineering. There have been several\nstudies on the use of model-driven engineering (MDE) techniques to address\nthese challenges when developing traditional software and cyber-physical\nsystems. Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying MDE for\nsystems with ML components. Objective: The goal of this study is to further\nexplore the promising intersection of MDE with ML (MDE4ML) through a systematic\nliterature review (SLR). Through this SLR, we wanted to analyze existing\nstudies, including their motivations, MDE solutions, evaluation techniques, key\nbenefits and limitations. Results: We analyzed selected studies with respect to\nseveral areas of interest and identified the following: 1) the key motivations\nbehind using MDE4ML; 2) a variety of MDE solutions applied, such as modeling\nlanguages, model transformations, tool support, targeted ML aspects,\ncontributions and more; 3) the evaluation techniques and metrics used; and 4)\nthe limitations and directions for future work. We also discuss the gaps in\nexisting literature and provide recommendations for future research.\nConclusion: This SLR highlights current trends, gaps and future research\ndirections in the field of MDE4ML, benefiting both researchers and\npractitioners",

      "abstract": "Clinical natural language processing requires methods that can address\ndomain-specific challenges, such as complex medical terminology and clinical\ncontexts. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in this\ndomain. Yet, their direct deployment can lead to privacy issues and are\nconstrained by resources. To address this challenge, we delve into synthetic\nclinical text generation using LLMs for clinical NLP tasks. We propose an\ninnovative, resource-efficient approach, ClinGen, which infuses knowledge into\nthe process. Our model involves clinical knowledge extraction and\ncontext-informed LLM prompting. Both clinical topics and writing styles are\ndrawn from external domain-specific knowledge graphs and LLMs to guide data\ngeneration. Our extensive empirical study across 7 clinical NLP tasks and 16\ndatasets reveals that ClinGen consistently enhances performance across various\ntasks, effectively aligning the distribution of real datasets and significantly\nenriching the diversity of generated training instances.

      "abstract": "Instruction tuning (IT) achieves impressive zero-shot generalization results\nby training large language models (LLMs) on a massive amount of diverse tasks\nwith instructions. However, how to select new tasks to improve the performance\nand generalizability of IT models remains an open question. Training on all\nexisting tasks is impractical due to prohibiting computation requirements, and\nrandomly selecting tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. In this work, we\npropose active instruction tuning based on prompt uncertainty, a novel\nframework to identify informative tasks, and then actively tune the models on\nthe selected tasks. We represent the informativeness of new tasks with the\ndisagreement of the current model outputs over perturbed prompts. Our\nexperiments on NIV2 and Self-Instruct datasets demonstrate that our method\nconsistently outperforms other baseline strategies for task selection,\nachieving better out-of-distribution generalization with fewer training tasks.\nAdditionally, we introduce a task map that categorizes and diagnoses tasks\nbased on prompt uncertainty and prediction probability. We discover that\ntraining on ambiguous (prompt-uncertain) tasks improves generalization while\ntraining on difficult (prompt-certain and low-probability) tasks offers no\nbenefit, underscoring the importance of task selection for instruction tuning.",

      "abstract": "We revisit the fundamental question of simple-versus-simple hypothesis\ntesting with an eye towards computational complexity, as the statistically\noptimal likelihood ratio test is often computationally intractable in\nhigh-dimensional settings. In the classical spiked Wigner model (with a general\ni.i.d. spike prior) we show that an existing test based on linear spectral\nstatistics achieves the best possible tradeoff curve between type I and type II\nerror rates among all computationally efficient tests, even though there are\nexponential-time tests that do better. This result is conditional on an\nappropriate complexity-theoretic conjecture, namely a natural strengthening of\nthe well-established low-degree conjecture. Our result shows that the spectrum\nis a sufficient statistic for computationally bounded tests (but not for all\ntests).\n  To our knowledge, our approach gives the first tool for reasoning about the\nprecise asymptotic testing error achievable with efficient computation. The\nmain ingredients required for our hardness result are a sharp bound on the norm\nof the low-degree likelihood ratio along with (counterintuitively) a positive\nresult on achievability of testing. This strategy appears to be new even in the\nsetting of unbounded computation, in which case it gives an alternate way to\nanalyze the fundamental statistical limits of testing.",

      "abstract": "As the global deployment of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology\nintensifies in the fight against climate change, it becomes increasingly\nimperative to establish robust monitoring and detection mechanisms for\npotential underground CO2 leakage, particularly through pre-existing or induced\nfaults in the storage reservoir's seals. While techniques such as history\nmatching and time-lapse seismic monitoring of CO2 storage have been used\nsuccessfully in tracking the evolution of CO2 plumes in the subsurface, these\nmethods lack principled approaches to characterize uncertainties related to the\nCO2 plumes' behavior. Inclusion of systematic assessment of uncertainties is\nessential for risk mitigation for the following reasons: (i) CO2 plume-induced\nchanges are small and seismic data is noisy; (ii) changes between regular and\nirregular (e.g., caused by leakage) flow patterns are small; and (iii) the\nreservoir properties that control the flow are strongly heterogeneous and\ntypically only available as distributions. To arrive at a formulation capable\nof inferring flow patterns for regular and irregular flow from well and seismic\ndata, the performance of conditional normalizing flow will be analyzed on a\nseries of carefully designed numerical experiments. While the inferences\npresented are preliminary in the context of an early CO2 leakage detection\nsystem, the results do indicate that inferences with conditional normalizing\nflows can produce high-fidelity estimates for CO2 plumes with or without\nleakage. We are also confident that the inferred uncertainty is reasonable\nbecause it correlates well with the observed errors. This uncertainty stems\nfrom noise in the seismic data and from the lack of precise knowledge of the\nreservoir's fluid flow properties.",

      "abstract": "Infrared and visible image fusion aims to extract complementary features to\nsynthesize a single fused image. Many methods employ convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) to extract local features due to its translation invariance and\nlocality. However, CNNs fail to consider the image's non-local self-similarity\n(NLss), though it can expand the receptive field by pooling operations, it\nstill inevitably leads to information loss. In addition, the transformer\nstructure extracts long-range dependence by considering the correlativity among\nall image patches, leading to information redundancy of such transformer-based\nmethods. However, graph representation is more flexible than grid (CNN) or\nsequence (transformer structure) representation to address irregular objects,\nand graph can also construct the relationships among the spatially repeatable\ndetails or texture with far-space distance. Therefore, to address the above\nissues, it is significant to convert images into the graph space and thus adopt\ngraph convolutional networks (GCNs) to extract NLss. This is because the graph\ncan provide a fine structure to aggregate features and propagate information\nacross the nearest vertices without introducing redundant information.\nConcretely, we implement a cascaded NLss extraction pattern to extract NLss of\nintra- and inter-modal by exploring interactions of different image pixels in\nintra- and inter-image positional distance. We commence by preforming GCNs on\neach intra-modal to aggregate features and propagate information to extract\nindependent intra-modal NLss. Then, GCNs are performed on the concatenate\nintra-modal NLss features of infrared and visible images, which can explore the\ncross-domain NLss of inter-modal to reconstruct the fused image. Ablation\nstudies and extensive experiments illustrates the effectiveness and superiority\nof the proposed method on three datasets.",

      "title": "Semantic Representation Learning of Scientific Literature based on\n  Adaptive Feature and Graph Neural Network",
      "abstract": "Because most of the scientific literature data is unmarked, it makes semantic\nrepresentation learning based on unsupervised graph become crucial. At the same\ntime, in order to enrich the features of scientific literature, a learning\nmethod of semantic representation of scientific literature based on adaptive\nfeatures and graph neural network is proposed. By introducing the adaptive\nfeature method, the features of scientific literature are considered globally\nand locally. The graph attention mechanism is used to sum the features of\nscientific literature with citation relationship, and give each scientific\nliterature different feature weights, so as to better express the correlation\nbetween the features of different scientific literature. In addition, an\nunsupervised graph neural network semantic representation learning method is\nproposed. By comparing the mutual information between the positive and negative\nlocal semantic representation of scientific literature and the global graph\nsemantic representation in the potential space, the graph neural network can\ncapture the local and global information, thus improving the learning ability\nof the semantic representation of scientific literature. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed learning method of semantic representation of\nscientific literature based on adaptive feature and graph neural network is\ncompetitive on the basis of scientific literature classification, and has\nachieved good results.",

      "abstract": "Text-to-video retrieval (TVR) aims to find the most relevant video in a large\nvideo gallery given a query text. The intricate and abundant context of the\nvideo challenges the performance and efficiency of TVR. To handle the\nserialized video contexts, existing methods typically select a subset of frames\nwithin a video to represent the video content for TVR. How to select the most\nrepresentative frames is a crucial issue, whereby the selected frames are\nrequired to not only retain the semantic information of the video but also\npromote retrieval efficiency by excluding temporally redundant frames. In this\npaper, we make the first empirical study of frame selection for TVR. We\nsystemically classify existing frame selection methods into text-free and\ntext-guided ones, under which we detailedly analyze six different frame\nselections in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Among them, two frame\nselections are first developed in this paper. According to the comprehensive\nanalysis on multiple TVR benchmarks, we empirically conclude that the TVR with\nproper frame selections can significantly improve the retrieval efficiency\nwithout sacrificing the retrieval performance.",

      "abstract": "The steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamic framework is used to\ninvestigate the effectiveness of multi-chain\npolyethyleneimine-methylenephosphonic acid in sequestering rare-earth ions\n(Eu$^{+3}$) from aqueous solutions. The framework applies a thermodynamic\nequation of motion to a discrete energy eigenstructure to model the binding\nkinetics of europium ions to reactive sites of the polymer chains. The energy\neigenstructure is generated using a non-Markovian Monte Carlo model that\nestimates energy level degeneracies. The equation of motion is used to\ndetermine the occupation probability of each energy level, describing the\nunique path through thermodynamic state space by which the polymer system\nsequesters rare-earth ions from solution. A second Monte Carlo simulation is\nconducted to relate the kinetic path in state space to physical descriptors\nassociated with the polymer, including the radius of gyration, tortuosity, and\nEu-neighbor distribution functions. These descriptors are used to visualize the\nevolution of the polymer during the sequestration process. The fraction of\nsequestered Eu$^{+3}$ ions depends upon the total energy of the system, with\nlower energy resulting in higher sequestration. The kinetics of the overall\nsequestration are dependent on the steepest-entropy-ascent principle used by\nthe equation of motion to generate a unique kinetic path from an initial\nnon-equilibrium state.",

      "abstract": "One precondition of effective oral communication is that words should be\npronounced clearly, especially for non-native speakers. Word stress is the key\nto clear and correct English, and misplacement of syllable stress may lead to\nmisunderstandings. Thus, knowing the stress level is important for English\nspeakers and learners. This paper presents a self-attention model to identify\nthe stress level for each syllable of spoken English. Various prosodic and\ncategorical features, including the pitch level, intensity, duration and type\nof the syllable and its nuclei (the vowel of the syllable), are explored. These\nfeatures are input to the self-attention model, and syllable-level stresses are\npredicted. The simplest model yields an accuracy of over 88% and 93% on\ndifferent datasets, while more advanced models provide higher accuracy. Our\nstudy suggests that the self-attention model can be promising in stress-level\ndetection. These models could be applied to various scenarios, such as online\nmeetings and English learning.",

      "abstract": "The unexpected discovery of hot Jupiters challenged the classical theory of\nplanet formation inspired by our solar system. Until now, the origin and\nevolution of hot Jupiters are still uncertain. Determining their age\ndistribution and temporal evolution can provide more clues into the mechanism\nof their formation and subsequent evolution. Using a sample of 383 giant\nplanets around Sun-like stars collected from the kinematic catalogs of the\nPlanets Across Space and Time (PAST) project, we find that hot Jupiters are\npreferentially hosted by relatively younger stars in the Galactic thin disk. We\nsubsequently find that the frequency of hot Jupiters declines with age. In\ncontrast, the frequency of warm/cold Jupiters shows no significant dependence\non age. Such a trend is expected from the tidal evolution of hot Jupiters'\norbits, and our result offers supporting evidence using a large sample. We also\nperform a joint analysis on the planet frequencies in the stellar\nage-metallicity plane. The result suggests that the frequencies of hot Jupiters\nand warm/cold Jupiters, after removing the age dependence are both correlated\nwith stellar metallicities. Moreover, we show that the above correlations can\nexplain the bulk of the discrepancy in hot Jupiter frequencies inferred from\nthe transit and radial velocity (RV) surveys, given that RV targets tend to be\nmore metal-rich and younger than transits.",

Therefore, over the past one and a half centuries, many partial\ndifferential equations based on a few macroscopic variables are proposed.\nHowever, they not only have complicated forms, but also cannot make\nsatisfactory prediction when the Knudsen number is large. Here, we propose a\nnon-localized spatial-temporal (NiST) constitutive relation for rarefied gas\ndynamics, where the stress/heat flux at time $t$ and position $\\bm x$ is\ndetermined by the velocity/temperature gradient in the nearby spatial-temporal\ncoordinates, via convolution operators. By using the solutions of the Boltzmann\nequation for the Couette/Fourier flow and the spontaneous Rayleigh-Brillouin\nscattering, we extract the universal parameters of non-locality as functions of\nthe spatial and temporal Knudsen numbers. Further tests in the sound\npropagation in rarefied gas show that the NiST constitutive relation can\npredict the rarefied gas flow over a wide range of Knudsen number.",

The regular and the black hole solutions are smoothly\nconnected in the small horizon limit.

Third, as the energy function of the canonical ensemble\nis defined as a series, the problem transforms into finding solutions to the\nequations of analytic series for the coefficients in the energy function.\nNaturally, through the use of truncated polynomial series and by demonstrating\nthe convergence of partial sums of the energy function, we ensure the\nefficiency of approximation with a finite number of data points.

      "abstract": "Topic modeling has emerged as a valuable tool for discovering patterns and\ntopics within large collections of documents. However, when cross-analysis\ninvolves multiple parties, data privacy becomes a critical concern. Federated\ntopic modeling has been developed to address this issue, allowing multiple\nparties to jointly train models while protecting pri-vacy. However, there are\ncommunication and performance challenges in the federated sce-nario. In order\nto solve the above problems, this paper proposes a method to establish a\nfederated topic model while ensuring the privacy of each node, and use neural\nnetwork model pruning to accelerate the model, where the client periodically\nsends the model neu-ron cumulative gradients and model weights to the server,\nand the server prunes the model. To address different requirements, two\ndifferent methods are proposed to determine the model pruning rate. The first\nmethod involves slow pruning throughout the entire model training process,\nwhich has limited acceleration effect on the model training process, but can\nensure that the pruned model achieves higher accuracy. This can significantly\nreduce the model inference time during the inference process. The second\nstrategy is to quickly reach the target pruning rate in the early stage of\nmodel training in order to accelerate the model training speed, and then\ncontinue to train the model with a smaller model size after reaching the target\npruning rate. This approach may lose more useful information but can complete\nthe model training faster. Experimental results show that the federated topic\nmodel pruning based on the variational autoencoder proposed in this paper can\ngreatly accelerate the model training speed while ensuring the model's\nperformance.",

The collisions are classified by the\nradial motion of the constituent particles at the moment of collision, with\neach class exhibiting a distinct near-horizon behavior. Divergence in the CM\nenergy is sourced by the difference in the rate at which the collision radius\napproaches the horizon and the rate at which a particle's angular momentum is\ntuned to a critical value set by the superradiant bound. To produce a high\nenergy collision around a near-extremal BH, at least one particle must approach\ncriticality slower than the collision radius approaches the horizon. When both\nparticles are ingoing or outgoing, it is additionally required that the\nparticles approach criticality at different rates.

      "abstract": "With the proliferation of social media, accurate detection of hate speech has\nbecome critical to ensure safety online. To combat nuanced forms of hate\nspeech, it is important to identify and thoroughly explain hate speech to help\nusers understand its harmful effects.

However, we find significant reasoning gaps in\nthe existing annotations schemes, which may hinder the supervision of detection\nmodels.

Experiments on SBIC and Implicit Hate\nbenchmarks show that our method, using model-generated data, consistently\noutperforms baselines, using existing free-text human annotations.

      "abstract": "Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) has been traditionally used to ensure\ncomplete tolerance to a single fault or a faulty processing unit, where the\nprocessing unit may be a circuit or a system. However, TMR incurs more than\n200% overhead in terms of area and power compared to a single processing unit.\nHence, alternative redundancy approaches were proposed in the literature to\nmitigate the design overheads associated with TMR, but they provide only\npartial or moderate fault tolerance. This research presents a new\nfault-tolerant design approach based on approximate computing called FAC that\nhas the same fault tolerance as TMR and achieves significant reductions in the\ndesign metrics for physical implementation. FAC is suited for a plethora of\nerror-tolerant applications. Here, the performance of TMR and FAC has been\nevaluated for a digital image processing application. The image processing\nresults obtained confirm the usefulness of FAC. When an example processing unit\nwas implemented using a 28-nm CMOS technology, FAC achieved a 15.3% reduction\nin delay, a 19.5% reduction in area, and a 24.7% reduction in power compared to\nTMR.",

      "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) encompasses a spectrum of cardiovascular\nstructural abnormalities, often requiring customized treatment plans for\nindividual patients. Computational modeling and analysis of these unique\ncardiac anatomies can improve diagnosis and treatment planning and may\nultimately lead to improved outcomes. Deep learning (DL) methods have\ndemonstrated the potential to enable efficient treatment planning by automating\ncardiac segmentation and mesh construction for patients with normal cardiac\nanatomies. However, CHDs are often rare, making it challenging to acquire\nsufficiently large patient cohorts for training such DL models. Generative\nmodeling of cardiac anatomies has the potential to fill this gap via the\ngeneration of virtual cohorts; however, prior approaches were largely designed\nfor normal anatomies and cannot readily capture the significant topological\nvariations seen in CHD patients. Therefore, we propose a type- and\nshape-disentangled generative approach suitable to capture the wide spectrum of\ncardiac anatomies observed in different CHD types and synthesize differently\nshaped cardiac anatomies that preserve the unique topology for specific CHD\ntypes. Our DL approach represents generic whole heart anatomies with CHD\ntype-specific abnormalities implicitly using signed distance fields (SDF) based\non CHD type diagnosis, which conveniently captures divergent anatomical\nvariations across different types and represents meaningful intermediate CHD\nstates. To capture the shape-specific variations, we then learn invertible\ndeformations to morph the learned CHD type-specific anatomies and reconstruct\npatient-specific shapes. Our approach has the potential to augment the\nimage-segmentation pairs for rarer CHD types for cardiac segmentation and\ngenerate cohorts of CHD cardiac meshes for computational simulation.",

      "abstract": "A Federated Learning (FL) system typically consists of two core processing\nentities: the federation controller and the learners. The controller is\nresponsible for managing the execution of FL workflows across learners and the\nlearners for training and evaluating federated models over their private\ndatasets. While executing an FL workflow, the FL system has no control over the\ncomputational resources or data of the participating learners. Still, it is\nresponsible for other operations, such as model aggregation, task dispatching,\nand scheduling. These computationally heavy operations generally need to be\nhandled by the federation controller. Even though many FL systems have been\nrecently proposed to facilitate the development of FL workflows, most of these\nsystems overlook the scalability of the controller. To meet this need, we\ndesigned and developed a novel FL system called MetisFL, where the federation\ncontroller is the first-class citizen. MetisFL re-engineers all the operations\nconducted by the federation controller to accelerate the training of\nlarge-scale FL workflows. By quantitatively comparing MetisFL against other\nstate-of-the-art FL systems, we empirically demonstrate that MetisFL leads to a\n10-fold wall-clock time execution boost across a wide range of challenging FL\nworkflows with increasing model sizes and federation sites.",

The DKL structure results in a flat valence\nband with high effective mass and a conduction band with small effective mass\ncomes from Dirac electrons. These distinctive band edges lead to a significant\ndisparity in carrier mobilities, with electron mobility being four orders of\nmagnitude higher than that of holes. The presence of flat band in DKL-nitrogene\ncan be further discerned through the enhanced optical absorption and correlated\neffects as exemplified by hole-induced ferromagnetism. Interestingly,\nDKL-nitrogene exhibits inherent second-order topological states, confirmed by a\nnon-trivial second Stiefel-Whitney number and the presence of 1D floating edge\nstates and 0D corner states within the bulk band gap. Additionally, the robust\nN-N bonds and the lattice's bending structure ensure thermodynamic stability\nand mechanical stiffness. These attributes make it exceptionally stable for\npotential applications in nano-devices.",

However,\ndiscovering promising MOF sorbents for DAC is challenging because of the vast\nchemical space to explore and the need to understand materials as functions of\nhumidity and temperature. We explore a computational approach benefiting from\nrecent innovations in machine learning (ML) and present a dataset named Open\nDAC 2023 (ODAC23) consisting of more than 38M density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations on more than 8,400 MOF materials containing adsorbed $CO_2$ and/or\n$H_2O$. ODAC23 is by far the largest dataset of MOF adsorption calculations at\nthe DFT level of accuracy currently available. In addition to probing\nproperties of adsorbed molecules, the dataset is a rich source of information\non structural relaxation of MOFs, which will be useful in many contexts beyond\nspecific applications for DAC. A large number of MOFs with promising properties\nfor DAC are identified directly in ODAC23. We also trained state-of-the-art ML\nmodels on this dataset to approximate calculations at the DFT level.

The server's task is to track a function\nof all items received thus far continuously, with minimum communication cost.\nFor count tracking, it is known that there is a $\\sqrt{k}$ gap in communication\nbetween deterministic and randomized algorithms. However, existing randomized\nalgorithms assume an \"oblivious adversary\" who constructs the entire input\nstreams before the algorithm starts. Here we consider adaptive adversaries who\ncan choose new items based on previous answers from the algorithm.\nDeterministic algorithms are trivially robust to adaptive adversaries, while\nrandomized ones may not. Therefore, we investigate whether the $\\sqrt{k}$\nadvantage of randomized algorithms is from randomness itself or the oblivious\nadversary assumption. We provide an affirmative answer to this question by\ngiving a robust algorithm with optimal communication. Existing robustification\ntechniques do not yield optimal bounds due to the inherent challenges of the\ndistributed nature of the problem. To address this, we extend the differential\nprivacy framework by introducing \"partial differential privacy\" and proving a\nnew generalization theorem. This theorem may have broader applications beyond\nrobust count tracking, making it of independent interest.",

      "abstract": "Leveraging the generative ability of image diffusion models offers great\npotential for zero-shot video-to-video translation. The key lies in how to\nmaintain temporal consistency across generated video frames by image diffusion\nmodels. Previous methods typically adopt cross-frame attention, \\emph{i.e.,}\nsharing the \\textit{key} and \\textit{value} tokens across attentions of\ndifferent frames, to encourage the temporal consistency. However, in those\nworks, temporal inconsistency issue may not be thoroughly solved, rendering the\nfidelity of generated videos limited.%The current state of the art cross-frame\nattention method aims at maintaining fine-grained visual details across frames,\nbut it is still challenged by the temporal coherence problem. In this paper, we\nfind the bottleneck lies in the unconstrained query tokens and propose a new\nzero-shot video-to-video translation framework, named \\textit{LatentWarp}. Our\napproach is simple: to constrain the query tokens to be temporally consistent,\nwe further incorporate a warping operation in the latent space to constrain the\nquery tokens. Specifically, based on the optical flow obtained from the\noriginal video, we warp the generated latent features of last frame to align\nwith the current frame during the denoising process. As a result, the\ncorresponding regions across the adjacent frames can share closely-related\nquery tokens and attention outputs, which can further improve latent-level\nconsistency to enhance visual temporal coherence of generated videos. Extensive\nexperiment results demonstrate the superiority of \\textit{LatentWarp} in\nachieving video-to-video translation with temporal coherence.",

      "abstract": "Centralized training is widely utilized in the field of multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) to assure the stability of training process. Once\na joint policy is obtained, it is critical to design a value function\nfactorization method to extract optimal decentralized policies for the agents,\nwhich needs to satisfy the individual-global-max (IGM) principle. While\nimposing additional limitations on the IGM function class can help to meet the\nrequirement, it comes at the cost of restricting its application to more\ncomplex multi-agent environments. In this paper, we propose QFree, a universal\nvalue function factorization method for MARL. We start by developing\nmathematical equivalent conditions of the IGM principle based on the advantage\nfunction, which ensures that the principle holds without any compromise,\nremoving the conservatism of conventional methods. We then establish a more\nexpressive mixing network architecture that can fulfill the equivalent\nfactorization. In particular, the novel loss function is developed by\nconsidering the equivalent conditions as regularization term during policy\nevaluation in the MARL algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod is verified in a nonmonotonic matrix game scenario. Moreover, we show\nthat QFree achieves the state-of-the-art performance in a general-purpose\ncomplex MARL benchmark environment, Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC).",

For this purpose, the derivation of the 2-dimensional\n(2D) Fresnel reflection coefficients on a graphene sheet is presented in terms\nof the transverse and longitudinal dielectric permittivities of graphene with\ndue account of the spatial dispersion. The explicit expressions for both\ndielectric permittivities as the functions of the 2D wave vector, frequency,\nand temperature are written along the real frequency axis in the regions of\npropagating and evanescent waves and at the pure imaginary Matsubara\nfrequencies using the polarization tensor of graphene.

      "abstract": "In this paper, the advancements in structured light beams recognition using\nspeckle-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been presented. Speckle\nfields, generated by the interference of multiple wavefronts diffracted and\nscattered through a diffuser, project a random distribution. The generated\nrandom distribution of phase and intensity correlates to the structured light\nbeam of the corresponding speckle field. This unique distribution of phase and\nintensity offers an additional dimension for recognizing the encoded\ninformation in structured light. The CNNs are well-suited for harnessing this\nunique ability to recognize the speckle field by learning hidden patterns\nwithin data. One notable advantage of speckle-based recognition is their\nability to identify structured light beams from a small portion of the speckle\nfield, even in high-noise environments. The diffractive nature of the speckle\nfield enables off-axis recognition, showcasing its capability in information\nbroadcasting employing structured light beams. This is a significant departure\nfrom direct-mode detection-based models to alignment-free speckle-based\ndetection models, which are no longer constrained by the directionality of\nlaser beams.",

      "abstract": "Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition (IDRR), which infers discourse\nrelations without the help of explicit connectives, is still a crucial and\nchallenging task for discourse parsing. Recent works tend to exploit the\nhierarchical structure information from the annotated senses, which demonstrate\nenhanced discourse relation representations can be obtained by integrating\nsense hierarchy. Nevertheless, the performance and robustness for IDRR are\nsignificantly constrained by the availability of annotated data. Fortunately,\nthere is a wealth of unannotated utterances with explicit connectives, that can\nbe utilized to acquire enriched discourse relation features. In light of such\nmotivation, we propose a Prompt-based Logical Semantics Enhancement (PLSE)\nmethod for IDRR. Essentially, our method seamlessly injects knowledge relevant\nto discourse relation into pre-trained language models through prompt-based\nconnective prediction. Furthermore, considering the prompt-based connective\nprediction exhibits local dependencies due to the deficiency of masked language\nmodel (MLM) in capturing global semantics, we design a novel self-supervised\nlearning objective based on mutual information maximization to derive enhanced\nrepresentations of logical semantics for IDRR. Experimental results on PDTB 2.0\nand CoNLL16 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding and\nconsistent performance against the current state-of-the-art models.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease is a global health challenge that requires early and\naccurate detection to improve patient outcomes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI) holds significant diagnostic potential, but its effective analysis\nremains a formidable task. This study introduces a groundbreaking decentralized\nexpert system that cleverly combines blockchain technology with Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) to integrate robust anomaly detection for patient-submitted\ndata.\n  Traditional diagnostic methods often lead to delayed and imprecise\npredictions, especially in the early stages of the disease. Centralized data\nrepositories struggle to manage the immense volumes of MRI data, and persistent\nprivacy concerns hinder collaborative efforts. Our innovative solution\nharnesses decentralization to protect data integrity and patient privacy,\nfacilitated by blockchain technology. It not only emphasizes AI-driven MRI\nanalysis but also incorporates a sophisticated data anomaly detection\narchitecture. These mechanisms scrutinize patient-contributed data for various\nissues, including data quality problems and atypical findings within MRI\nimages.\n  Conducting an exhaustive check of MRI image correctness and quality directly\non the blockchain is impractical due to computational complexity and cost\nconstraints. Typically, such checks are performed off-chain, and the blockchain\nsecurely records the results. This comprehensive approach empowers our\ndecentralized app to provide more precise early-stage Alzheimer's Disease\npredictions.

      "abstract": "The accuracy of stellar distances inferred purely from parallaxes degrades\nrapidly with distance. Proper motion measurements, when combined with some idea\nof typical velocities, provide independent information on stellar distances.\nHere I build a direction- and distance-dependent model of the distribution of\nstellar velocities in the Galaxy, then use this together with parallaxes and\nproper motions to infer kinegeometric distances and transverse velocities for\nstars in Gaia DR3. Using noisy simulations I assess the performance of the\nmethod and compare its accuracy to purely parallax-based (geometric) distances.\nOver the whole Gaia catalogue, kinegeometric distances are on average 1.25\ntimes more accurate than geometric ones. This average masks a large variation\nin the relative performance, however. Kinegeometric distances are considerably\nbetter than geometric ones beyond several kpc, for example. On average,\nkinegeometric distances can be measured to an accuracy of 19% and velocities\n(sqrt[vra^2 + vdec^2]) to 16 km/s (median absolute deviations). In Gaia DR3,\nkinegeometric distances are smaller than geometric ones on average for distant\nstars, but the pattern is more complex in the bulge and disk. With the much\nmore accurate proper motions expected in Gaia DR5, a further improvement in the\ndistance accuracy by a factor of (only) 1.35 on average is predicted (with\nkinegeometric distances still 1.25 times more accurate than geometric ones).\nThe improvement from proper motions is limited by the width of the velocity\nprior, in a way that the improvement from better parallaxes is not limited by\nthe width of the distance prior.",

      "title": "NeuralGF: Unsupervised Point Normal Estimation by Learning Neural\n  Gradient Function",
      "abstract": "Normal estimation for 3D point clouds is a fundamental task in 3D geometry\nprocessing. The state-of-the-art methods rely on priors of fitting local\nsurfaces learned from normal supervision. However, normal supervision in\nbenchmarks comes from synthetic shapes and is usually not available from real\nscans, thereby limiting the learned priors of these methods. In addition,\nnormal orientation consistency across shapes remains difficult to achieve\nwithout a separate post-processing procedure. To resolve these issues, we\npropose a novel method for estimating oriented normals directly from point\nclouds without using ground truth normals as supervision. We achieve this by\nintroducing a new paradigm for learning neural gradient functions, which\nencourages the neural network to fit the input point clouds and yield unit-norm\ngradients at the points. Specifically, we introduce loss functions to\nfacilitate query points to iteratively reach the moving targets and aggregate\nonto the approximated surface, thereby learning a global surface representation\nof the data. Meanwhile, we incorporate gradients into the surface approximation\nto measure the minimum signed deviation of queries, resulting in a consistent\ngradient field associated with the surface. These techniques lead to our deep\nunsupervised oriented normal estimator that is robust to noise, outliers and\ndensity variations. Our excellent results on widely used benchmarks demonstrate\nthat our method can learn more accurate normals for both unoriented and\noriented normal estimation tasks than the latest methods.

      "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shown to be amongst the most important\nartificial intelligence (AI) techniques in educational applications, providing\nadaptive educational services. However, their educational potential is limited\nin practice due to three major challenges: i) difficulty in incorporating\nsymbolic educational knowledge (e.g., causal relationships, and practitioners'\nknowledge) in their development, ii) learning and reflecting biases, and iii)\nlack of interpretability. Given the high-risk nature of education, the\nintegration of educational knowledge into ANNs becomes crucial for developing\nAI applications that adhere to essential educational restrictions, and provide\ninterpretability over the predictions. This research argues that the\nneural-symbolic family of AI has the potential to address the named challenges.\nTo this end, it adapts a neural-symbolic AI framework and accordingly develops\nan approach called NSAI, that injects and extracts educational knowledge into\nand from deep neural networks, for modelling learners computational thinking.\nOur findings reveal that the NSAI approach has better generalizability compared\nto deep neural networks trained merely on training data, as well as training\ndata augmented by SMOTE and autoencoder methods. More importantly, unlike the\nother models, the NSAI approach prioritises robust representations that capture\ncausal relationships between input features and output labels, ensuring safety\nin learning to avoid spurious correlations and control biases in training data.\nFurthermore, the NSAI approach enables the extraction of rules from the learned\nnetwork, facilitating interpretation and reasoning about the path to\npredictions, as well as refining the initial educational knowledge. These\nfindings imply that neural-symbolic AI can overcome the limitations of ANNs in\neducation, enabling trustworthy and interpretable applications.",

      "abstract": "We present a multi-wavelength study of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs)\nin a sample of the 95 most massive galaxy clusters selected from South Pole\nTelescope (SPT) Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) survey. Our sample spans a redshift\nrange of 0.3 < z < 1.7, and is complete with optical spectroscopy from various\nground-based observatories, as well as ground and space-based imaging from\noptical, X-ray and radio wavebands. At z~0, previous studies have shown a\nstrong correlation between the presence of a low-entropy cool core and the\npresence of star-formation and a radio-loud AGN in the central BCG. We show for\nthe first time that a central entropy threshold for star formation persists out\nto z~1. The central entropy (measured in this work at a radius of 10 kpc) below\nwhich clusters harbor star-forming BCGs is found to be as low as $K_\\mathrm{10\n~ kpc} = 35 \\pm 4$ keV cm$^2$ at z < 0.15 and as high as $K_\\mathrm{10 ~ kpc} =\n52 \\pm 11$ keV cm$^2$ at z~1. We find only marginal (~1$\\sigma$) evidence for\nevolution in this threshold. In contrast, we do not find a similar high-z\nanalog for an entropy threshold for feedback, but instead measure a strong\nevolution in the fraction of radio-loud BCGs in high-entropy cores as a\nfunction of redshift. This could imply that the cooling-feedback loop was not\nas tight in the past, or that some other fuel source like mergers are fueling\nthe radio sources more often with increasing redshift, making the radio\nluminosity an increasingly unreliable proxy for radio jet power. We also find\nthat our SZ-based sample is missing a small (~4%) population of the most\nluminous radio sources ($\\nu L_{\\nu} > 10^{42}$ erg/s), likely due to radio\ncontamination suppressing the SZ signal with which these clusters are detected.",

      "abstract": "Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) is an emerging task in computer\nvision, which segments the target instances in images based on text\ndescriptions. However, its development is plagued by the expensive segmentation\nlabels. To address this issue, we propose a new learning task for RES called\nOmni-supervised Referring Expression Segmentation (Omni-RES), which aims to\nmake full use of unlabeled, fully labeled and weakly labeled data, e.g.,\nreferring points or grounding boxes, for efficient RES training. To accomplish\nthis task, we also propose a novel yet strong baseline method for Omni-RES\nbased on the recently popular teacher-student learning, where the weak labels\nare not directly transformed into supervision signals but used as a yardstick\nto select and refine high-quality pseudo-masks for teacher-student learning. To\nvalidate the proposed Omni-RES method, we apply it to a set of state-of-the-art\nRES models and conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of RES datasets. The\nexperimental results yield the obvious merits of Omni-RES than the\nfully-supervised and semi-supervised training schemes. For instance, with only\n10% fully labeled data, Omni-RES can help the base model achieve 100% fully\nsupervised performance, and it also outperform the semi-supervised alternative\nby a large margin, e.g., +14.93% on RefCOCO and +14.95% on RefCOCO+,\nrespectively. More importantly, Omni-RES also enable the use of large-scale\nvision-langauges like Visual Genome to facilitate low-cost RES training, and\nachieve new SOTA performance of RES, e.g., 80.66 on RefCOCO.",

The method is based on a series\nexpansion of a Stokes-flow solution (one satisfying a Navier slip boundary\ncondition) with non-dimensional slip length as the small expansion parameter.\nMost notably, first-order predictions of surface moments of the traction force\n(e.g., drag and torque) can be obtained purely from no-slip solutions to the\nsame problem. The analysis is directly applicable to microscale rarefied gas\nflows in the so-called `slip regime' and relevant to a range of liquid flows at\nthe microscale and nanoscale. A number of application examples are considered,\nwith expressions derived for: the drag and torque on translating and rotating\nJanus particles and spheroids (prolate and oblate); the efficiency of a micro\njournal bearing; the speed of a self-propelled particle (a `squirmer'); and the\npressure drop required to drive flow through long, straight micro/nano\nchannels. Where appropriate, accurate numerical calculations provide\nverification of the derived expressions. Certain general results are also\nobtained. For example, for low-slip Stokes flow: any surface distribution of\npositive slip length will reduce the drag on any translating particle; any\nperimetric distribution of positive slip length will reduce the pressure loss\nthrough a straight channel flow of arbitrary cross-section; unlike in no-slip\nflows, the rate of work done by a bounding solid surface on the fluid is not\nbalanced by dissipation in the fluid volume -- there is additional dissipation\nat the fluid-solid interface.",

Here,\nwe propose a quantum data visualization method using quantum kernels, which\nenables us to offer fast and highly accurate visualization of quantum states.\nIn our numerical experiments, we visualize hand-written digits dataset and\napply $k$-nearest neighbor algorithm to the low-dimensional data to\nquantitatively evaluate our proposed method compared with a classical kernel\nmethod. As a result, our proposed method achieves comparable accuracy to the\nstate-of-the-art classical kernel method, meaning that the proposed\nvisualization method based on quantum machine learning does not degrade the\nseparability of the input higher dimensional data. Furthermore, we visualize\nthe optimization trajectories of finding the ground states of transverse field\nIsing model and successfully find the trajectory characteristics. Since quantum\nstates are higher dimensional objects that can only be seen via observables,\nour visualization method, which inherits the similarity of quantum data, would\nbe useful in understanding the behavior of quantum circuits and algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Regularization in modern machine learning is crucial, and it can take various\nforms in algorithmic design: training set, model family, error function,\nregularization terms, and optimizations. In particular, the learning rate,\nwhich can be interpreted as a temperature-like parameter within the statistical\nmechanics of learning, plays a crucial role in neural network training. Indeed,\nmany widely adopted training strategies basically just define the decay of the\nlearning rate over time. This process can be interpreted as decreasing a\ntemperature, using either a global learning rate (for the entire model) or a\nlearning rate that varies for each parameter. This paper proposes TempBalance,\na straightforward yet effective layer-wise learning rate method. TempBalance is\nbased on Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) Theory, an approach which\ncharacterizes the implicit self-regularization of different layers in trained\nmodels. We demonstrate the efficacy of using HT-SR-motivated metrics to guide\nthe scheduling and balancing of temperature across all network layers during\nmodel training, resulting in improved performance during testing. We implement\nTempBalance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, and TinyImageNet datasets using\nResNets, VGGs, and WideResNets with various depths and widths. Our results show\nthat TempBalance significantly outperforms ordinary SGD and carefully-tuned\nspectral norm regularization.

      "abstract": "Multimodal (e.g., RGB-Depth/RGB-Thermal) fusion has shown great potential for\nimproving semantic segmentation in complex scenes (e.g., indoor/low-light\nconditions). Existing approaches often fully fine-tune a dual-branch\nencoder-decoder framework with a complicated feature fusion strategy for\nachieving multimodal semantic segmentation, which is training-costly due to the\nmassive parameter updates in feature extraction and fusion. To address this\nissue, we propose a surprisingly simple yet effective dual-prompt learning\nnetwork (dubbed DPLNet) for training-efficient multimodal (e.g., RGB-D/T)\nsemantic segmentation. The core of DPLNet is to directly adapt a frozen\npre-trained RGB model to multimodal semantic segmentation, reducing parameter\nupdates. For this purpose, we present two prompt learning modules, comprising\nmultimodal prompt generator (MPG) and multimodal feature adapter (MFA). MPG\nworks to fuse the features from different modalities in a compact manner and is\ninserted from shadow to deep stages to generate the multi-level multimodal\nprompts that are injected into the frozen backbone, while MPG adapts prompted\nmultimodal features in the frozen backbone for better multimodal semantic\nsegmentation. Since both the MPG and MFA are lightweight, only a few trainable\nparameters (3.88M, 4.4% of the pre-trained backbone parameters) are introduced\nfor multimodal feature fusion and learning. Using a simple decoder (3.27M\nparameters), DPLNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance or is on a par\nwith other complex approaches on four RGB-D/T semantic segmentation datasets\nwhile satisfying parameter efficiency. Moreover, we show that DPLNet is general\nand applicable to other multimodal tasks such as salient object detection and\nvideo semantic segmentation. Without special design, DPLNet outperforms many\ncomplicated models. Our code will be available at\ngithub.com/ShaohuaDong2021/DPLNet.",

      "title": "Event-driven Real-time Retrieval in Web Search",
      "abstract": "Information retrieval in real-time search presents unique challenges distinct\nfrom those encountered in classical web search. These challenges are\nparticularly pronounced due to the rapid change of user search intent, which is\ninfluenced by the occurrence and evolution of breaking news events, such as\nearthquakes, elections, and wars. Previous dense retrieval methods, which\nprimarily focused on static semantic representation, lack the capacity to\ncapture immediate search intent, leading to inferior performance in retrieving\nthe most recent event-related documents in time-sensitive scenarios. To address\nthis issue, this paper expands the query with event information that represents\nreal-time search intent. The Event information is then integrated with the\nquery through a cross-attention mechanism, resulting in a time-context query\nrepresentation. We further enhance the model's capacity for event\nrepresentation through multi-task training. Since publicly available datasets\nsuch as MS-MARCO do not contain any event information on the query side and\nhave few time-sensitive queries, we design an automatic data collection and\nannotation pipeline to address this issue, which includes ModelZoo-based Coarse\nAnnotation and LLM-driven Fine Annotation processes. In addition, we share the\ntraining tricks such as two-stage training and hard negative sampling. Finally,\nwe conduct a set of offline experiments on a million-scale production dataset\nto evaluate our approach and deploy an A/B testing in a real online system to\nverify the performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline\nmethods.",

      "abstract": "Text-guided 3D face synthesis has achieved remarkable results by leveraging\ntext-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. However, most existing works focus solely\non the direct generation, ignoring the editing, restricting them from\nsynthesizing customized 3D faces through iterative adjustments. In this paper,\nwe propose a unified text-guided framework from face generation to editing. In\nthe generation stage, we propose a geometry-texture decoupled generation to\nmitigate the loss of geometric details caused by coupling. Besides, decoupling\nenables us to utilize the generated geometry as a condition for texture\ngeneration, yielding highly geometry-texture aligned results. We further employ\na fine-tuned texture diffusion model to enhance texture quality in both RGB and\nYUV space. In the editing stage, we first employ a pre-trained diffusion model\nto update facial geometry or texture based on the texts. To enable sequential\nediting, we introduce a UV domain consistency preservation regularization,\npreventing unintentional changes to irrelevant facial attributes. Besides, we\npropose a self-guided consistency weight strategy to improve editing efficacy\nwhile preserving consistency. Through comprehensive experiments, we showcase\nour method's superiority in face synthesis. Project page:\nhttps://faceg2e.github.io/.",

Our paper aims to unveil the underlying mechanisms of the\nelectrical and magneto-transport in monolayer MoS2. In order to quantitatively\ninterpret the magneto-transport behavior of monolayer MoS2 on different\nsubstrate materials, identify the underlying bottlenecks, and provide\nguidelines for subsequent improvements, we present a deep analysis of the\nmagneto-transport properties in the diffusive limit. Our calculations are\nperformed on suspended monolayer MoS2 and MoS2 on different substrate materials\ntaking into account remote impurity and the intrinsic and extrinsic phonon\nscattering mechanisms. We calculate the crucial transport parameters such as\nthe Hall mobility, the conductivity tensor elements, the Hall factor, and the\nmagnetoresistance over a wide range of temperatures, carrier concentrations,\nand magnetic fields. The Hall factor being a key quantity for calculating the\ncarrier concentration and drift mobility, we show that for suspended monolayer\nMoS2 at room temperature, the Hall factor value is around 1.43 for magnetic\nfields ranging from 0.001 to 1 Tesla, which deviates significantly from the\nusual value of unity. In contrast, the Hall factor for various substrates\napproaches the ideal value of unity and remains stable in response to the\nmagnetic field and temperature. We also show that the MoS2 over an Al2O3\nsubstrate is a good choice for the Hall effect detector. Moreover, the\nmagnetoresistance increases with an increase in magnetic field strength for\nsmaller magnetic fields before reaching saturation at higher magnetic fields.\nThe presented theoretical model quantitatively captures the scaling of mobility\nand various magnetoresistance coefficients with temperature, carrier densities\nand magnetic fields.",

      "abstract": "The recovery of magnetic resonance (MR) images from undersampled measurements\nis a key problem that has seen extensive research in recent years. Unrolled\napproaches, which rely on end-to-end training of convolutional neural network\n(CNN) blocks within iterative reconstruction algorithms, offer state-of-the-art\nperformance. These algorithms require a large amount of memory during training,\nmaking them difficult to employ in high-dimensional applications. Deep\nequilibrium (DEQ) models and the recent monotone operator learning (MOL)\napproach were introduced to eliminate the need for unrolling, thus reducing the\nmemory demand during training. Both approaches require a Lipschitz constraint\non the network to ensure that the forward and backpropagation iterations\nconverge. Unfortunately, the constraint often results in reduced performance\ncompared to unrolled methods. The main focus of this work is to relax the\nconstraint on the CNN block in two different ways. Inspired by\nconvex-non-convex regularization strategies, we now impose the monotone\nconstraint on the sum of the gradient of the data term and the CNN block,\nrather than constrain the CNN itself to be a monotone operator. This approach\nenables the CNN to learn possibly non-monotone score functions, which can\ntranslate to improved performance. In addition, we only restrict the operator\nto be monotone in a local neighborhood around the image manifold. Our\ntheoretical results show that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge\nto the fixed point and that the solution is robust to input perturbations,\nprovided that it is initialized close to the true solution. Our empirical\nresults show that the relaxed constraints translate to improved performance and\nthat the approach enjoys robustness to input perturbations similar to MOL.",

      "abstract": "Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging is a significant and essential\nmedical imaging technique.However, multi-contrast imaging has longer\nacquisition time and is easy to cause motion artifacts. In particular, the\nacquisition time for a T2-weighted image is prolonged due to its longer\nrepetition time (TR). On the contrary, T1-weighted image has a shorter TR.\nTherefore,utilizing complementary information across T1 and T2-weighted image\nis a way to decrease the overall imaging time. Previous T1-assisted T2\nreconstruction methods have mostly focused on image domain using whole-based\nimage fusion approaches. The image domain reconstruction method has the defects\nof high computational complexity and limited flexibility. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel multi-contrast imaging method called partition-based\nk-space synthesis (PKS) which can achieve super reconstruction quality of\nT2-weighted image by feature fusion. Concretely, we first decompose\nfully-sampled T1 k-space data and under-sampled T2 k-space data into two\nsub-data, separately. Then two new objects are constructed by combining the two\nsub-T1/T2 data. After that, the two new objects as the whole data to realize\nthe reconstruction of T2-weighted image. Finally, the objective T2 is\nsynthesized by extracting the sub-T2 data of each part. Experimental results\nshowed that our combined technique can achieve comparable or better results\nthan using traditional k-space parallel imaging(SAKE) that processes each\ncontrast independently.",

      "abstract": "Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) locally on mobile devices presents a\nsignificant challenge due to their extensive memory requirements. In this\npaper, we introduce LinguaLinked, a system for decentralized, distributed LLM\ninference on mobile devices. LinguaLinked enables collaborative execution of\nthe inference task across multiple trusted devices. LinguaLinked ensures data\nprivacy by processing information locally. LinguaLinked uses three key\nstrategies. First, an optimized model assignment technique segments LLMs and\nuses linear optimization to align segments with each device's capabilities.\nSecond, an optimized data transmission mechanism ensures efficient and\nstructured data flow between model segments while also maintaining the\nintegrity of the original model structure. Finally, LinguaLinked incorporates a\nruntime load balancer that actively monitors and redistributes tasks among\nmobile devices to prevent bottlenecks, enhancing the system's overall\nefficiency and responsiveness. We demonstrate that LinguaLinked facilitates\nefficient LLM inference while maintaining consistent throughput and minimal\nlatency through extensive testing across various mobile devices, from high-end\nto low-end Android devices. In our evaluations, compared to the baseline,\nLinguaLinked achieves an inference performance acceleration of $1.11\\times$ to\n$1.61\\times$ in single-threaded settings, $1.73\\times$ to $2.65\\times$ with\nmulti-threading. Additionally, runtime load balancing yields an overall\ninference acceleration of $1.29\\times$ to $1.32\\times$.",

As a main result, we show that for every infinite metric space\n$M$, there exists a metric space $M_0 \\subseteq M$ such that the set of\npointwise norm-attaining Lipschitz functions on $M_0$ contains an isometric\ncopy of $c_0$.

Several new results on\n$c_0$-embedding and $\\ell_1$-embedding into the set of strongly norm-attaining\nLipschitz functions are presented as well. In particular, we show that if $M$\nis a subset of an $\\mathbb{R}$-tree containing all the branching points, then\nthe set of strongly norm-attaining Lipschitz functions contains $c_0$\nisometrically. As a related result, we provide an example of metric space $M$\nfor which the set of norm-attaining functionals on the Lipschitz-free space\nover $M$ cannot contain an isometric copy of $c_0$.

In\nthis paper, we focus on a group activity by which a group of users perform a\ncollaborative task without user identification and propose an efficient group\nactivity recognition scheme which extracts causality patterns from pervasive\nsensor event sequences generated by a group of users to support as good\nrecognition accuracy as the state-of-the-art graphical model. To filter out\nirrelevant noise events from a given data stream, a set of rules is leveraged\nto highlight causally related events. Then, a pattern-tree algorithm extracts\nfrequent causal patterns by means of a growing tree structure. Based on the\nextracted patterns, a weighted sum-based pattern matching algorithm computes\nthe likelihoods of stored group activities to the given test event sequence by\nmeans of matched event pattern counts for group activity recognition. We\nevaluate the proposed scheme using the data collected from our testbed and\nCASAS datasets where users perform their tasks on a daily basis and validate\nits effectiveness in a real environment.

      "abstract": "A threefold increase in the CO2 conversion and energy efficiency due to the\ncooling of the post-discharge region by the counter gas flow has been achieved\nin the plasma of an atmospheric pressure discharge supported by microwave\nradiation of a gyrotron with a frequency of 24 GHz in a carbon dioxide gas\nflow. The role of convective heat transfer in the process of gas mixture\ncooling in the post-discharge region has been experimentally demonstrated. At\nnitrogen quench gas flow of 4.5 l/min, the CO2 conversion was 23.8 % and energy\nefficiency was 19.7 %. The possibility of using the flow of cooled gas mixture\n(CO2,CO,O2) taken from the reactor as quenching gas has been experimentally\ndemonstrated, which made it possible to achieve a CO2 conversion degree of 23.4\n% and to eliminate the problem of dilution of reaction products by third-party\ngases. Based on numerical modeling, it is shown that the increase in the\nconversion degree upon the destruction of the plasma torch structure is due to\nthe increase in heat exchange with the surrounding atmosphere, and the\nefficiency of this destruction is determined by the velocity and density of\nquenching gas.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly pivotal in a wide range of\nnatural language processing tasks. Access to pre-trained models, courtesy of\nthe open-source community, has made it possible to adapt these models to\nspecific applications for enhanced performance. However, the substantial\nresources required for training these models necessitate efficient solutions.\nThis paper introduces CoLLiE, an efficient library that facilitates\ncollaborative training of large language models using 3D parallelism,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, and optimizers such as Lion,\nAdan, Sophia, LOMO and AdaLomo. With its modular design and comprehensive\nfunctionality, CoLLiE offers a balanced blend of efficiency, ease of use, and\ncustomization. CoLLiE has proven superior training efficiency in comparison\nwith prevalent solutions in pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios.\nFurthermore, we provide an empirical evaluation of the correlation between\nmodel size and GPU memory consumption under different optimization methods, as\nwell as an analysis of the throughput. Lastly, we carry out a comprehensive\ncomparison of various optimizers and PEFT methods within the instruction-tuning\ncontext. CoLLiE is available at https://github.com/OpenLMLab/collie.",

The dawn of multi-messenger high-energy\nastrophysics has been tremendously beneficial, as it allows us to study\nparticles with much higher energies and travelling much longer distances than\npossible in terrestrial experiments, but more progress is needed on several\nfronts.\n  A thorough appraisal of current strategies and experimental frameworks,\nregarding quantum gravity phenomenology, is provided here. Our aim is twofold:\na description of tentative multimessenger explorations, plus a focus on future\ndetection experiments.\n  As the outlook of the network of researchers that formed through the COST\nAction CA18108 \"Quantum gravity phenomenology in the multi-messenger approach\n(QG-MM)\", in this work we give an overview of the desiderata that future\ntheoretical frameworks, observational facilities, and data-sharing policies\nshould satisfy in order to advance the cause of quantum gravity phenomenology.",

      "abstract": "Programming language understanding and representation (a.k.a code\nrepresentation learning) has always been a hot and challenging task in software\nengineering. It aims to apply deep learning techniques to produce numerical\nrepresentations of the source code features while preserving its semantics.\nThese representations can be used for facilitating subsequent code-related\ntasks. The abstract syntax tree (AST), a fundamental code feature, illustrates\nthe syntactic information of the source code and has been widely used in code\nrepresentation learning. However, there is still a lack of systematic and\nquantitative evaluation of how well AST-based code representation facilitates\nsubsequent code-related tasks. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive\nempirical study to explore the effectiveness of the AST-based code\nrepresentation in facilitating follow-up code-related tasks. To do so, we\ncompare the performance of models trained with code token sequence (Token for\nshort) based code representation and AST-based code representation on three\npopular types of code-related tasks. Surprisingly, the overall quantitative\nstatistical results demonstrate that models trained with AST-based code\nrepresentation consistently perform worse across all three tasks compared to\nmodels trained with Token-based code representation. Our further quantitative\nanalysis reveals that models trained with AST-based code representation\noutperform models trained with Token-based code representation in certain\nsubsets of samples across all three tasks. We also conduct comprehensive\nexperiments to evaluate and reveal the impact of the choice of AST\nparsing/preprocessing/encoding methods on AST-based code representation and\nsubsequent code-related tasks. Our study provides future researchers with\ndetailed guidance on how to select solutions at each stage to fully exploit\nAST.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, circuit simulators and Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers\nhave been tightly integrated to provide efficient logic synthesis and\nverification. Circuit simulation can generate highly expressive simulation\npatterns that can either enumerate or filter out most candidates for synthesis.\nSubsequently, SAT solvers are employed to check those that remain, thereby\nmaking the logic synthesis process more efficient. This paper introduces a\nnovel circuit simulator of k-input lookup table (k-LUT) networks, based on\nsemi-tensor product (STP). STP-based simulators use computation of logic\nmatrices, the primitives of logic networks, as opposed to relying on bitwise\nlogic operations for simulation of k-LUT networks. Experimental results show\nthat our STP-based simulator reduces the runtime by an average of 7.2x.\nFurthermore, we integrate this proposed simulator into a SAT-sweeping engine\nknown as SAT sweeper. Through a combination of structural hashing, simulation,\nand SAT queries, SAT sweeper simplifies logic networks by systematically\nmerging graph vertices from input to output. To enhance the efficiency, we used\nSTP-based exhaustive simulation, which significantly reduces the number of\nfalse equivalence class candidates, thereby improving the computational\nefficiency by reducing the number of SAT calls required. When compared to the\nSOTA SAT sweeper, our method demonstrates an average 35% runtime reduction.",

Despite\nrecent progress, two-dimensional skyrmion hosts are still limited, due to the\nfact that most 2D magnets are centrosymmetric and thus lack\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). We show here, using a general analysis\nbased on symmetry, that Bloch-type skyrmions can, in fact, be stabilized in 2D\nmagnets, due to the interplay between in-plane component (dx) of second\nnearest-neighbor DMI and magnetic anisotropy. Its validity is demonstrated in\nthe Cr2Ge2Te6 monolayer, which is also verified by recent experiments.

      "abstract": "Understanding the generalization abilities of modern machine learning\nalgorithms has been a major research topic over the past decades. In recent\nyears, the learning dynamics of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) have been\nrelated to heavy-tailed dynamics. This has been successfully applied to\ngeneralization theory by exploiting the fractal properties of those dynamics.\nHowever, the derived bounds depend on mutual information (decoupling) terms\nthat are beyond the reach of computability. In this work, we prove\ngeneralization bounds over the trajectory of a class of heavy-tailed dynamics,\nwithout those mutual information terms. Instead, we introduce a geometric\ndecoupling term by comparing the learning dynamics (depending on the empirical\nrisk) with an expected one (depending on the population risk). We further\nupper-bound this geometric term, by using techniques from the heavy-tailed and\nthe fractal literature, making it fully computable. Moreover, as an attempt to\ntighten the bounds, we propose a PAC-Bayesian setting based on perturbed\ndynamics, in which the same geometric term plays a crucial role and can still\nbe bounded using the techniques described above.",

      "abstract": "Polygraphs are a higher-dimensional generalization of the notion of directed\ngraph. Based on those as unifying concept, this monograph on polygraphs\nrevisits the theory of rewriting in the context of strict higher categories,\nadopting the abstract point of view offered by homotopical algebra. The first\nhalf explores the theory of polygraphs in low dimensions and its applications\nto the computation of the coherence of algebraic structures. It is meant to be\nprogressive, with little requirements on the background of the reader, apart\nfrom basic category theory, and is illustrated with algorithmic computations on\nalgebraic structures. The second half introduces and studies the general notion\nof n-polygraph, dealing with the homotopy theory of those. It constructs the\nfolk model structure on the category of strict higher categories and exhibits\npolygraphs as cofibrant objects. This allows extending to higher dimensional\nstructures the coherence results developed in the first half.",

Here, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally how\nimposing an additional phase modulation on the acoustic periodic structure\ninduces a symmetry constraint leading to the annihilation of the Talbot effect.\nThis will significantly improve the acousto-optic image reconstruction quality\nand allows for an improvement of the reachable spatial resolution of the image.",

PEFTDebias consists of two main phases: an upstream phase for acquiring\ndebiasing parameters along a specific bias axis, and a downstream phase where\nthese parameters are incorporated into the model and frozen during the\nfine-tuning process. By evaluating on four datasets across two bias axes namely\ngender and race, we find that downstream biases can be effectively reduced with\nPEFTs. In addition, we show that these parameters possess axis-specific\ndebiasing characteristics, enabling their effective transferability in\nmitigating biases in various downstream tasks.

      "abstract": "Studying crop photosynthesis is crucial for improving yield, but current\nmethods are labor-intensive. This research aims to enhance accuracy by\ncombining leaf reflectance and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)\nsignals to estimate key photosynthetic traits in rice. The study analyzes 149\nleaf samples from two rice cultivars, considering reflectance, SIF,\nchlorophyll, carotenoids, and CO2 response curves. After noise removal, SIF and\nreflectance spectra are used for data fusion at different levels (raw, feature,\nand decision). Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) extracts\nfeatures, and partial least squares regression (PLSR) builds regression models.\nResults indicate that using either reflectance or SIF alone provides modest\nestimations for photosynthetic traits. However, combining these data sources\nthrough measurement-level data fusion significantly improves accuracy, with\nmid-level and decision-level fusion also showing positive outcomes. In\nparticular, decision-level fusion enhances predictive capabilities, suggesting\nthe potential for efficient crop phenotyping. Overall, sun-induced chlorophyll\nfluorescence spectra effectively predict rice's photosynthetic capacity, and\ndata fusion methods contribute to increased accuracy, paving the way for\nhigh-throughput crop phenotyping.",

Dolphins is\nadept at processing multimodal inputs comprising video (or image) data, text\ninstructions, and historical control signals to generate informed outputs\ncorresponding to the provided instructions. Building upon the open-sourced\npretrained Vision-Language Model, OpenFlamingo, we first enhance Dolphins's\nreasoning capabilities through an innovative Grounded Chain of Thought (GCoT)\nprocess. Then we tailored Dolphins to the driving domain by constructing\ndriving-specific instruction data and conducting instruction tuning. Through\nthe utilization of the BDD-X dataset, we designed and consolidated four\ndistinct AV tasks into Dolphins to foster a holistic understanding of intricate\ndriving scenarios. As a result, the distinctive features of Dolphins are\ncharacterized into two dimensions: (1) the ability to provide a comprehensive\nunderstanding of complex and long-tailed open-world driving scenarios and solve\na spectrum of AV tasks, and (2) the emergence of human-like capabilities\nincluding gradient-free instant adaptation via in-context learning and error\nrecovery via reflection.",

The new FAST image\nclearly reveals weak emission outside the ring due to its high sensitivity on\nlarge-scale structures. We derive a scale length of 2.7 kpc for the cosmic ray\nelectrons and find that the cosmic ray electrons propagate mainly through\ndiffusion by comparing the scale length at 4.8 GHz. The spectral index of the\ntotal intensity varies along the ring, which can be attributed to the variation\nof the spectra of synchrotron emission. This variation is likely caused by the\nchange of star formation rates along the ring. We find that the azimuthal\nprofile of the non-thermal emission can be interpreted by an axisymmetric\nlarge-scale magnetic field with varying pitch angle along the ring, indicating\na complicated magnetic field configuration in M31.",

      "abstract": "Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) represent a technology that\nautomates business processes, connecting users to their tasks. There are many\nbusiness processes within the port activity that can be improved through the\nuse of more efficient technologies and BPMS in particular, which can help to\ncoordinate and automate critical processes such as cargo manifests, customs\ndeclaration the management of scales, or dangerous goods, traditionally\nsupported by EDI technologies. These technologies could be integrated with\nBPMS, modernizing port logistics management. The aim of this work is to\ndemonstrate, through a systematic analysis of the literature, the state of the\nart in BPMS research in the port industry. For this, a systematic review of the\nliterature of the last ten years was carried out. The works generated by the\nsearch were subsequently analysed and filtered. After the investigation, it is\ndiscovered that the relationship between BPMS and the port sector is\npractically non-existent which represents an important gap to be covered and a\nfuture line of research.",

Despite the overwhelming progress,\nit still remains challenging for current approaches to perform well on cases\nwith various text expressions or with unseen visual entities, limiting its\nfurther application. In this paper, we present a novel RIS approach, which\nsubstantially improves the generalization ability by addressing the two\ndilemmas mentioned above. Specially, to deal with unconstrained texts, we\npropose to boost a given expression with an explicit and crucial prompt, which\ncomplements the expression in a unified context, facilitating target capturing\nin the presence of linguistic style changes. Furthermore, we introduce a\nmulti-modal fusion aggregation module with visual guidance from a powerful\npretrained model to leverage spatial relations and pixel coherences to handle\nthe incomplete target masks and false positive irregular clumps which often\nappear on unseen visual entities. Extensive experiments are conducted in the\nzero-shot cross-dataset settings and the proposed approach achieves consistent\ngains compared to the state-of-the-art, e.g., 4.15\\%, 5.45\\%, and 4.64\\% mIoU\nincrease on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and ReferIt respectively, demonstrating its\neffectiveness.

      "abstract": "Can we build an artificial system that would be able to generate endless\nsurprises if ran \"forever\" in Minecraft? While there is not a single path\ntoward solving that grand challenge, this article presents what we believe to\nbe some working ingredients for the endless generation of novel increasingly\ncomplex artifacts in Minecraft. Our framework for an open-ended system includes\ntwo components: a complex system used to recursively grow and complexify\nartifacts over time, and a discovery algorithm that leverages the concept of\nmeta-diversity search. Since complex systems have shown to enable the emergence\nof considerable complexity from set of simple rules, we believe them to be\ngreat candidates to generate all sort of artifacts in Minecraft. Yet, the space\nof possible artifacts that can be generated by these systems is often unknown,\nchallenging to characterize and explore. Therefore automating the long-term\ndiscovery of novel and increasingly complex artifacts in these systems is an\nexciting research field. To approach these challenges, we formulate the problem\nof meta-diversity search where an artificial \"discovery assistant\"\nincrementally learns a diverse set of representations to characterize behaviors\nand searches to discover diverse patterns within each of them. A successful\ndiscovery assistant should continuously seek for novel sources of diversities\nwhile being able to quickly specialize the search toward a new unknown type of\ndiversity. To implement those ideas in the Minecraft environment, we simulate\nan artificial \"chemistry\" system based on Lenia continuous cellular automaton\nfor generating artifacts, as well as an artificial \"discovery assistant\"\n(called Holmes) for the artifact-discovery process. Holmes incrementally learns\na hierarchy of modular representations to characterize divergent sources of\ndiversity and uses a goal-based intrinsically-motivated exploration as the\ndiversity search strategy.",

The work is motivated\nby the analysis of GPS trajectories of fishing vessels collected from\nregulatory tracking data in the context of marine biodiversity conservation and\necosystem-based fisheries management. We build a low-dimensional latent\nrepresentation of trajectories using convolutional neural networks as\nnon-linear mapping. This is done by training a conditional variational\nauto-encoder taking into account covariates. The posterior distributions of the\nlatent representations can be linked to the characteristics of the actual\ntrajectories. The latent distributions of the trajectories are compared with\nthe Bhattacharyya coefficient, which is well-suited for comparing\ndistributions. Using this coefficient, we analyse the variation of the\nindividual behaviour of each vessel during time. For collective behaviour\nanalysis, we build proximity graphs and use an extension of the stochastic\nblock model for multiple networks. This model results in a clustering of the\nindividuals based on their set of trajectories. The application to French\nfishing vessels enables us to obtain groups of vessels whose individual and\ncollective behaviours exhibit spatio-temporal patterns over the period\n2014-2018.",

The learning process usually incorporates\northogonalization to ensure orthonormal matrices. Our work reveals, through\ngradient analysis, that common orthogonalization procedures based on the\nGram-Schmidt process and singular value decomposition will slow down training\nefficiency. To this end, we advocate removing orthogonalization from the\nlearning process and learning unorthogonalized `Pseudo' Rotation Matrices\n(PRoM).

We\nobtained masses of states that fall into the irreducible representations of the\noctahedral group of rotations in combination with the quantum numbers of charge\nconjugation $C$ and parity $P$.

      "abstract": "A prompt is a sequence of symbol or tokens, selected from a vocabulary\naccording to some rule, which is prepended/concatenated to a textual query. A\nkey problem is how to select the sequence of tokens: in this paper we formulate\nit as a combinatorial optimization problem. The high dimensionality of the\ntoken space com-pounded by the length of the prompt sequence requires a very\nefficient solution. In this paper we propose a Bayesian optimization method,\nexecuted in a continuous em-bedding of the combinatorial space. In this paper\nwe focus on hard prompt tuning (HPT) which directly searches for discrete\ntokens to be added to the text input with-out requiring access to the large\nlanguage model (LLM) and can be used also when LLM is available only as a\nblack-box. This is critically important if LLMs are made available in the Model\nas a Service (MaaS) manner as in GPT-4. The current manu-script is focused on\nthe optimization of discrete prompts for classification tasks. The discrete\nprompts give rise to difficult combinatorial optimization problem which easily\nbecome intractable given the dimension of the token space in realistic\napplications. The optimization method considered in this paper is Bayesian\noptimization (BO) which has become the dominant approach in black-box\noptimization for its sample efficiency along with its modular structure and\nversatility. In this paper we use BoTorch, a library for Bayesian optimization\nresearch built on top of pyTorch. Albeit preliminary and obtained using a\n'vanilla' version of BO, the experiments on RoB-ERTa on six benchmarks, show a\ngood performance across a variety of tasks and enable an analysis of the\ntradeoff between size of the search space, accuracy and wall clock time.",

      "abstract": "There is a paucity of guidelines relating to displays in digital pathology\nmaking procurement decisions, and display configuration challenging. Experience\nsuggests pathologists have personal preferences for brightness when using a\nmicroscope which we hypothesised could be used as a predictor for display\nsetup. We conducted an online survey across 6 NHS hospitals to capture\nbrightness adjustment habits on both microscopes and screens. A subsample of\nrespondents took part in a practical task to determine microscope brightness\nand display luminance preferences.\n  The survey indicates 81% of respondents adjust the brightness on their\nmicroscope, compared with 11% adjusting their digital display. Display\nadjustments are more likely for visual comfort and ambient light compensation\nrather than for tissue factors, common for microscope adjustments. Twenty\nconsultants took part in the practical brightness assessment. Light preferences\non the microscope showed no correlation with screen preferences, except where a\npathologist has a markedly brighter microscope preference. All of the\npreferences in this cohort were for a display luminance of less than\n500cd/m$^2$, with 90% preferring 350cd/m$^2$ or less. There was no correlation\nbetween these preferences and the ambient lighting in the room.\n  We conclude that microscope preferences can only be used to predict screen\nluminance requirements where the microscope is being used at very high\nbrightness levels. A display capable of a brightness of 500cd/m$^2$ should be\nsuitable for almost all pathologists with 300cd/m$^2$ suitable for the\nmajority. The ability to adjust display luminance was felt to be important by\nthe majority of respondents. Further work needs to be undertaken to establish\nthe relationship between diagnostic performance, preferences and ambient\nlighting levels.",
